<p>Today, I was planning on posting about my trip to a museum. But, I’m also in Scotland.</p>
<p>Since I was in Scotland, I decided that I should try to take the opportunity ot listen to some Scottish Folk music. Last night, my friends convinced me not to go. So, tonight, I decided to go.</p>
<p>Of course, it turns out every pub operates on the “Folk Music Friday” “Standard Pop Saturday”<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> realm for music, so finding folk music was hard. I did end up being able to find a single pub with it, around a mile away.</p>
<p>By 2300<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> I was feeling tired, and so routed myself home. After a short walk, I found that the hotel I had routed myself was a different version of the hotel that I was staying at. So, I routed myself to the correct one. Then, at 2326, the unthinkable happened: my phone died. I became slightly worried.</p>
<p>But, I found out that people were very willing to respond to “hello, do you know how to get to the train station?”<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Of course, I soon learned that there were two train stations. Thankfully, my gut did tell me the right one, so I began heading. Somehow I ended up on a gradually curving set of streets which led me in a circle.</p>
<p>Talk about disappointing. I was so excited to see familiar sites, only to realize that it was where I had just been. Eventually, I found my way to the train station, although it was much larger than I remembered. I found a hotel, which had a map and a very helpful man who was willing to draw directions to my hotel. I found a familiar site finally, and made my way home.</p>
<p>Highlights: two drunk men, who “aren’t from around here” asking everyone near me for directions to the train station. But, I did hear some music, even though it was a little disappointing. I also managed to take more than 30000 steps, which is a lot for me.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Time for some sleep.</p>
