<p>Prereading note: I definitely have far more footnotes here (59 in total, 34 in the final draft) than normal (between 1 and 17 in total, and between 1 and 10 in the final draft) in my blog thus far. I have no clue why I felt the need for so many notes while writing this post, but they feel pretty needed. Additionally, since nested footnotes are apparently so frowned upon in different style circles that my editor doesn’t support them at all, nested notes will go in (), and if I doubly nest, I’ll use other [], and will continue to add as needed.</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>This spring, I started learning the Scottish bagpipes.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> While learning the bagpipe, one of my cross-country running friends<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> asked me if I would be willing to play the (United States’) National Anthem<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> at the Grinnell team’s only home meet, the Les Duke Invite. That meet is today, and (I think) just ended at the time of my writing this post. Obviously, I was unable to be there. But, their mentioning of the idea did spark me to try to find a bagpipe arrangement for The Star-Spangled Banner.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Initial searches were fairly fruitless, with what versions I could find sounding nothing like the anthem I knew.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> I found a <a href="http://www.therealviperpiper.com/viewtopic.php?t=11731">forum</a> discussing this, and they concluded that the anthem is unplayable on the bagpipes.</p>
<p>Now, those of you who know me may know that I don’t take being told something is impossible well.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> It feels like a challenge. Some of you may also know that I<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> compose music. The brilliant<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> part of my mind thought that I would be able to arrange the piece for bagpipes. Obviously,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a>that wouldn’t fit the song,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> which requires an octave and a fifth range,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a>, and some chromatic notes.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> But, you can always drop and raise octaves to fit a piece in. Additionally, my teacher mentioned offhandedly that there are chromatic fingerings for the bagpipe. So, I worked off of a version of the piece in the key of G.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>There I ran into my first problem: I have no clue how to play a C natural on a bagpipe, which was required in the second half of the piece.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> But, more importantly than that, it was centered around G,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> which those of you familiar with harmonics may see is dissonant to A.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>When I asked a friend of mine who plays bagpipes,<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> he told me that, in his experience, people would play the second half of the song,<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> because the first half isn’t doable. That’s when I suddenly realized that there’s a modulation in the middle of The Star Spangled Banner.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> With that in mind, I transposed the end of the piece to D major, which worked pretty well.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> I then put the initial half back in the song.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> I expected some cognitive dissonance from the<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> modulation in my version of the piece, but it was fairly minor. And, since the piece was centered around D, it fit in nicely with the harmonics of the instrument.</p>
<p>Then came to the part of arranging for bagpipe that I struggle with: adding the embellishments. The bagpipe plays a continuous note, so to break up repeated notes,<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> small chirpy notes are played to break the sound. There are many kinds of embellishments, including grace notes,<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a>, doublings and half doublings,<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> and many others. As you might expect from a musical tradition lasting centuries, there’s a lot of theory behind deciding what embellishments go where<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> which I don’t know and can’t easily find only. So, I put in embellishments that I knew<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> and looked right where they were, then tried playing through. Nothing looked or sounded horrible to me, but I also don’t know enough to know if anything I do would be horrible. So, now I have a version of the National Anthem of the United States of America that fits entirely on the bagpipe. If anyone wants it, feel free to drop me a message at <a href="mailto:flyingrebelpipes@gmail.com">flyingrebelpipes@gmail.com</a>. My only request if you end up using the piece is that you send me a recording of yourself playing it.</p>
