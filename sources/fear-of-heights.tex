\section{Draft 1}
One of the things I tend to forget is that I have somewhat of a fear of heights.
More than that, I have a fear of jumping off tall heights.
Maybe that isn't a fear, the more that I think about it, and just a reasonable reaction.

Nonetheless, since I was never afraid of one meter, seldom of three, and not at all afraid of jumping off of five meter platforms, I decided that I would try jumping off of the 10 meter platform tonight.
I got to the 7 meter, and began climbing up to the 10.

I didn't realize how close to the roof I was, especially since it seemed so high before I started.
Wow that was scary.

But, I jumped.
I was in the air way too long.
And then I hit the water.
Next week I'll try going in head first.
