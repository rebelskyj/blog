First Posted: 2018 October 11
\section{Draft 2}
One of my biggest concerns about studying abroad was how homesick I might get.
For those of you unfamiliar,\footnote{and unable to use google} I've lived my entire life in the same beautiful city\footnote{gotta love Iowa definitions} of 8000 or so people.
This semester, I decided that I would spend a semester of my life 4100 miles away, in a city of many millions.

I was expecting some culture shock, which I wrote about \href{small-changes.html}{earlier}.
But, I was also expecting to get homesick, if only because all of my friends told me I'd feel that way.

Now, the only time I've ever been truly homesick was, strangely enough, at a camp at Grinnell College.\footnote{more details may come in the future, if I feel introspective but have nothing else to write about}
But, I'd never spent so much time away from family, friends, and familiar surroundings.
And, the first night, I worried a lot about how homesick I might feel, to the point that I began to feel a little homesick.

But, in the 43 days that have followed,\footnote{also, I just realized I'd almost forgotten my daily beard photo. Thank goodness for this post} that's the only homesickness I've felt.
I've still got another 70 or so, but I don't think it's going to suddenly come on.
So, yay!
No homesick for me.
