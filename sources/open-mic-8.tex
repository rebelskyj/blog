\section{Draft 1}
Woo! I made it to two open mics in a row.
This week, I played the first few songs I planned on.
Unfortunately, I ran out of time before I could do anything past the originals.
Still, it was fun!
I played it all with a capo third fret and a pick, which was weird.

\begin{itemize}
\item I did a lot of work on my presentation, and it's basically done. That's nice, though terrifying
\item I have given up these past few days on entropy. 
\item Took a few days off.
\item Made it to three chapters last week. At around 1.4 so far this week.
\item I have stopped writing poetry, should get back into it.
\item As above but with letters/journals.
\item As above but with song.
\item As above but stretching.
\item As above, but excuse is that celebrations happening! More emphasis to come.
\item I have fallen off this as well, which I feel most annoyed about.
