\section{Draft 1}
How has it been almost two weeks since my last post?
Intellectually it makes sense, but wow the passage of time is hard.

Anyways, I did finish the blanket which is exciting, and I'm again coming to the realization that when I stop exercising I also stop being productive.
I haven't been running or stretching really, which really puts a damper on my monthly goals.
But, inspired by a friend making a book review blog, I think I might start reviewing books here.

Why, you\footnote{my hypothetical reader/future self} might ask, would I do that?
At worst, I have a record of books I read and how I felt at the time.
At best, I have a way to fill up days that I have nothing to write about.
It should also help hold me accountable for not reading books that I don't want to review.\footnote{because they lack any merit, no other reason}
Then again, I may not actually review everything I read.

Anyways, that's all.
