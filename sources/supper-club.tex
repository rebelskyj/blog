\section{Draft 1}
This was supposed to come out Friday, but life got in the way.

Anyways, this past Friday I went to my first supper club.
It's apparently a Wisconsin thing.
More or less, it felt like a restaurant, with a major difference: you did all the food ordering before getting a seat, only getting a table when your food was ready.
It was great to see a friend before they leave Madison!
