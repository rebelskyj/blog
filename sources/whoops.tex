\section{Draft 1}
Today, I was planning on posting my final diary essay.
Unfortunately, I never saved the document, and apparently closed it.
So, I lost the 12 drafts that I wrote, and only have the final draft.
Goes to show what your professors always tell you: save early and often.
But, I still have the final draft, which I'll probably post tomorrow when I'm feeling less annoyed at myself.
