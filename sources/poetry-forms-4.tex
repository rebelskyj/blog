\section{Draft 1}
Two weeks later I have written no more poems.
It's a really sad thing for me to realize: I love when I write poems but I don't make time for it.
I'm not sure what stops me from making time, especially with how much I waste, but I'm not sure how to encourage myself to write more.
Anyways, here's a fun\footnote{to write at least} double acrostic again.

Try Again\\
Take heed of everything you're not\\
Repeat so to remember \\
Yet never heed your fancy\\

Attempting once again may let a\\
Grain or some small egg\\
Attach itself or grow an anima\\
Instead of ever rising ennui\\
Nature's choice for to assign\\

Well that was really rough.
I'm unsure if it's a reflection on the time I'm writing it, my general mental capacity, the time between poems, or just the words I chose, but I'm not at all happy with this poem.
Maybe I'll edit it tomorrow.
