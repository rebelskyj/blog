\section{Draft 1}
It's been around 8 months since I \href{novel-update-6.html}{last updated} the blog about a novel I was working on.\footnote{apparently}
I tried to work on it until around June, but gave up for whatever reason.

I've decided that I do like a lot of the things I was working on in the book, so I want to rework it.
Unlike what I was doing before, though, I think that this time I would like to revise the book by going through and fully rewriting it.
Currently I'm working on plotting out when I want to hit certain plot points.\footnote{pun intended}
I've never tried writing a book like this before, so I hope that it ends up working better for me.
