\section{Draft 1}
As \href{will-he-or-wont-he.html}{I mentioned a while ago}, I've been meaning to go to the London Uillean Piper's club.
I finally made it.

It was really fun, and I'm glad I went once, if only for the chance to try the instrument.
However, since I didn't get back until nearly 12:15 in the morning, I don't think it's going to be something I go to again.
But, I'm glad I had the chance to try it once
