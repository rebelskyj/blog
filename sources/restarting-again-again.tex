\section{Draft 1}
Wow! A year ago two days from now I \href{restarting-again}{wrote} my last reflection on how I gave up on writing this blog.
Unlike then, I do kind of regret this break.
It wasn't planned, it just sort of happened.

I have been keeping up on my \href{creative-hobbies.html}{creative} hobbies, another difference from last year.
However, I do find that I still become ungrounded and disconnected without blogging.\footnote{'blogging?}

So, a few updates:\footnote{Which I'll probably blog about in the future days?}\\
\begin{itemize}
\item I passed my candidacy exam!
\item I have kept writing the book that I talked about before giving up
\item I started a new book
\end{itemize}

Anyways, hopefully I'll be able to get back to doing this daily!\footnote{I'm going to be counting this in my daily writing, which I have a goal for this month.}
