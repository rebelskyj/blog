\section{Draft 1}
It was just \href{writathon-23-april.html}{yesterday} that I talked about how I'd like to keep up writing even though I no longer need to.
As it turns out, I am incredibly motivated by deadlines.
Without the explicit need to write 2000 words to put out a chapter today, I didn't end up writing more than 1000 total words, and almost all of those came after 5pm.
I need to think of how to make myself write even when there's not a deadline.
At worst, that seems like a skill I should be able to transfer.
