\section{Draft 1}
Today is the Feast of All Souls.
There's an indulgence attached to praying at a graveyard.
A friend invited me to go pray at a graveyard with them, and it was really nice.
Unfortunately, the rest of today was jam-packed with activities, so I haven't really had time to sit and reflect here.

More accurately, I don't have time.
