\section{Draft 1}
Lasterday I wrote about creative hobbies, so it seems only fair that today I talk about one of mine.
Currently I'm moving my art from celtic knots to not doing to some symmetric art.
My current piece is a line art that has vertical and horizontal symmetry.

I've almost finished, so have to decide on my next one.
