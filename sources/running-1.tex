\section{Draft 1}
When \href{running.html}{last I mused about running}, I mentioned that I had achieved my goal of running 3 continuous miles.
My goal with that post was to prepare for the race I ran today, which at the time was set to 5.39 miles, but ended up being 5.1 or so.
My mile splits were much more regular, and I ended up going faster in my first three miles today than I did in my 5K, which is fun to realize as I write this post.

That being said, I did not train really at all in August.
Near as I can tell, I went for a single run in August, which was only about 1.5 miles.
Still, I decided I wanted to run the race today, and I managed to run the entire time.\footnote{for very slow definitions of run}
It's really cool to know that I can, in fact, run as long as I end up needing to.

All this being said, I still don't really love running.
I think I'm going to take up swimming again.
Expect future musings on that.
