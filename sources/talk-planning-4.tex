\section{Draft 1}
Today I started working on the actual presentation portion of my presentation, rather than just the content.
I really like the images showing how graphs of x=cos(at), y=sin(bt) change for different values of a and b.
As a result, I spent most of the morning learning how to make gifs in python.\footnote{it's shockingly easy}

Of course, then I had a bunch of pretty traces, and I am nothing if not easily distracted.
So, I now all of the a=b+1 for odd a up to 99.
They look really pretty, but they definitely distracted me from my actual goal, which was getting slides prepped.
Also, I'm remembering now that Kepler points to regular polygons for his analysis of shapes, which means I might have wasted all this time.
Eh, c'est la vie.
