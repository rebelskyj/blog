\section{Draft 1}
So species counterpoint reflection is on Wednesdays now.
Fourth species is an interesting challenge to me.
More than any other species\footnote{so far at least}, it makes me want to work entirely back to front.

That is, I know what note I want to end on, and the penultimate note and often antipenultimate note.
Once I've gotten those notes, the way that suspensions works means that I often have at most a single choice to meet the rules.
It's kind of interesting in a way.

That being said, I for sure need to spend at least the full week on fourth species.
It's not intuitive for me yet.
