\section{Draft 1}
Today, for the first time in\footnote{I think} 10 or so years, Grinnell College had a\footnote{partial} snow day.
Classes after 3 pm were cancelled.\footnote{nominally. Athletics had \say{optional} practices, and one ensemble still had required rehearsal}
Academic buildings were locked, and the Bear shut down.
It's weird.
I don't like it.
