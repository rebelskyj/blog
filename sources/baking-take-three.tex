\section{Draft 1}
Today I tried baking again.
Instead of the attempts I'd made before, where I made one full-size cake, and asked for others to compare to no reference, today I made 5 small recipes and had comparisons from there.
The five recipes I tested were: the original, browned butter and coffee, browned then cooled butter and coffee, just coffee, and just browned butter.
I had two amazing friends who were willing to taste test for me.

Sadly, one person's favorite\footnote{as is often the case} was the other's least favorite: browned butter and coffee
That was the browned and coffeed recipe.
Both found the browned, coffeeless recipe a close second, so that appears to be a good choice.
However, the original was also one's favorite and the other's third favorite.
So, I'll probably try those two recipes on Saturday, as I have a chance to talk to the judge again.
