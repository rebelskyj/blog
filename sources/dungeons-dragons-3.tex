\section{Draft 1}
As with my last two posts about Dungeons and Dragons, I again was playing at the same friend's house with the same DM.
This was the third session in our module, which was prewritten by WotC.
I predicted one of the major plot reveals,\footnote{I can't remember the word for that right now} which was that the wise mentor on the island dedicated to dragons was, herself, a dragon.
It's been a fun time so far, and I'm really excited to finish out this module before starting another one.
I don't have much more to say right now, though I'm sure I'll have more to say tomorrow.
