\section{\href{making-a-box.html}{On Making a High Voltage Box}}
First Published: 2022 February 3

\section{Draft 1}
A project I finished today was a box to make the high voltage setup in my lab more safe.
It was really fun!

The electronics and machine shop at my university are incredible, and the people there are fantastic.
It made the fact that I knew nothing about what I was doing not at all stressful.

I'm super glad that I get to work in a place that has such support for researchers.
