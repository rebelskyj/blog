<p>Today, I was planning on posting my final diary essay. Unfortunately, I never saved the document, and apparently closed it. So, I lost the 12 drafts that I wrote, and only have the final draft. Goes to show what your professors always tell you: save early and often. But, I still have the final draft, which I’ll probably post tomorrow when I’m feeling less annoyed at myself.</p>
