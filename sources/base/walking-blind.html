<p>As most of you alleged readers know, I have somewhat bad vision. And, since we live in the future, we have wearable technology that corrects for that. Most of the time, I correct my vision with glasses. On occasion, I correct it with contacts. And then there are the nights like tonight.</p>
<p>While going about my day, I paused in my room to do some homework.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Upon preparing to leave the dorm for a talk about maps that shaped America,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> I realized I couldnâ€™t find my glasses. So, knowing that I knew how to get to the talk fine without seeing detail, I set off.</p>
<p>London is a much different city with poor vision. Crowds of people, who normally I didnâ€™t register, suddenly seemed so much more sinister. My own shadow, distorted by street lights, gave me pause, as I thought I had a pursuer.</p>
<p>But, I made it to the talk safe, oddly enough. Today was nice, if only to remind myself both how blessed I am to have correctable vision, and how even the smallest of changes can drastically affect how we see the world.</p>
