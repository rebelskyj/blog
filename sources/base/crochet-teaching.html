<p>First, I want to apologize for the url for this posting.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> As much as I do think that it is important for the urls I use to be meaningful, I have more and more begun to realize that I am not yet good at using command line, and so can only find blog posts by the beginning of their names. Since this post is about teaching crochet, it could easily be teaching-crochet. However, since I am pretty sure that I’m going to be reflecting more on the crochet than the teaching, I think that it’s worthwhile for me to have the title focus on crochet, rather than teaching.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Anyways, today I helped teach some friends and colleagues how to crochet. I hadn’t realized quite how ingrained the muscle memory was for me, but I found that I kept needing to go far slower than I expected to explain a concept. Understanding the way that the yarn moves and needs to move to make crochet work is something that becomes intuitive, but certainly does not begin as such.</p>
<p>We were trying to make granny squares, which may not have been the best idea, in retrospect. The first fifteen or so stitches in a granny square look really ugly even if doing everything correctly, and it can be difficult to understand where mistakes arose when they inevitably do. I got to practice a little bit of classroom management, though, which was really nice.</p>
