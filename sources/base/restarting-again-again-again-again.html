<p>At some point I should really stop just appending a new again to the end of the title. Of course, at some point I should really either stop giving up on the blog or give up on it forever.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> That being said, neither of those are happening now.</p>
<p>I’ve started to get the familiar summer itch<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> to restart the blog, and so here we are. Very few updates since last time, though of course, if you’re interested, they’re mostly available on my <a href="twenty-five.html">yearly goal tracker</a>. In general, I think that I’ve been doing fairly well, which is nice to be able to say.</p>
<p>Anyways, I’ve now basically given up on the post for the day, so I’m going to post this. Hopefully tomorrow I’ll be up to the rest of the reflecting I should do.</p>

That being said, I do generally feel like the majority of points in my life are at least not worsened by the presence of a daily blog post, and it does help me to remain more reflective<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2" role="doc-endnote"><p>ok so scrolling through the calendar of my posts, it doesn’t really seem like there’s a rhythm or rhyme based on the pseudo solar calendar we all know and love<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
