<p>Isaiah 60:4A: “Raise your eyes and look about; they all gather and come to you.”</p>

<p>Today’s readings focus on the first time that we see people recognize the Lord in his human incarnation.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> And, as the other readings point out, this is the answer to Isaiah’s prophecy, that “[Jerusalem’s] light has come, the glory of the Lord shines upon [it].”<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> And, perhaps because I went to a Mass in Haitian Creole, where the priest made a point of mention that the Mass is the same in any language, other than the words themselves,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> that’s the part of the readings I’ve focused on.</p>
<p>The first reading tells us that all will gather and come to see the Lord. And, as the Mass is the same in every language, we can truly be a catholic<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> church, one where all can join in the song.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> In this way, the message of today’s readings is especially relevant to the random happenstance of life. It’s nice when that happens.</p>
