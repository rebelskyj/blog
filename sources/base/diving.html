<p>I dove for the first time in London today, and it was great. I forgot how much I love diving. After my second dive, the coach said “wow you look really happy up there.” Sorry this is so abrupt, but my legs hurt from pole dancing,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and I’m tired. Can’t wait to be diving with the team again though.</p>
