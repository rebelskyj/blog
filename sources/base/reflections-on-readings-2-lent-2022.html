<p>Psalm 27:1A: “The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom should I fear?”</p>

<p>Today’s Gospel is a little bit confusing for me. It’s the Transfiguration of our Lord, which has its own day in the calendar. Still, though, it’s a beautiful reading.</p>
<p>In the past, it confused me how Peter, John, and James recognized Elijah and Moses. After all, there were no photos of them, so how would they be recognizable. As I’ve gotten older, though, I think I have an answer for me, if not necessarily a theologically strong one.</p>
<p>The apostles knew the faces of Elijah and Moses because the Lord gave them the knowledge.</p>
