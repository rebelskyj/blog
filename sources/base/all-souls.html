<p>Today is the Feast of All Souls. Thereâ€™s an indulgence attached to praying at a graveyard. A friend invited me to go pray at a graveyard with them, and it was really nice. Unfortunately, the rest of today was jam-packed with activities, so I havenâ€™t really had time to sit and reflect here.</p>
<p>More accurately, I donâ€™t have time.</p>
