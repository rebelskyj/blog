<p>For a variety of reasons,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I haven’t been going to open mics since around February. I went again tonight, and I forgot just how much fun they are. I got to sing a song that I’ve been working on for a while,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> and at the prompting of a friend I sang a great song with another friend.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> The friend who made the recommendation is also a fantastic musician and was willing to take requests. It’s really fun singing Three is a Magic Number<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> with other adults, especially when everyone is over trying to look cool.</p>
<p>I’m really excited to make open mics a regular part of my schedule again.</p>
