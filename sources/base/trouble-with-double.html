<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today, as with most days for the next few weeks, I dove. Our goal was to run through every dive, with the added hope that I might be able to put inward two and a half back in.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Instead, I remembered why I hate inwards.</p>
<p>In front category dives, I tend to have an easy time. Regardless of how I ride the board, I can generally save it.</p>
<p>In back dives, I just need to remember to swing my arms. And, I do that often enough.</p>
<p>For reverse, I always know that I’ve gotten off the board too quickly.</p>
<p>But, for inward, the only element I really need to throw a quickly rotating dive is a good toe drive. That is, I need to throw my feet back as they come up from the board. Throwing my feet is scary, and makes me think I might hit the board.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> So, today’s inward double attempts were interesting.</p>
<p>On the first, I underthrew just enough that I landed in what the lifeguard called a “#1”<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The second I underthrew to the point that it turned into a one and a half, because I knew I wouldn’t make it, and I’ve never been horribly fond of hurting my back.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> After recognizing this problem and addressing it through an inward dive,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> I thought myself ready to again attempt inward double. Instead of it being under, I had a wonderful toe drive. In fact, I rotated so well that I was able to kick out at the double above the board.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this meant that I was over on the dive, and it didn’t feel pleasant. Had it been a leadup for inward two and a half or double on one meter, it would have been great. As it was, however, it was just painful. But, tomorrow is another day, and another chance to try again.</p>
