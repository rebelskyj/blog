Realized that I want to make sure I’m getting the proper micronutrients from fruits and vegetables, and wanted to start listing that</h1>
<p>I just finished meeting with a nutritionist. In general, the advice was good, practical, and not particularly enlightening.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> That being said, I was advised to generally eat more often, which is absolutely a good idea. I’d like to plan to start eating lunch and dinner daily, along with two snacks of peanuts and maybe a fruit. The macro breakdown in draft one shows me that’s probably doable, and so now it’s time to make sure I get my <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/phytonutrients-paint-your-plate-with-the-colors-of-the-rainbow-2019042516501">recommended plants</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Red: lycopene containing. Examples they give<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> are strawberries, cranberries, raspberries, tomatoes, cherries, apples<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, and red peppers.</p></li>
<li><p>Orange and yellow: beta cryptothanxin<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>, which becomes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%92-Cryptoxanthin">Vitamin A</a>. Yellow peppers, carrots, oranges, bananas, mango, pineapple, corn</p></li>
<li><p>Green: sulforaphane, isothiocyanates, and indoles<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>. Spinach, asparagus, alfalfa sprouts, collard greens, green tea.</p></li>
<li><p>Blue and purple: anthocyanins<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>. Blueberries, blackberries, concord grapes<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>, raisins, plum, fig, prune, lavender. This one might be a little harder, since the berries are generally available only in small quantities, and I don’t love any of the other options. I might need to start doing dry plums, though then I should look and see how many a day I might need.</p></li>
<li><p>White and brown: allicin<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>. Onion, garlic, leeks, parsnips, mushroom</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, frozen fruit is an equally viable option. The site claims I should shoot for about 4.5 cups a day of fruits and veggies<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The book I was using for macros does not provide specific guidance, so that seems like a reasonable enough goal. Writing my shopping list for next week, then:<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Rotisserie Chicken. Good source of protein, and I can just take chunks to work for my lunch.</p></li>
<li><p>Frozen meatballs<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Hard cheese for lunches<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Upon reflection, a soft or spreadable cheese could also be nice, because I will have bread with lunch</p></li>
<li><p>Frozen cherries or strawberries or fresh cherry<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> tomato</p></li>
<li><p>Carrots</p></li>
<li><p>Spinach<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Dry plums?</p></li>
<li><p>Mushroom</p></li>
<li><p>Peanuts</p></li>
<li><p>Whole Wheat Flour</p></li>
<li><p>Vital Wheat gluten</p></li>
<li><p>Seeds for bread</p></li>
<li><p>Apples</p></li>
</ul>
<p>My lunch each day will shoot for 30 grams of protein, and I’m hoping for it to include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Chicken, about 100 grams<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Some <a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/328637/nutrients">hard cheese</a>, probably 50 grams<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>A small loaf of a fruit<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> and nut studded<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> bread<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Some form of mushroom, ideally at least? Maybe make a little pate?</p></li>
<li><p>Spinach, one handful</p></li>
<li><p>One apple</p></li>
<li><p>Mug green tea</p></li>
<li><p>Carrot</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The snack container, having just been measured, is about 3.5 oz, so my snack(s) will be:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>3.5 oz peanut<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Piece of fruit? I think that I still may need to get in a red, in which case maybe strawberries.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Here we go!</p>
<p>Daily Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Practiced guitar? Not yet today, generally decently though.</p></li>
<li><p>Twice daily stretching? It was going well until Tuesday</p></li>
<li><p>Poetry? Kind of completely stopped.</p></li>
<li><p>Blog? Lost track of time last Friday, stayed out too late, lost Saturday to that<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a>, lost Sunday to that, and here we are.</p></li>
<li><p>Net cleaner home? I think so! I’m optimistic about going forward.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I only drew once, on Sunday, but I did manage to write and send out a letter<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a>.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-17-january-2025">Draft 1: 17 January 2025</h1>
<p><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>I just finished meeting with a nutritionist!<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> In general, there was nothing particularly life altering about the advice she gave. I feel mixed about that, as I tend to when no easy solutions present themselves.</p>
<p>On the one hand, it’s nice to know that I wasn’t just failing to do the proper research or draw the correct conclusions. On the other, it’s kind of frustrating to go into a situation with a  problem and leave the situation with the same problem.</p>
<p>That being said, though, there were three pieces of advice that she gave which I think may become helpful for me in the coming weeks.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Make sure to be eating every 4 hours.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> I keep seeing different times for how often one should be eating, and while I know I’ve seen some data suggesting other timelines, 4 hours is a reasonable enough goal to keep.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Break the protein up throughout the day, and in particular, make sure to eat snacks.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Set timers to stop working and, even if I don’t eat anything, check in with myself to see if I do want to eat anything.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Other pieces of advice that I found useful, though less so:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Make sure to count the protein in everything I eat. I tend to do this, but I do sometimes think I might forget to when I’m ball parking the total consumption.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t be afraid of premade meals. In particular, rotisserie chickens and frozen meatballs are my friend.</p></li>
<li><p>More fruits and veggies is never a bad thing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s see what peanuts<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> are like in terms of their protein efficiency. Looks like it’s around 170<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> calories per ounce, and about 7 grams of protein in that same space. Converting to grams, that means I’d need about 364 grams of peanuts a day, or about 13 oz.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> That’s really not bad!</p>
<p>So, assuming that I eat two meals<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a>, if I’m awake for 16 hours a day, I should be eating at least two snacks. I’m going to start shooting for 3-5 ounces<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> of peanuts at each of these snacks. That means I’ll be getting between 21 and 35 grams per snack, for a total of 42 to 70 grams per day. Oh, yeah ok if I can eat 10 ounces of peanuts a day, I should have no trouble finding the other 20 grams from somewhere. Looking at the price per gram of protein, it’s about 2 cents an ounce.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>Since I will generally be in my office from 8:30 to 5<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a>, I can do two snacks and a lunch<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a>, which is great. Assuming that I can manage 25 grams of protein in the lunch<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a>, I only need that much again for dinner! That’s so much easier, and if I make my lunch:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Wildly, apples are not red fruits in the sense of containing lycopene.</p></li>
</ul>
