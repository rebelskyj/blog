<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>Like I’ve mentioned before, I<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> compose. But, that composition is always alyrical or setting words to music. But, today on the bus I was playing with the<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> ukulele.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Someone asked me to sing a song about them, so I tried to make one up.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, I thought it was better than those around me. A heckler told me that I needed rhymes. There I remembered I do horribly under pressure. But, as I pushed through, I remembered how to think of rhymes and rhythms in real time.</p>
<p>Then the ride ended and we got off the bus.</p>
<p>So, on the journey home, my mind was running with creative song ideas. Since pop country is the furthest acceptable genre from pure country music allowed in rural Iowa, I decided that I would write in that genre. The fact that there aren’t many genres that you can do<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> with male voice and ukulele helped me come to that conclusion/</p>
<p>As I started writing though, I’d get stuck about one couplet<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> into each set of lyrics. Every so often I’d end up with a whole verse<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> before realizing that I had nowhere to go with the lyrics.</p>
<p>Finally, I got a verse and chord progression that sounded nice and left me room to grow.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Now all I need is another verse, a chorus, and a second set of verses. Easy.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>Like I’ve mentioned before, I<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> compose. And, today on the bus I was playing with the ukulele.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Someone asked me to sing a song about them, so I tried to make one up.</p>
<p>I thought it was ok, until someone yelled that it needed to rhyme. I then learned that I can’t think of rhymes when put under pressure.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> But, right as the ride ended, my creative flow kicked in. That meant that my head started thinking of music.</p>
<p>And, since everyone loves a good country song,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> my mind started thinking of country music. But, I can’t write a <em>normal</em> country song. Despite living in what the Census defines as a “rural” area, I didn’t have the experiences that a country song tends to need. I didn’t have a dog that I loved and lost, or a heartbreak, or an unhealthy relationship with alcohol or a car. To rebut the comment about singing anyways, I can’t be that fake. My high school friends would find out.</p>
<p>So, about one couplet<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> into each set of lyrics, I’d get stuck. Finally, I got a whole verse out. Now I’m stuck. But, I figured out the melody,<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> which is good because I tend to forget melodies. So, I’ve got four lines, a melody, and a chord progression. If I can just get four more lines and a chorus, I’m cooking.</p>
