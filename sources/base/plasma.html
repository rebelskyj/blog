<p>Today I updated my <a href="twenty-four.html">twenty four for twenty four goal</a><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, which feels like as good of a reason to restart this blog as any. On an impulse, I copied <a href="rolls.html">an old blog post</a>, because I was intrigued by what the title meant. Interestingly, while discussing the definitions of <a href="roll">i</a>n my life, I didn’t discuss the diving/gymnastics centered meaning of the word.</p>
<p>Anyways, one experiment that I was given to rebuild as a part of my PhD progress has the goal of creating a standing plasma. Last week I successfully produced a plasma for the first time in the instrument in over half a decade, which is incredible to me. Now I need to optimize the plasma and make it usable for what we need.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
