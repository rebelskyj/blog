<p>Today was<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> the annual 10/10 celebration at Grinnell College. It’s weird being further away from it than I ever have been before. Apparently in years past, students in my program would host an event for the Grinnell students in Europe. That didn’t happen this year. I wonder if that’s another 10/10 tradition that’s gone forever.</p>
