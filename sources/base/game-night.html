<p>Interestingly enough, <a href="writers-block-5.html">one day ago today</a> I sat in front of my computer without any idea what I would blog about. Today I have a slightly different issue. I am going to play games with friends tonight,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and had<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> every intention of musing about that experience. However, as I may have mentioned before,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> I‚Äôve started writing on a website which I find very helpful for getting me to write often and well. One feature of the site is that it sets semi-arbitrary goals for me to hit with regards to word count and pace.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, though the overlap is close, it does not always align perfectly with the number of words that I have left to write in a chapter of my web novel. In this case, I finished a longer than standard chapter with 200 or so words in my arbitrary goal.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut wait,‚Äù I hear you<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> ask, ‚Äúwhy not simply let those remaining words go to waste? Or, even better, why not simply start another chapter?‚Äù</p>
<p>To that, I reply,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> ‚ÄúI hate losing progress for work that I‚Äôve begun, and I need a blog post more than I need another chapter of my book at this exact moment.‚Äù</p>
<p>Now that I‚Äôve addressed the concerns, I can start writing about the game night I went to tonight. It was a good time! I got to spend time with friends, and I got to play a fun game of chance and skill!<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write 1700 words for NaNoWriMo? Once again, I managed a 2000 word hour with a friend, and did my writing for the day.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb? I did! I finished it and sent it to my beta reader hours before this post. Once again, it felt even easier today than yesterday.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? As you can see, we are now on day four of the streak.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? I did! This morning no less.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing better at prayer than a rushed and thoughtless rosary? Once again, I did the Angelus. Last night‚Äôs rosary was pretty rushed.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing a good job writing letters to friends? I got a friend‚Äôs address, which is technically progress in writing letters. Tomorrow I should actually write a letter, though.</p></li>
</ul>
