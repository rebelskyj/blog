<p>As those of you who’ve been following the progress of the baking competition might know, I’ve been working hard to perfect my recipe. Now that I’m at the training trip, I thought it important to try making the recipe here, as the oven and stove might behave differently. Oddly enough, the butter seems to behave differently, though that may just be my failure to cook.</p>
<p>I’ve learned that if you boil butter, it will eventually incorporate a lot of air. If you wait until that point to fold in chocolate, you end up with a more stable final project. It received positive reviews from all, including my alleged competition.</p>
<p>For the sake of not trying to remember, below is the recipe.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Combine 1 egg, 1 egg yolk, 2 tablespoons and 2 teaspoons sugar, and 1 tablespoon flour in a bowl.</p></li>
<li><p>Mix until fully incorporated</p></li>
<li><p>Grease a cupcake tin and wipe<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Melt 1/2 stick butter in pan, stirring often</p></li>
<li><p>When butter has boiled and begins to rapidly expand in size, remove from heat</p></li>
<li><p>Stir in 2.7 oz bittersweet chocolate pieces, and when fully mixed, add the egg mixture.</p></li>
<li><p>Once fully incorporated together, pour into muffin tin and cook at 350 F.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove from oven when the sides have begun to pull away and feel mostly solid when touched.</p></li>
<li><p>While still warm, flip onto plate to remove from trays.</p></li>
</ol>
