<p>Fifth Species counterpoint is fun! I like writing melodies, and I realize how much I love suspensions. Maybe in part because of the way the system is set up,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I use them a lot. Anyways, despite<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> missing two days this week, I still feel ready to move on to First Species with Three Voices. Exciting wow. Rules</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Only Whole notes</p></li>
<li><p>Consonance is defined against the lowest pitch</p></li>
<li><p>Upper two voices allow consonances, P4, tritone</p></li>
<li><p>Try to have mostly triad voicing</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Woo! Let’s have some fun.</p>
