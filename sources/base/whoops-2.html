<p>Last week I said that I would be using today’s post to write about Chapter One of a book. But, I forgot it at work when I went home for the day, so no post today. Apparently <a href="whoops.html">last time</a> a whoops moment was the focus of the blog I deleted something. At least this isn’t that!</p>
