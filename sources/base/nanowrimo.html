<p>As many of you know, today is All Saints Day. Coincidentally, that means that today is also the first of November. Now, in addition to being the month dedicated to a focus on menâ€™s<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> mental health, November is also NaNoWriMo.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> And, since I lack most of the time consuming activities I have at Grinnell,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> I have more free time here. So, I decided Iâ€™d try to write 50,000 additional words this month, or around 1700 a day. Now, according to my quick and dirty approximation, Iâ€™ve written approximately 750 words a day for these posts.</p>
<p>Thatâ€™s a shame. I guess that Iâ€™m going to have to triple my daily word count, since this isnâ€™t an excuse for me to stop posting, and I donâ€™t want to subject others to the horror of my attempts at creative writing.</p>
