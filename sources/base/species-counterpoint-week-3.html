<p>Fourth Species counterpoint remains kind of strange, if only because most of the canti firmi<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I write have mainly stepwise motion, meaning that you end up with a lot of chained suspensions. I personally love chained suspensions, so that’s fine with me, but I understand why others don’t.</p>
<p>However, after a nice week of this, I feel ready for Fifth Species. Fifth Species combines all the rules of the other species together kind of.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>quarter, half, and whole notes are allowed</p></li>
<li><p>dissonances resolve stepwise</p></li>
<li><p>dissonances allowed on the downbeat only when suspended</p></li>
<li><p>should be singable and pretty</p></li>
</ul>
<p>After this, I start with three voice species counterpoint, which I’ll need to look up the rules for.</p>
