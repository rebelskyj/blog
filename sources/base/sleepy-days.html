<h1 id="sleep-days"><a href="sleepy-days.html">Sleep Days</a></h1>
<p>Some days you go to sleep, anxiously awaiting the coming morning and day. Other days you wake up, counting down the moments until you can go back to sleep.</p>
<p>There are many factors that can influence both of those, from what’s happening in your life at a macro scale,<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> at a micro scale,<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, and how much sleep you’ve gotten the night<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> before.</p>
<p>Today I remembered that sleep you miss is at least as important as the other two. I didn’t sleep enough, and so today wasn’t as fully experienced as it could be. I’m hoping tomorrow will be better.</p>
