<p>First, apparently I never published my <a href="writers-block-4.html">last writer’s block post</a>, and instead linked to an older one. Wild.</p>
<p>Anyways, for whatever reason, I can’t think of what to blog about today. I’ve written over 2000 words of my novel, which is nice, and this is my last activity with my computer before I write my poem of the day.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I guess I could talk about how those are going.</p>
<p>The novel is going interestingly, because it’s not something that I did even the slightest bit of planning about. More or less, the impetus for the novel was a few vignettes that I’d been thinking about, which had no temporal connection. As a result, writing them results in something very much the same.</p>
<p>In the poem, I wrote a meta-poem villanelle the first day and a sonnet the second. Today I’m going to try a free poem, but who knows how well that will go. Huh, just like that, I’m at over 150 words.</p>
