<p>As someone who does a lot of math-adjacent work<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, I often have to do lots of repetitive calculations. Since I am easily bored, I tried to find a way to not have to do the same equation 100 times with only minor modifications. Growing up in a CS heavy household, I realized that I could try to use computers to do some of the math for me.</p>
<p>So, I asked my family “What language should I learn?” They responded<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Python, because lots of reasons which boil down to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It’s easy</p></li>
<li><p>It’s commonly used</p></li>
</ul>
<p>But as I worked in Python, I became dissatisfied.</p>
<p>Anyways, flash forward to today where I’m now learning Racket. Racket is built on Scheme which is built on Lisp. Lisp is a language<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> that developed in parallel to C<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>-like languages, which is based on the idea of lambda calculus.</p>
<p>It uses a lot of parentheses, and it has been fun to figure out how to use it. Today I wanted to see if 12 steps to the octave really is the best approximation<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>. Turns out it is in fact the best up to 47 divisions of the octave! And I did that in Racket, which is fun and exciting. If you want my<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> code, feel free to message me.</p>
