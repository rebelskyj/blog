<p>Isaiah 53:11 “Because of his affliction he shall see the light in fullness of days; Through his suffering, my servant shall justify many, and their guilt he shall bear.”</p>
<p>Today is the 29 Sunday of Ordinary Time in Year B.</p>
<p>Today’s first reading speaks about how someone will bear the sins and burdens for others. In doing so, he will “justify many.”</p>
<p>I don’t know why, but I really appreciate the imagery in the first reading.</p>
