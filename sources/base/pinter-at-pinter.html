<p>Today, I had the wonderful fortune of watching “Pinter at the Pinter,” a series of Pinter shows at the Harold Pinter Theatre. It was confusing. Apparently I don’t really understand absurdism. But, such is life.</p>
<p>The stage was fantastic, and spun. The lighting was minimal, but well executed. The ukulele playing was mediocre, which was sad. All of the other sounds were beautifully done, whether as subtle or blatant effect</p>
