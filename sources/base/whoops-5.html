<p>So on the bright side, I’ve now figured out at least one reason why I sometimes stop blogging/composing/everything else I value doing. When I miss out on sleep, I not only feel tired, I just generally fail to accomplish most of what I’d like to do. Moving forward, I guess this means I need to start prioritizing sleep more. C’est la vie.</p>
