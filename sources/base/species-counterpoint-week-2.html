<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>It’s the last day of the year, which <a href="ending-18.html">last time I wrote on</a>, I focused on the last year. I hadn’t taken to more formal reflections then, which I think I will do on the second.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Instead, I’m going to treat today as a<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> standard Saturday post, and talk about me week in species counterpoint.</p>
<p>Once again, I managed to do the counterpoint every day. Like last week, I again decided to switch on Wednesday, this time from second to third species. I think I’ve gotten the hang of third species well enough that next week I’m going to start on fourth species.</p>
<p>I can definitely feel my composition chops getting better. As I remarked to a friend, I felt like I was at the cusp of conscious incompetence and competence. Now I feel like I’m well into the conscious competence, and edging into the unconscious competence again. The lines I’m writing generally meet all the rules of species counterpoints, and I’m starting to see more or less accidental motifs arising, as well as better general contouring in the line.</p>
<p>Once again, I’m excited to see how well it transfers.</p>
