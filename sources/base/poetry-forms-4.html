<p>Two weeks later I have written no more poems. It’s a really sad thing for me to realize: I love when I write poems but I don’t make time for it. I’m not sure what stops me from making time, especially with how much I waste, but I’m not sure how to encourage myself to write more. Anyways, here’s a fun<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> double acrostic again.</p>
<p>Try Again<br />
Take heed of everything you’re not<br />
Repeat so to remember<br />
Yet never heed your fancy<br />
Attempting once again may let a<br />
Grain or some small egg<br />
Attach itself or grow an anima<br />
Instead of ever rising ennui<br />
Nature’s choice for to assign<br />
Well that was really rough. I’m unsure if it’s a reflection on the time I’m writing it, my general mental capacity, the time between poems, or just the words I chose, but I’m not at all happy with this poem. Maybe I’ll edit it tomorrow.</p>
