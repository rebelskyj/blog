<p>Last night<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> I had the chance to watch a fantastic musical called “Come From Away.” It’s about the small Newfoundland town that suddenly nearly doubled in town on September 11, 2001 when planes were diverted to its airport. I really enjoyed the musical, because most of the music was clearly coming from the Newfoundland folk tradition, and there were certainly<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> a number of nods to that great Canadian songsmith Stan Rogers, with his driving bass and rock influences.</p>
<p>The musical was interesting, especially in the way that it interspersed the serious with the profound with the funny and lighthearted. It gave me, at least, a similar feeling to what it must have felt like to be running without sleep for days in the midst of tragedy and love.</p>
<p>The mix wasn’t the best, but that could also just be where we were sitting. It was a fantastic show!</p>
