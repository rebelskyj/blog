<p>I find that my life runs better when it’s more heavily scheduled. Often, this means that I have activities planned for particular times, but it’s more than that. Lately I’ve been running into a fair number of friends who I realize I’ve lost contact with in the past few months, not through any malice on either of our ends, but simply because it’s easy to forget people in graduate school.</p>
<p>I don’t want to forget the people who mean a lot to me, so I need to figure out a way to get into the habit of messaging people I care about. I was recently having a conversation with someone where I mentioned that I’ve been called really considerate before because I had written down a reminder, and then remembered the event from it. I don’t think of that as particularly speaking to my care/memory, because it was just me sending a note into the aether, where it eventually came back to me. The person I was talking to is in the camp of extended memory as memory<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, and so assured me that not having the memory to remember important things wasn’t important, especially since I had a system to figure it out.</p>
<p>Still, though, I know that I have systems which work. I really just need to use them. Maybe I should just set a reminder to text people every few weeks.</p>

<li id="fn1" role="doc-endnote"><p>if you don’t know what this means, the tl;dr is basically research shows that when we read something we often remember where we read it, rather than what we read, because that’s more efficient.
