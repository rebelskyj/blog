<p>Woo! Another month passed. It hardly feels real that it’s been a month, but what a month it’s been.</p>
<p>I gave <a href="universe-2.html">three</a> <a href="universe-3.html">talks</a> in state parks, signed up for another four(?), and very recently was reached out to for another two talks this fall about the eclipse! I went to a <a href="conference-2.html">conference</a>. I went to a <a href="mission-trip.html">mission trip</a>. I rediscovered my love of pinball.</p>
<p>I finished the first book in my web serial. I finished the first batch of lemon wine for the summer!<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Last night, I made it back to an open mic for the first time in a while.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>So: looking back at my goals.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Make my home clean again and invite a friend over. I have actual time in it this month, so that should be easier.</p>
<p>I don’t know why I thought I was actually at home this past month. By the 19th I had spent a total of four nights in it. It was a packed month. Home is cleaner, though still too cluttered.</p></li>
<li><p>Continue blogging/find a way to do it during my conference. I know I won’t have time for it next Thursday, because I’m volunteering.</p>
<p>I did not blog anywhere near as much as I would have liked to, but I did at least get seven in last month. That’s more than half of June.</p></li>
<li><p>I’d like to exercise more. Ideally daily, but</p>
<p>I exercised nowhere near as much as I in theory want, for all that I don’t feel like I was particularly sedentary. I am far stiffer now than ever before in my life, though, so morning stretching might need to return at a minimum.</p></li>
<li><p>Once again, I’d like to develop a sleep schedule that gives me enough and gets me up early (6am)</p>
<p>Sleep schedule was generally pretty 6am centric. I don’t think all of the breaks were my fault.</p></li>
<li><p>I’d like to make more time for prayer, or at least be more intentional about my prayer</p>
<p>Prayer was not as intentional as I would’ve liked, but it’s a journey.</p></li>
<li><p>I absolutely need to get five chapters ahead, if only because I want to start monetizing.</p>
<p>I am just under four chapters ahead right now. That’s better than nothing.</p></li>
<li><p>Doing some sort of poetry each day seems like a doable goal, if not a low bar.</p>
<p>I wrote maybe three poems.</p></li>
<li><p>I would like to get through my stack of letters<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>I think I’m through every letter I meant to write at the start of July. My list is now only five long.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This upcoming month I’m excited for:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>My birthday!</p></li>
<li><p>Giving five talks in state parks</p></li>
<li><p>Sharing lemon wine with friends</p></li>
<li><p>Finishing my stack of letters<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Starting to do open mics regularly again</p></li>
<li><p>Staying up on all of my book clubs</p></li>
<li><p>Making progress on research</p></li>
<li><p>Monetizing my story?<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Using last month’s goals and the excitement as a way to generate a list of goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Finish my presentation on the Pleiades.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Make my home clean again. It was at the start of the summer, so I know it’s possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Blog more. Last month I wrote 12 percent less<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> than in June, which I think is mostly a lack of blogs.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch daily? I think that would be good for me and probably doable. I’ll need to stretch after this, which is less than ideal since it’s already past my bed time, but eh.</p></li>
<li><p>Sleep enough and have a sleep schedule based around waking up no later than 6<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Be more intentional about prayer. I think one thing that could help is making an actual commitment to doing a rosary at the chapel before work every day, on the road days that I’m not in Madison, before Mass on Sundays, and during a walk on Saturdays. That’s at least a little bit I can do, though today it will have to come after stretching.</p></li>
<li><p>Get further ahead on the book. In particular, I’d like to set the goal of more than four chapters a week.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> That seems both very doable<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> and helpful to me.</p></li>
<li><p>Write poetry every day. I need to remind myself that I like the way I am more when I do more poetry. I do, so hopefully this works.</p></li>
<li><p>Finish stack of letters, and maybe think of more people to write to? Otherwise, start journaling during my morning time?</p></li>
<li><p>Write a song. I loved premiering my new song last night, and want to do that more.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So, my daily reflections will look like:<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I work on presentations?<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Did I make progress against entropy in my home?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog today/yesterday, depending on when written?<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Did I write book today? How many chapters am I at this week /4+?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write poetry today/yesterday, depending on when written?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a letter/journal today?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I work on a new song?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I prioritize sleep?<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Did I pray the rosary? Was it intentional? Did I prioritize other prayer today as well?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As an example:<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Didn’t do much work, honestly.</p></li>
<li><p>Slight progress against entropy.</p></li>
<li><p>Blogged today, forgot yesterday/got home well past bed time and fought my keg.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Wrote about half a chapter today .9/4+</p></li>
<li><p>Will write a poem after this</p></li>
<li><p>I did not write a letter or journal today.</p></li>
<li><p>I did not work on a song.</p></li>
<li><p>I will stretch.</p></li>
<li><p>I tried to prioritize sleep today, though I’m not by writing a poem and stretching after this.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I do not think I’ll be awake through a rosary today.</p></li>
</ul>
