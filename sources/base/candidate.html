<p>In the time since I stopped writing this blog, there have been a number of changes in my life.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> One of the most notable of which is that I am now a PhD candidate. I haven’t quite figured out how that changes my own life, but I understand that it generally comes with a few changes in a PhD student’s life.</p>
<p>It often means that you’re beginning work on your thesis. In theory I’ve been working on that for a while.</p>
<p>It often means that you’re done with classes, but I’ve been done needing classes for more than a year and done taking classes for a semester or so.</p>
<p>It often means that your PhD project has been approved, but at least in my program, we never actually get a formal approval for our PhD project from our committee.</p>
<p>Where does that leave me? More or less in the same place, except that I’ve changed my LinkedIn profile to say “PhD Candidate” instead of “PhD Student.” As I write this, I’ve already found a second use case for that! Someone asked me to write a bio for the public talks I’ll be giving again this summer.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
