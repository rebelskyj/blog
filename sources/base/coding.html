<p>I’m currently working on an exam for my degree. The exam consists of planning an experiment<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> which would last around two years. As part of preparation for that exam, I have been trying to write some code to see if it the project is even doable.</p>
<p>In doing so, I’m learning just how much I don’t really understand code. I’m lucky enough to be home and with my two brothers and fathers, all of whom are significantly better than me at coding. However, it’s really heartening seeing how much more I can follow each time that I do another coding project.</p>
