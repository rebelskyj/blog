<p>My role model for this writing<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> reflect each month on the month, especially in relation to writing. This month for writing was interesting.</p>
<p>I failed to write the most days I’ve ever done. Conversely, I still have an average of one post a day.</p>
<p>I also set a goal of writing a sonnet every day. While I did not quite reach the goal, I did write<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> 24 sonnets, which is good enough for me. I learned that I can write about the everyday events in my life, which is nice.</p>
<p>Next month, I will try to write the posts more consistently for their day. I will also try to write a limerick a day, as that should hopefully be less time consuming.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
