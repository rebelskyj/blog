<p>Like my <a href="open-mic.html">last post on the topic</a>, I missed writing and uploading a post last night because I was at an open mic. Unlike last time, though, I was performing at this one. A friend from my graduate program and I have played at this open mic twice now, and it was a great time.</p>
<p>The vibes are really nice at the place. The crowd is generally supportive but not hyperfocused on the music.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The other performers were almost universally better than me, but incredibly supportive.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> So yeah! I’m excited to keep going.</p>
