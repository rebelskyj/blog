<p>Christmas Eve has always been a weird day to me. Mostly, this is because I accept that<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> days start and end at sunset. That’s the reason for Vigil Masses and such. However, Eve means <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&amp;search=eve">the evening before.</a> So, the idea of Christmas Eve just seems weird to me. The evening before Christmas is technically the 23.</p>
