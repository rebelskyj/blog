<p>Today, I went on a riverwalk. Nominally, it was to fulfill an academic assignment. Since the assignment was vague,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> I chose to journey between the London Aquatics Centre<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and the River Thames.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> I found that <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> you can walk the entire distance from the Aquatic Centre to the Thames entirely along different rivers and streams.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> I had a great time during the walk! A part of me really wanted to go all the way to the English Chanel, but I knew that was a poor choice. For one, it would have been far longer than a 90 minute walk. Second, it’s really hard to decide where a tributary ends and where the real river<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> ends. Finally, the footpath that would have let me walk along the Thames was closed. Nonetheless, it was a great time. If you want to see my journey at 60x speed,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> you can find it <a href="https://vimeo.com/288755224">here</a>. If you want to see it at 15x speed,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> along with fun information, you can find it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1j-zlVfoHo">here</a>.</p>

<p>Today for a homework assignment, I went on a riverwalk.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> I chose to go from the London Aquatics Center<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> to the River Thames.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> I found that you can go the entire distance from the Aquatic Centre to the Thames without ever leaving the river.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> It was a really fun walk. It was tempting to walk to where the Thames meets the Chanel, but I was unable to for two reasons: that would have put me well over the maximum time of 90 minutes, and the footpath following the Thames was closed.</p>
