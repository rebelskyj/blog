<p>Yesterday I gave the <a href="talk-planning-1.html">talk</a> <a href="talk-planning-2.html">that</a> <a href="talk-planning-3.html">I’ve</a> <a href="talk-planning-4.html">been</a> talking about for a while. I think it went well, and I got mostly positive feedback. It’s very weird to be over it though, I feel like I didn’t do anywhere as good of a job as I wanted, and I only read like half of what I was planning to read.</p>
<p>Still, it happened!</p>
