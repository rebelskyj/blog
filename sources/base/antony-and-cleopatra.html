<p>Tofay I had the wonderful opportunity to see <em>Antony and Cleopatra</em> as performed at the National Theatre. It was really well-staged and lit. The sounds were amazing, with one exception.</p>
<p>In the script, it calls for the predecessor of the oboe and bassoon to be playing, as itâ€™s an eerie sound. Instrad, the show chose to use cello. It was certainly a different effect, and not one that I personally was a fan of. But, overall, the sounds were fantastic.</p>
<p>The show was a modern adaptation, and was skillfully executed. The stage continually amazed me, and was hard for me to even comprehend how it some of the changes might be done.</p>
