<p>Some times in my life I really think of as listening times. On some occasions that means hearing a friend as they share something deep and personal in their life. At others, it means hearing a story or tale as it weaves. Still others are when I get to sit in silence and hear my own thoughts as they interplay with the natural<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> noises around me. And finally, sometimes I get to listen to intentional music.</p>
<p>Tonight is one of those nights. I was reminded of a fantastic curated playlist that an amazing person made for me, and got to listen to it. There were no familiar songs on it, and only a few familiar artists, which made the experience fantastic. Much like me, the playlist generator used so many genres and styles, which gave a very nice experience</p>
