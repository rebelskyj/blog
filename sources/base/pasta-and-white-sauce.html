<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Since coming to London, I’ve been trying new and exciting recipes.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> One of these, the focus of tonight’s post, is pasta in white sauce. There are a few reasons for this.</p>
<p>First, I like pasta. It’s a good comfort food and it’s hard to make badly. Second, I like milk based products. Third, I like being able to pretend I made something, more than just dumping something into a pot.</p>
<p>So, the recipe:</p>
<p>Ingredients:<br />
Pasta<br />
Butter<br />
Cheese<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a><br />
Flour<br />
Milk<br />
Salt</p>
<p>To Make Sauce:<br />
Put approximately equal portions of butter and flour in a pan over medium to low heat.<br />
Mix until it begins to brown.<br />
Add milk and cheese.<br />
Stir, adding more milk as needed.<br />
Add salt to taste.<br />
To Make Pasta:<br />
Salt water.<br />
Cook Pasta.<br />
Drain Pasta.<br />
Put Pasta in Sauce.<br />
Serve.<br />
