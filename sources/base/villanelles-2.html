<p>Well, I have once again fallen behind on both poems and writing blog posts.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> There’s a Tumblr page that posts weekly prompts for short writings, and last Friday I responded to it with a poem. I kind of like the idea of continuing to do that, and sonnet form is starting to get boring to me.</p>
<p>So, it feels like a good time to break back out villanelles. I’ve written about them <a href="on-villanelles.html">before</a>, but they remain a fascinating poetic form to me, for all that they’re significantly harder to write.</p>
