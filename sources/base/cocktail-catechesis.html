<p>Tonight I went to my first cocktails and catechesis in a while. More or less, it’s a happy half hour followed by around an hour of discussion about the content in the past few weeks of the CCCiaY. This week’s topic was Baptism and Confirmation.</p>
<p>It was a great time, though more sparsely attended than I remember. Between that and leaving work late, though, I didn’t end up doing the writing I wanted to today.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I made arguably negative progress.</p></li>
<li><p>Blogging streak day four! wow!</p></li>
<li><p>Air quality got somehow even worse, so I took another day off of exercise. I did walk a friend home, though, so I’m counting that</p></li>
<li><p>I got up at six! Wow! Starting a streak just in time to end it.</p></li>
<li><p>I listened to a lot of CCCiaY today. Once more, bedtime rosary is the plan</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote none chapters today.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> I’m still two ahead, though, which is really nice.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Two days of no sonnets</p></li>
<li><p>Two days of no letters. I think tomorrow morning is a great time to write one though.</p></li>
</ul>
