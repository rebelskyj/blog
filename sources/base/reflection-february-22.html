<p>New monthly reflection!</p>
<p>My goals were:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Blog daily</p></li>
<li><p>Compose a poem and music daily</p></li>
<li><p>Do the pushup/squat thing daily</p></li>
<li><p>Listen to BiaY Daily</p></li>
<li><p>Track my daily doings better in my journal</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I think I made a blog every day which was great. I composed maybe five or ten days, which is still progress I think. I gave up on the pushup/squats, but I restarted yesterday! I listened maybe half the days in BiaY. I think I just entirely gave up on the journal.</p>
<p>So, apparently bad goals. New goals for the month of March:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Blog daily. I think this is still a helpful thing for me to do</p></li>
<li><p>Write music or poetry daily. I would like to do this, even if it is hard</p></li>
<li><p>Do the pushup/squat thing and stretch daily. I liked how I felt when I did this</p></li>
<li><p>Listen to BiaY Daily. I like making progress on it.</p></li>
<li><p>Reach 50000 words in my book. Iâ€™m currently at more than 20K, so this should be very doable.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>That seems pretty decent!</p>
