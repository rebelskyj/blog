<p>Tonight I had the wonderful opportunity to see <em>La Bayadere</em> at the Royal Opera House.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> It was odd.</p>
<p>Apparently in ballet, unlike theatre, youâ€™re supposed to read whatâ€™s going to happen ahead of time. I did not. I was confused.</p>
<p>I did like the second act, though. There were a couple of dances with the whole chorus that were super fun and made nice lines and shapes.</p>
<p>Overall, while not a fan of opera, at least I have another piece in the music to theatrical story spectrum. It begins with symphony, then sound painting, then ballet, opera, musical, then non musical theatre. Yay.</p>
