<p>I’ve been a little lackluster in my postings lately. There’s probably a variety of reasons for that, but there’s one big one that I think is very relevant.</p>
<p>When I started writing the blog back in 2019, I really enjoyed being able to tell my friends and family what I was up to every day, and it helped me complete an assignment for class. When I restarted this January, I found that it was really nice to help me reflect on my day or something else, and it encouraged me to work better. Both of these share something vital, though, that I feel like is missing now. It was fun when I started.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, writing this blog isn’t really making my heart sing like it used to. This week hasn’t been great for me for a lot of reasons, so I’m really hoping that it’s just that, and not the blog itself. Still, my life is busy enough without adding obstacles that don’t bring me joy.</p>
<p>So, I’m planning to stop posting every day, at least for now. I’ll still try to keep up my weekly reflections on the Gospel, and I definitely plan to keep using this blog as a way for me to take notes on the books I read and media I consume, but I don’t know if I’ll make posts every day.</p>
<p>Anyways, thanks to all of you for reading thus far, and sorry if these were something you looked forward to. I hope to get to a point again where writing every day brings me joy again.</p>
