<p>Another month, another monthly reflection.</p>
<p>My goals were:<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Blog daily. Eventually this goal will happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch daily. I’m going to stretch right after this, just so I make sure to do it.</p></li>
<li><p>Figure out how to repair/improve my accordion case. I made some notes today, and I think I should be able to get some of it done by the end of the month.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a poem every day. I did feel like the poems I wrote helped me ease into sleep, and they certainly help me write songs better.</p></li>
<li><p>Finish the newest song I’m working on.</p></li>
<li><p>Make progress on catching up for BiaY.</p></li>
<li><p>Fill in at least 3 more items on my 24 for 24.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>How’d we do?</p>
<ol>
<li><p>17/31 blogs. That’s more than half, so improvement.</p></li>
<li><p>I had about a week where I stretched, so that didn’t go horribly.</p></li>
<li><p>Turns out repair was as simple as taping it back together, so I gave up on that project.</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote a couple of poems, rough estimate of 12, so could do better.</p></li>
<li><p>I not only finished it, I’ve performed it!</p></li>
<li><p>Lots of progress, I’m now at day 232.</p></li>
<li><p>I added two new points, so I’m on schedule if not my goal</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In the next month I’m going to try:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Blog every day. I believe in this month.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch every day.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a poem every day. I’m doing a poem a day with some friends, so I’m accountable there.</p></li>
<li><p>Finish NaNoWriMo successfully</p></li>
<li><p>Make progress towards catching up on BiaY</p></li>
<li><p>At least two entries in 24<span class="math inline"><sup>2</sup></span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s see how we do!</p>
<p>Outside of my goals, I had a pretty good month. I’m making new friends and deepening existing relationships, which is always nice.</p>
