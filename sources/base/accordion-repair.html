<p>I mentioned <a href="twenty-four.html">recently</a> that I learned how to repair an accordion. I don’t know if I’ve mentioned here yet that I own an accordion, but I do.</p>
<p>More or less, one row of the bass reeds had fallen into the bellows of my instrument.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Now that I know how to, fixing it is as simple as opening the bass side up by removing six pins and slotting the row back into place. However, I did not know that at the time, and ended up spending around two hours to get to that point of knowledge. I’m glad for the mistakes I made, because they’ll help me do better in the future!</p>
