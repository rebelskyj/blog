<p>So, you know, I kind of fell off writing this again. In my defense, I did write just under 80,000 words last month, so most of my mental energy was occupied elsewhere. In <a href="reflection-april-2022.html">last year’s</a> version of this post, I set the goals of blogging, poetry, and stretching daily. I also, humorously enough, set the goal of finishing the first draft of the book that I’m now putting out as a web novel.</p>
<p>My goals for the month come in a few shapes.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Professional:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start running my first instrument. I have a conference in about a month and a half, and I really need to start collecting data.</p></li>
<li><p>Finish building the second instrument. More or less as above.</p></li>
<li><p>Finish TA’ing for the semester. There isn’t too much to this goal, since I just need to grade a few items.</p></li>
<li><p>Prepare for a talk at a state park. I can recycle most of my content from last year.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Personal:</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Welp, that’s certainly a lot. Hopefully I manage to do at least most of these most of the time!</p>
<p>Generally, it looks like my professional goals are all deadline based, which makes some amount of sense. My personal goals are generally musical, which is interesting. My growth goals seem to focus on fitness and putting out writing. No real commentary there.</p>
<p>Anyways, hopefully see you<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> tomorrow!</p>
