<p>I really thought that I had a monthly tradition of reflecting on the past month. Looking through my history, however, I apparently only did this <a href="reflection-january-19">once</a>, which makes it somewhat funny that it was also a January reflection.</p>
<p>Since I set yearly goals, now seems like a good time to check in on them.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Huh, I guess I didn’t really write my goals on the blog, did I. Welp, I guess let me look based on the goals I wrote down elsewhere.</p>
<p>I have a goal of blogging every day, I made it 28<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> days out of 31, which is pretty good. I’d like to do better next month, which might require more planning ahead.</p>
<p>I have a goal of writing a poem every day, I think I succeeded twice. I might want to switch to an easier format than villanelles, maybe sonnets again, just to get back into it.</p>
<p>I have a goal of working out more. I’ve been doing better on that regard, especially since I shifted from shooting for 30 minute workouts, which I cannot find the energy to do, into doing an additive thing. Basically, every day I do one more pushup and squat. I started on the 11th, so I do the number of days this year minus ten to see how many I should do each day. I still haven’t been great at keeping up with it, but hopefully next month will be better.</p>
<p>I’ve on average been good with Bible in a Year, though I’ve had to double up a few days. I’d like to do better at that.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to next month, I think my goals will be:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Blog daily</p></li>
<li><p>Compose a poem and music daily</p></li>
<li><p>Do the pushup/squat thing daily</p></li>
<li><p>Listen to BiaY Daily</p></li>
<li><p>Track my daily doings better in my journal</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I guess I’ll probably check in four weeks from now, to see how I did.</p>
<p>I do like that I’ve managed to add blogging back into my daily routine fairly easily, especially since I haven’t found that it correlates too much with extra screen time<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. I still haven’t found my right place for poetry. Historically I would write them before bed I think, but I’m far too tired for that most nights. Who knows, though, maybe taking those extra few minutes would serve me really well. I guess that’s something I can work towards in February<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>My last post that was written the day it posted was on <a href="diving-15-feb.html">February 15</a>, and it was incredibly short. My last post is dated <a href="still-behind.html">February 22</a> and was written March 3. The last post I’m willing to claim as a fullish post is my reflection on the <a href="reflections-on-readings-6-ordinary-c.html">Sixth Week of Ordinary Time</a>, which was February 17 in 2019.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> It’s weird to me that in a few weeks, between less than two and five, depending on which standard I’m using, I will officially be past anything I’ve written before. The last post that was full and not backdated is the week before’s <a href="reflections-on-readings-5-ordinary-c.html">Reflection on the Gospel</a>, which was the 10 of February. It’s a somewhat scary and exciting feeling.</p>
