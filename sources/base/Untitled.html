<p>I can’t believe I deleted my draft again. Oh well, I only had the first draft, so it’s fine. I’m comparing use of music in 3 Shakespeare tragedies: Macbeth, Othello, and Antony and Cleopatra.</p>
<p>Macbeth: Flourishes called for five times: first time Duncan enters and leaves stage (1.4), when malcolm enters after macbeth dies (5.8), when macbeth head is brought out, and when he leaves to end the show. Hautboy (1.7) to signal the horrible thing happening at castle Macbeth. Hecate speaks in rhyme. Song: come away, come away. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mq/XLVII.1.22">this guy</a> claims that come away come away (all of hecate really) doesn’t count as Shakespeare, so we’ll ignore it. 4.1 has more hautboys, during the scene with witches and ghosts. Idk if that’s included in the not real bit, so I’ll assume it is since I don’t remember those lines from the performance.</p>
<p>1.3 calls for a drum- witches prepare for macbeth 5.2 calls for drum and colours- marching to kill mac 5.4 again drum and colours, same thing 5.5 drum and colours as macbeth preps for war 5.6 as macduff enters to kill beth 5.8, with flourish is drum and colour</p>
<p>Othello: <a href="https://www.shakespeare.org.uk/explore-shakespeare/blogs/shakespeares-drinking-songs/">canakin clink</a> (2.3) was likely a popular drinking song. <a href="http://www.lieder.net/lieder/get_text.html?TextId=18061">claims</a> original. <a href="http://www.lieder.net/lieder/get_text.html?TextId=31027">b</a>ased off of folk song (2.3) <a href="http://www.lieder.net/lieder/get_text.html?TextId=14898">poor</a> <a href="https://www.shakespeare.org.uk/explore-shakespeare/blogs/shakespeares-saddest-song/">soul</a> not Shakespeare original, but version by him 4.3 Iago noticing othello trumpet (2.1) “The Moor! I know his trumpet.” 3.1 cassio brings musicians, they get thrown away 5.2 emilia and willow song</p>
