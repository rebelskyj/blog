<p>As I mentioned <a href="nanowrimo.html">earlier</a>, Iâ€™m doin NaNoWriMo this year. But, Iâ€™m also competitive with myself. So, around four days in, I figured out how Iâ€™d challenge myself. Each day, Iâ€™ll not only write more,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> but also increase the rate with which Iâ€™m writing more. Since I didnâ€™t think ahead, that means that each day I need to write more than 3% more than I did the day before. So, by the end of the month, Iâ€™ll have around five thousand words to write a day.</p>
<p>On the bright side, if I can do it, Iâ€™ll have certainly made papers in the future much easier.</p>
