<p>Today, all three of the men attempted to end the meet with the same dive, 405C. One of us<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> has thrown the dive at numerous other meets, so it went well, as was to be expected. One of us<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> had never attempted this dive before, so it went better than expected. One of us<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> had tried it a few times before, so the dive went as mediocrely as to be expected.</p>
<p>In addition, I attempted 205 again. This time I tried it twice, the first was ok, the second one went way over! I almost threw a triple. That’s exciting.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the meet went pretty well. I had some dives I’ve never done quite as well, and a lot of dives I’ve done as well before.</p>
