<p>I’ve <a href="toffee-recipe.html">written before</a> about how I make toffee, but I made it again for the first time in a long while today, and that seemed appropriate to blog about here. As before, the recipe is 1:1 sugar and butter, heated to hot then cooled. This time, however, as I have <a href="candied-orange.html">too much chocolate</a>, I decided to make the toffee the way most of the internet suggests I should: chocolate covered. It came out well!</p>
<p>I guess it’s unsurprising that a recipe which<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> is just 1 part chocolate, sugar, and butter, could come out well. Nonetheless, it was really fun to see that I can, in fact, make things taste good. I unfortunately didn’t let my chocolate cool enough before mixing it into the cookie dough but that’s life I suppose, I’ll have moreso chocolate than chocolate chip cookie.</p>
