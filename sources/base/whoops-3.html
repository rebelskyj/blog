<p>Yesterday I fully intended to write a monthly reflection post, for all that it would be a full week late. Instead, through a series of coincidences, I found that I was without my computer and away from home until far too late to write a post.</p>
<p>The story for those interested will be below.</p>
<p>We had a small birthday celebration for a group mate, which I left to go to a Fish Fry at a local church with friends. While at the fish fry, I got to see another one of my group mates, who asked if I could come back to their home to help jump a car. From there, I went to go catch up with a friend, which ended up resulting in me also catching up with a few other friends. By the time I finally got to bed, it was well past one, but I felt very well socialized.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I will be posting my reflection, so I guess Iâ€™ll reflect on the month on Monday.</p>
