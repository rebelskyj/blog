<p>I talked about how I do better with doing things when they’re scheduled, and how I do better with schedules when I know what’s scheduled. With that in mind, it seems useful to plan out what I’ll practice on my instruments.</p>
<p>Much as I love accordion, it’s more of an ordeal to practice, so I find that I don’t do it as much, especially when I’m tired. So, on days when I lack energy, my practice will be playing through a song on guitar and doing a scale.</p>
<p>If I have mental energy again,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I would like to try to learn at least a song every two weeks.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> That way I can keep the open mics spiced up. I’d ideally like to do most of these on accordion.</p>
