<p>Tonight I saw the same version of Twelfth Night that I saw <a href="twelfth-night.html">just over five years ago.</a> Of course, the cast and location were completely different. I didn’t think that I remembered any part of the show, but every time I heard one of the<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> musical numbers, it was like I was transported back to my time in London. The sense of deja vu was almost overwhelming at times.</p>
<p>Much like my musings in those days, I find that it’s late enough I have nothing else to say. Tomorrow I’ll do a comparative review, but tonight I must sleep.</p>
