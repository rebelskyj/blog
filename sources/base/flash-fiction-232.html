<p>Another Friday, which means it’s time to try to answer another prompt. The prompt this week is among any option. I had no idea how to respond to this prompt, and reading the description didn’t make the prompt any more sensible. However, it did give me some ideas.</p>
<p>The prompt implies a choice. If we keep that in mind, then the prompt shifts to choosing between any option. What could be a good response for that prompt?</p>
<p>My mind is falling immediately to love, but I have to wonder how much of that is just me choosing a new creative rut. I think that the last few times that I’ve written a FFF, it’s been about romance of some sort. What else could we set as a number of choices?</p>
<p>I mean basically anything can be a set of choices, which makes this prompt feel almost too broad. I guess that more or less any writing I produce will be good for the prompt. A part of me really doesn’t like that, though, because part of my ideal for prompts is that it constrains my writing.</p>
<p>So, where else does my mind immediately go?</p>
<p>Given that we did a family recipe for dinner<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, I’m finding that I’m thinking about choosing foods. As the new Percy Jackson television series<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> is coming out, there’s choices about media we consume, hero’s choices, and the like. Since we play board games as a family, the idea of what game to play comes up a lot.</p>
<p>The hero’s choices feel like something that I want to interact with. What do heroes do? Or, rather, what terrible choice could a hero be forced into?<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>I’m still circling around the idea of romance, which may be something that I could do?</p>
<p>So, we have a hero<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> who needs to make a choice. Maybe there’s something to say about like deciding between the person you love and the work you need to do? Alright, how can we frame it in a way that hasn’t been done to death a million times?</p>
<p>Or, just as much in the choice, how do we do what we want to do with our full self, ignoring all the self doubt and negative self talk?</p>
<p>A hero has a choice. How explicit do I need to make that? I think that at this point I really need to focus on the writing, which means I need to stop writing about writing and start actually writing.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Actually, wait, let’s think about the normal questions we have. Do I want to have first or third person? I don’t really know. I think that we should write it and see what happens.</p>
<p>Ok so about five hundred words of writing later, I find that I got too far from the prompt. I more or less wrote a retrospective, ten years later. I think that I focused too much on the retrospective, rather than the actual set of choices. Maybe I could do something looking forwards instead?</p>
<p>Ooh, I actually really like the FFF I wrote. Let’s see if there’s anything I can do to spice it up for take three, but if not, I am actually going to be ok with it. I assume that I’ll see something that I want to change, but you never know until you try.</p>
<p>Ooh, wow, the revision is way stronger, I think. I more or less replaced every word, which is kind of funny when you think about it. The scene played out more or less the same, though, which is interesting. I do still feel like I rushed the ending, which is more and more something I realize I struggle with. The ending of a story always seems to come too quickly, and I don’t quite know how to wrap it<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> up satisfyingly.</p>
<p>All this to say, good night.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I embroider today? I need to find the embroidery, and more importantly, I need to find time for the embroidery. Picking a project would probably help too. There has to be someone I can give a small thing to, and I can just make something for one of them.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I play guitar today? I meant to, but the hours passed by really quickly. They were spent with family, though, so I cannot really complain.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I practice touch typing today? It’s too late, so I’m going to take a break for the day and say that’s ok.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Reading</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have I made progress on my Currently Reading Shelf? I’m still working on the third book in the series. I think that I’m spending too much time in front of screens, though, so should do some analog reading.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I read the book on craft? Brought it in finally today, but it was too dark to read.</p></li>
<li><p>Have I read the library books? I looked at them and felt bad that they were sitting alone, which is like reading them.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write a sonnet? Yesterday’s also wasn’t great, and I’m too tired to write one tonight. Tomorrow I should write earlier.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I revise a sonnet? Nope</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? Yay!</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write ahead on Jeb? I finished the final chapter of the year, and I’m going to intentionally take a few days off before starting again.</p></li>
<li><p>Letter to friends? I saw a few friends.</p></li>
<li><p>Paper? Nope</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Wellness</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How well did I pray? I should work on this</p></li>
<li><p>Did I spend my time well? Yeah!</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? Drat.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I exercise? Crud.</p></li>
<li><p>Water? Nope.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
