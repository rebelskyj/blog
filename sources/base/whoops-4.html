<p>How has it been almost two weeks since my last post? Intellectually it makes sense, but wow the passage of time is hard.</p>
<p>Anyways, I did finish the blanket which is exciting, and I’m again coming to the realization that when I stop exercising I also stop being productive. I haven’t been running or stretching really, which really puts a damper on my monthly goals. But, inspired by a friend making a book review blog, I think I might start reviewing books here.</p>
<p>Why, you<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> might ask, would I do that? At worst, I have a record of books I read and how I felt at the time. At best, I have a way to fill up days that I have nothing to write about. It should also help hold me accountable for not reading books that I don’t want to review.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Then again, I may not actually review everything I read.</p>
<p>Anyways, that’s all.</p>
