<p>Prereading note: There’s mentions of injury and blood, so if you don’t want to read about that, avoid today.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As some of you know, I’m somewhat<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> non-risk-averse.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> And, that often results in some fun stories.</p>
<p>My favorite stories are probably: the time I scalped myself,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> the time I set my hair on fire,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> the time I bled through fiberglass,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> and the time that I found out that all of the not brown<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> in my eye can fall to the bottom if I hit my eye correctly. Today, I get to have a new one! The time I broke my nose.</p>
<p>All things considered, it’s somewhat surprising to me that I’ve never broken it before. But, I was learning new skills today, and then misinterpreted a direction. I was on my hands, trying to learn a handstand forward roll, when I heard “go into a ball”. Now, I normally just pull my legs to my chest when I’m supposed to do that, so I did.</p>
<p>As you might expect, that threw me off balance. My knee came crashing down, and I heard a crunch. There was a lot of blood coming out.</p>
<p>But, small blessings still exist. I didn’t get any other injuries. Because of how I fell, my nose didn’t get bent out of place. I was surrounded by friends who helped me mop up the blood and start recovery.</p>
<p>But, I can now report on what a broken nose feels like.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> It felt almost entirely like an ice cream headache. My nose still hurts to touch, but that’s fine. Up at the bridge, it was really slidy, and I could move it from side to side and up and down.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Here’s hoping it heals well!</p>
