<p>Wow! A year ago two days from now I <a href="restarting-again">wrote</a> my last reflection on how I gave up on writing this blog. Unlike then, I do kind of regret this break. It wasn’t planned, it just sort of happened.</p>
<p>I have been keeping up on my <a href="creative-hobbies.html">creative</a> hobbies, another difference from last year. However, I do find that I still become ungrounded and disconnected without blogging.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>So, a few updates:<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I passed my candidacy exam!</p></li>
<li><p>I have kept writing the book that I talked about before giving up</p></li>
<li><p>I started a new book</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Anyways, hopefully I’ll be able to get back to doing this daily!<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
