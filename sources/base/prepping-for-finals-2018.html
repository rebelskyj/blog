<p>As some of you might know, this is my finals week here at Grinnell in London. Somehow, it’s also my easiest ever finals week. In total, I had one paper, one homework assignment, two presentations, and one final to do this week. Of these, I’ve finished one presentation, done all of the prep work for the other, done<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> most of the work on the paper, started the homework assignment, and studied for the final. It’s weird how different finals week feels without the stress of having a bunch to do. It’s weirder not being surrounded by people who are at least as stressed as you, almost in a competitive way. But, I’ll get back to Grinnell just in time for that part of finals week, so I guess I have that to look forward to</p>
