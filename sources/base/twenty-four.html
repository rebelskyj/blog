<p>Thanks for following me on this journey! I’m hopeful that this will let me reflect on the passage of time more intentionally.

<p>Note 3 June: I’ve apparently done eighteen new things this year, which is two or three<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> fewer new tasks than I would like to be at now. My standards are absolutely dropping here, but that is probably ok. After all, I am generally ok with who I am as a person, so remaining myself isn’t anything too bad.</p>
