<p>Today was a new beginning for me! I began my second paper journal since arriving in London. Thankfully, it was a duplicate of the first, so I’m able to see what’s changed.</p>
<p>For instance, where I spilled almond oil on it at the beginning of the semester,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> it’s still oily. The pages have gotten darker, the cover has faded, and it’s showing signs of use.</p>
<p>The new one, on the other hand, still looks nice. I can’t wait to see if this one fills, and what it fills with.</p>
