<p>Itâ€™s officially one week into NaNoWriMo<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, and Iâ€™m currently doing well. Iâ€™ve managed to write at least my word goal every day, and Iâ€™m almost a full day ahead now. Since the last time I attempted it<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, the website has changed a lot. Itâ€™s much more user friendly now, and itâ€™s far more gamified as well.</p>
<p>Thereâ€™s even an achievement for hitting par<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> every day in the month, which has been my primary motivating factor. One thing I have noticed, though, is that the daily goal appears to update based on how many words you have left to 50000. I wonder if that means itâ€™ll set itself to 0 when I surpass the goal.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Huh, also apparently thereâ€™s more text in this document in the footnotes than in the actual text. I guess my asides are more content than I expected them to be. I</p>

<li id="fn4" role="doc-endnote"><p>currently scheduled for the 27th, but Iâ€™m also writing faster as the days go on, which is interesting. I canâ€™t tell how much of that is due to increases in typing speeds, increases in knowing what I want to write, decreases in forced revision and pauses for words, or decreases in average word length. Iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s some way for me to track it, but I donâ€™t really feel like testing any of it right now. All I know is my last 10 minute writing session was over 700 words, which is about as fast as Iâ€™ve scored on some typing tests.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">â†©ï¸Ž</a></p></li>
