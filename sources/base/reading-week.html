<p>Today is Friday. It’s also the Friday ending what my host university calls “Reading Week.” As class ended last week, my professor made a note of that, before commenting that little to no reading happens during reading week.</p>
<p>I planned on reading during reading week. But, Monday turned into Tuesday turned into today, and I did no studying. Somehow, I even read less of my pleasure reading than I tend to do. But, I did destress, which is important, since I didn’t realize how ragged I’d been running myself. So, I guess I read the right amount?</p>
