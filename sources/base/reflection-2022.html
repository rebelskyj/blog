<p>As with <a href="restarting.html">my</a> last <a href="ending-18.html">two</a> yearly reflections, I’m going to start with five positive things that happened to me in 2022, and five things I’m excited for in 2023.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Passing my second year exam</p></li>
<li><p>Getting an accordion!</p></li>
<li><p>Restarting this blog!</p></li>
<li><p>Writing two books</p></li>
<li><p>Learning that I can run 5 miles when I need to.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at the five things I was excited for in 2022, there’s a lot of overlap. As always, though, more wonderful things happened than I could have ever expected.</p>
<p>As I look to the coming year, I’m excited to/for:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Passing my third year exam</p></li>
<li><p>Self-publishing a book</p></li>
<li><p>Taking an improv class</p></li>
<li><p>Watching my littlest brother graduate</p></li>
<li><p>Growing in my relationships</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="reflection-on-december">Reflection on December</h2>
<p>My goals last month were:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Blog every day.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch every day.</p></li>
<li><p>Write another 50000 word book.</p></li>
<li><p>Catch up on BiaY.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I accomplished the final one of those only. That’s kind of sad, but I suppose natural.</p>
<p>Looking into 2023, I’ve <a href="new-year-plans-23.html">already planned out most of it.</a></p>
<p>This month in particular, I would like to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Blog daily. I have faith in myself.</p></li>
<li><p>Listen to the BiaY and CCCiaY on average once a day each</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch daily</p></li>
<li><p>Write a poem a day</p></li>
<li><p>Write a piece of music a day</p></li>
<li><p>Write through Chapter 35 of the book I’m self publishing</p></li>
<li><p>Practice music daily</p></li>
<li><p>Say a rosary a day</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="theme">Theme</h2>
<p>I think my theme is going to be Schedule. I find that my life works better the less I leave what I do to chance, and so I want to regiment out my day more. I’ve tried using auto-generated lists these past few days for the things I want to do daily, and that’s been really helpful.</p>
<p>Happy 2023!</p>
