<p>So the last time I can find that I mused about baking, I mused about <a href="baking-take-four.html">a recipe I was working on.</a> Today is sort of the opposite.</p>
<p>I’ve found that<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> when I bake bread in the morning, I feel better about the day and I am more productive. To test that, I made bread dough last night and woke up slightly early to bake it this morning. It came out really well, which was great.</p>
<p>While I was making it, though, I considered what I was doing. Something that popped into my mind was a meme format I’ve seen going around a lot for the past few years. The general conceit is that someone is reflecting on how excited their ancestors would be of the quality of their living conditions.</p>
<p>I thought about the fact that I was actively choosing to make bread, not out of any need, but simply with the desire to feed my friends. I worked with finely ground white flour, which I was able to mix using drinkable water that is within my home. When I decided to bake it, I have an oven within my home.</p>
<p>It was a nice feeling, though I think the productivity was a little overstated. I didn’t end up doing as much as I wanted throughout the day, though I did get an early start, which was nice. Maybe my day wasn’t going to be productive regardless of my choices, in which case what I did was the best I could do.</p>
<p>In any case, I got to share fresh baked bread with friends, and that made me happy.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<li id="fn2" role="doc-endnote"><p>a fun anecdote from sharing. Someone asked me about my recipe. I replied, “I put water in the bowl, added flour, realized it wasn’t enough dough, so added more of each.” which even I recognized was not a helpful recipe.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
