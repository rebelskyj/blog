<p>As I mentioned <a href="sharing-a-song.html">about a month ago</a>, I wrote and shared a song with some friends. Last Monday, I performed the song for the first time in public. It was a good time, even though it didn’t go exactly how I’d hoped.</p>
<p>That is, the tempo got a little messed up between me and the other band members, and the mic placement wasn’t quite right. Still it was very rewarding to share something I wrote, as terrifying as it is. After the show, I realized that the concern I had about being booed was completely unrealistic. Even if the song had been horrible<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, the vibes at the open mic are very supportive generally.</p>
<p>The song was reviewed as incredibly sad, which is a little funny to me as I think about it more. Certainly the lyrics are sad, and I performed it in a sad way<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, but when played, even at tempo, on an accordion or piano, it’s very clear that the piece is just in a standard major key. My friends told me it was enjoyable, and that’s nice.</p>
<p>One of them sent me a message after the show saying that it was brave of me to play the song, which was nice. Anyways, I’m excited to keep playing with this band in the future.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
