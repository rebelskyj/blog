<p>It’s been around 8 months since I <a href="novel-update-6.html">last updated</a> the blog about a novel I was working on.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I tried to work on it until around June, but gave up for whatever reason.</p>
<p>I’ve decided that I do like a lot of the things I was working on in the book, so I want to rework it. Unlike what I was doing before, though, I think that this time I would like to revise the book by going through and fully rewriting it. Currently I’m working on plotting out when I want to hit certain plot points.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> I’ve never tried writing a book like this before, so I hope that it ends up working better for me.</p>
