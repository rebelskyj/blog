<p>It’s been almost a full month since my last update! I’ve had some struggles with writing it, and only wrote 8000 words since the beginning of the month. Since the 19th, when last I wrote this, I have managed to write nearly 20000. It’s a little sad that in those nine days I wrote more than I have these past two weeks. Still, though, I guess the writing pace isn’t too horrible. I may be writing slower, though not a ton slower. If I throw out last week, where I had no mental energy for anything, I think I’m actually still on pace.</p>
<p>If I want to reach my goal of 5000 words by the end of the month, I only need to write about 1000 words a day, which is pretty nice. I’ve been trying to write 2000 words a day, which means that I’d end up well ahead of my goal.</p>
<p>Unrelatedly, I feel very strange writing this post. These past few days have really been a struggle to post at all, and I’m not totally sure why.</p>
