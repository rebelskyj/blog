<p>I donâ€™t have the mental energy tonight to figure out a real recipe. Instead, here is a recipe for boiled water. This is often used in such dishes as pasta and pasta-related dishes.</p>
<p>Ingredients:<br />
Water: 1 Quart<br />
Salt to Taste</p>
<p>Pour water and salt together in a large pot. Put on high heat until water begins to form bubbles that disturb the surface. Remove from heat.</p>
