<p>It’s been a little less than a year since <a href="lemon-wine.html">the last time I mused about lemon wine,</a> and it seems like an appropriate time to do so again. Last year I apparently made a single batch of lemon wine before writing the musing. I ended up making one or two others, which was really fun.</p>
<p>This year, the recipe has changed slightly. As before, I cooked approximately eight pounds of sugar in water. This time, though, instead of lemon juice, I used pure citric acid.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> I also took a note from my second batch last year and didn’t add the lemon juice to my must.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons I think that’s a good idea, most of which revolve around the fact that my yeast can’t metabolize citric acid and I don’t really want it to metabolize the ascorbic acid.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The other flavoring oils shouldn’t be digestible, and again, I would like them to remain. Also, adding lemon juice drastically drops the pH of the solution,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and I don’t want to stress my yeast out.</p>
<p>It’s really strange to me how many flavor notes fermented sugar water has even without other additives. I don’t think I really believed that different yeasts actually produced ester profiles before this. The fermentation seems to be stalling out a little bit, but I’m hopeful that it won’t be true in the morning. If it is, I’ll do my usual lifehack of sprinkling a small amount of yeast nutrient to get rid of all the dissolved carbon dioxide<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>It looks like I’ve historically used three quarts of lemon juice, which still seems like an appropriate amount. Anyways, I’m excited to see how this batch comes out. I think I’m going to do something that I’ve thought about since I started making lemon wine<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>, and dry hop it. I’ll go into more detail about what dry hopping is when that becomes relevant.</p>

<li><p>I got an air filter and set it up.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Blogging streak day three</p></li>
<li><p>Air quality got even worse, so I took a day off of exercise</p></li>
<li><p>I slept with my window open last night, and didn’t realize the air quality was going to suffer so much. As a result, I slept poorly and in.</p></li>
<li><p>I listened to a lot of CCCiaY and prayed the chaplet of St. Michael the Archangel over breakfast. As yesterday, I’ll also do a rosary in bed.</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote two chapters today! That technically means that I’m three ahead. As soon as tomorrow’s chapter posts, though, it’ll be back to two ahead. Still exciting!</p></li>
<li><p>Wrote a sonnet last night! Will not write one tonight because wow time flew.</p></li>
<li><p>Didn’t write a letter. Should consider doing that tomorrow morning.</p></li>
