<p>Wisdom 7:7b “I called upon God, and the spirit of wisdom came to me.”</p>
<p>Today is the 26 Sunday of Ordinary Time in Year B.</p>
<p>Today’s first reading tells two important things. First, if you pray to the Lord for help, he will aid you. Second, wisdom is the ultimate treasure anyone can have.</p>
<p>The second reading echoes this sentiment, calling that “For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword.”<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> To me, this is such a meaningful statement. The word of God is what caused creation to be, is what breathes life into all of creation, and is what calls us each day to follow Him more closely. I know I don’t do it enough, but I do really appreciate the time I spend listening and reading the Word.</p>
