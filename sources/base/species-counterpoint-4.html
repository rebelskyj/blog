<p>So species counterpoint reflection is on Wednesdays now. Fourth species is an interesting challenge to me. More than any other species<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, it makes me want to work entirely back to front.</p>
<p>That is, I know what note I want to end on, and the penultimate note and often antipenultimate note. Once I’ve gotten those notes, the way that suspensions works means that I often have at most a single choice to meet the rules. It’s kind of interesting in a way.</p>
<p>That being said, I for sure need to spend at least the full week on fourth species. It’s not intuitive for me yet.</p>
