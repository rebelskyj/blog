<p>Another month has passed me by! I said my goals last month were</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Blog daily. I have faith in myself.</p></li>
<li><p>Listen to the BiaY and CCCiaY on average once a day each</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch daily</p></li>
<li><p>Write a poem a day</p></li>
<li><p>Write a piece of music a day</p></li>
<li><p>Write through Chapter 35 of the book I’m self publishing</p></li>
<li><p>Practice music daily</p></li>
<li><p>Say a rosary a day</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In reality I:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Blogged 12 times.</p></li>
<li><p>Listen to the BiaY and CCCiaY much less than once averaged</p></li>
<li><p>Stretched at least 10 times</p></li>
<li><p>Actively gave up on the poetry goal.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Wrote Fifteenish pieces</p></li>
<li><p>Wrote through Chapter 23 of the book I’m self publishing</p></li>
<li><p>Practiced music most days</p></li>
<li><p>Said very few rosaries</p></li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, most of the time, I was not aimlessly wasting away my time, which is one of the reasons I wanted to have more activities to do. I found that my scheduled list of events ceased to be useful about when I started being busy again.</p>
<p>Other things I did this month include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Being asked to play for a musical and spent about 10 hours last weekend recording guitar</p></li>
<li><p>Finished a draft of my 1 page for my third year exam</p></li>
<li><p>Started lifting with friends!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, I’m glad for the month, for all that I really wish that i had recorded more of it here. It passed by in a blur, and that makes me sad.</p>
