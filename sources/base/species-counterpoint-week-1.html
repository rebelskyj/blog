<p>As I<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> said, Saturdays are now for reflecting on a week of species counterpoint progress. This week has gone well! I managed to do it all six days.</p>
<p>After day three, I decided<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> that I wasn’t gaining much from the first species, so I decided to move on to second species. I think it might be fun to switch on day three of each week, though I’m not totally sure why.</p>
<p>Anyways, I’m enjoying it and getting better at it. I’m excited to see if it transfers to the quartet I’m writing tomorrow.</p>
