<p>In October of 2018, I apparently wrote about <a href="writing-a-song.html">writing a song</a>. Despite the fact that I’ve done a lot of composing, I realize now that most of it happened in the dark ages.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> As a result, I don’t know that I’ve talked about writing a song at all.</p>
<p>Anyways, I wrote most of a song, which I’ve shared about previously.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> I shared the song with the person I play open mics with yesterday, and he liked it.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> It’s really scary to share things you make with people around you, so I’m glad for his reaction. Now I just have to finish it and muster the courage to share it with people at an open mic.</p>
