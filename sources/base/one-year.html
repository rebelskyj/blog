<p>It’s been one year.</p>
<p>What am I supposed to do with that?</p>
<p>I miss you.</p>
<p>I’m sad that you couldn’t be there to watch me graduate.</p>
<p>I’m sad that I can’t talk to you about my first few days at work. You would have laughed at how I forgot what meaningful use is.</p>
<p>The sunset on the lake was beautiful tonight; I’m sorry that you never got to sit on the dock and watch it like you wanted.</p>
<p>I’ve been generally doing well; I don’t tear up when the fact that you died comes up any more.</p>
<p>I’m not doing well right now; tears are flowing.</p>
<p>There’s a poem and accompanying textpost on tumblr about the way that men love. One that stuck out to me was the man who became a cobbler because his own mother was buried without shoes.</p>
<p>I am not an oncologist, and I could never be one; watching even one mother die like you did would break me forever. I will work with oncology; even though better charting wouldn’t have saved you, it still feels like what I can do.</p>
<p>It’s been one year.</p>
<p>It feels like it’s been forever.</p>
<p>It feels like yesterday.</p>
<p>It’s been one year. One fucking year.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>So much still hurts. I don’t use purple or pink any more. I can’t listen to the Bible or Catechism in a Year; that was supposed to be something we did together. I can’t write my web novel; that was what you said helped during chemo.</p>
<p>The death certificate says that it’s been a year. Of course, the death certificate is right; the world exists as the bureaucracy says and no other way. Even though it’s been a year, it’s been more than a year since the last time you held me. It’s been more than a year since the last words you spoke.</p>
<p>I want to think that the last thing you heard me say was “I love you”. For my sake, I hope that I got to say goodbye, even if I only meant for the night.</p>
<p>I think that part of me will always be stuck in bed, waking up to the sound of my brother knocking on my door. Even without him saying anything, I knew.</p>
<p>Part of me will always be stuck at the side of your deathbed, saying the Lux Aeterna, since I was the only one who had a prayer ready.</p>
<p>Part of me will be at your deathbed before you died, when you said that you didn’t care about the funerary arrangements except that you wanted them to be Catholic. I haven’t been able to sing City of God in almost a year.</p>
<p>It’s been a year.</p>
<p>One friend who you never got to meet texted me today. I think you would have loved her.</p>
<p>It’s been a year.</p>
<p>I didn’t do as you asked; I graduated before [].<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> I hope that you wouldn’t be mad at me. It sucks so much that not only did I have a graduation that felt rushed, not only did I have to do it without you, but all the while I was doing it I knew deep in my heart and keenly in my mind that I was disobeying your last wishes.</p>
<p>Part of me is mad.</p>
<p>You gave me a task related to both of my brothers. I don’t think that you gave them one related to me.</p>
<p>It’s been a year.</p>
<p>I haven’t had these great wracking sobs in months. I almost forgot what it felt like to have tears leaking down my face as each breath catches, regardless of what else is going on.</p>
<p>It’s been a year.</p>
<p>I haven’t had anyone message me or stop me in the street to say how much you meant to them in what feels like a decade; rationally I know it can’t have been more than seven months.</p>
<p>It’s been a year.</p>
<p>You told us not to stay at your bedside day in and day out. Does it make me a bad son to have listened?</p>
<p>I look at the last photos we took as a family, and I hardly recognize you. When the friend asked me if I remembered your face, I could only think of the photo you used for everything; I think that it was at least fifteen years old by the time that you retired it.</p>
<p>At the wake, I had to walk away and sit alone. Despite everyone knowing that I was doing that to be alone, I still had a number of people stop in. I scrolled through my voice messages, knowing that I had never deleted any.</p>
<p>It took five years of scrolling to find one from you.</p>
<p>I guess that I’m glad I always picked up.</p>
<p>I’m sad that, in the over a year we had planning for your death, I never had you send me a message simply saying “I love you”.</p>
<p>It’s been a year.</p>
<p>The weekend I came back to Madison, or at least what feels like it, I went to a club with a friend for her birthday. While waiting outside the bathroom for a friend, I met another mother dying of cancer; she had no idea how to tell her children. I was able to tell her that I appreciated everything you did for us, and that I made it through.</p>
<p>It’s been a year, and yet part of me still feels like I should have covered mirrors. It feels wrong to realize that I wore a white shirt today of all days. Today was too beautiful of a day to be a reminder that you’re gone forever.</p>
<p>Today was far too lacking in beauty to be a reminder of the day your pain stopped.</p>
<p>It’s been a year.</p>
<p>Anything else I have to say belongs to you, and you alone.</p>
<p>It’s been a year.</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>Goodbye again.</p>
<p>Goodbye forever.</p>
<p>It’s been a year.</p>
<p>How do I still have smiles inside of me?</p>
<p>How do I tell the people around me that the reason I don’t mention you when talking about what my family does isn’t estrangement? I guess it’s the most permanent form of estrangement, so I suppose they understand.</p>
<p>It’s been a year.</p>
<p>maybe if I say that one more time, or one time more, it will tell my heart that it can heal.</p>
<p>it’s been a year</p>
<p>three hundred and sixty five days</p>
<p>thirteen moons, I think.</p>
<p>one year</p>
