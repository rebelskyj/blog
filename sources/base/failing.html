<p>Assuming anyone actaully reads my daily posts, they might have noticed that yesterday, for the first time in more than 70 days, I didnâ€™t update. In a way, it was sort of a relief. I knew that at some point, I wouldnâ€™t be able to update every day, so getting it out of the way was a relief. I had visited Belgium to see a friend, and didnâ€™t find the time to make a post. I also didnâ€™t write for NaNoWriMo, but since I was well ahead of schedule,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Iâ€™m not too worried. Anyways, now I have the difficult decision: do I keep with one a day, or do I write two today?</p>
<p>Iâ€™m unsure which Iâ€™ll do</p>
