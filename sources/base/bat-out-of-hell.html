<p>Tonight, I had the wonderful opportunity to see <em>Bat Out Of Hell</em> at the Dominion Theatre. It was an odd show for a lot of reasons.</p>
<p>Plot wise, it definitely felt like Peter Pan. There were some fun fourth wall breaks, including the orchestra coming out with broken instruments. It was really fun, especially as a sing-along.</p>
