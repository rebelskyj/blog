<p>Luke 10:20 “Nevertheless, do not rejoice because the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice because your names are written in heaven.”</p>

<p>Today is the 14th Sunday of Ordinary Time. Since I stopped these reflections in the Easter season, it’s kind of strange not having a season I can orient my reflections on.</p>
<p>The last line of the Gospel today is really striking to me. Christ commands his followers to go to the neighboring towns to share the good news.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> They return rejoicing, because they have power over demons now. Christ reorients their joy.</p>
<p>Rather than focusing on the temporal benefits of faith, He reminds us that everything is good only in how it leads us to Heaven. That’s something I need to remind myself more about. A rich prayer life is only worth celebrating in how it orients my will to the Lord’s. Struggles are only damaging in how they damage my trust in Him.</p>
<p>I’m sure there’s a deeper level to today’s readings, but this is all that I have right now.</p>
