<p>Today was the first day of the Conference Championship meet. I placed third. My score wasn’t great, and my diving wasn’t either, so that made sense. I threw 205c for the first time this year<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> for a fairly ok score, so all in all, I’m calling today a win.</p>
