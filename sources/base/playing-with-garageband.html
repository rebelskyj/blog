<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>Today, I was on a five hour train ride. While on the ride, I was doing some homework on the iPad that Grinnell College lent me for the semester. Then, having finished the homework, I decided to play around on the iPad. I saw that the iPad came with GarageBand, so I thought I’d play with it. It was fun!</p>
<p>I forgot how much fun it can be to make musical sounds with synthesizers. Of course, it took around three hours to make a just under three minute long piece,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> but that’s still less time than composing, recording, and then post processing. It wasn’t great, but people who’ve listened to it have responded more positively than neutrally. If you’d like to hear it, feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:flyingrebelpipes@gmail.com">flyingrebelpipes@gmail.com</a>.</p>
