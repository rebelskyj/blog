<h1 id="draft-2-179-october-2018">Draft 2: 179 October 2018</h1>
<p>Diaries, like many aspects of stereotypical female adolescence, are a nebulous concept.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> But, like any scientist, I hate undefined concepts.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> So, I’ve been thinking about what a diary really is.</p>
<p>I tried defining it a few different ways. First was through exclusion. In <em>A Brief History of Diaries,</em> <em>Meditations</em> by Marcus Aurelius is considered a diary, as is a shopkeeper’s logbook. Both of those didn’t seem to fit what I would consider a diary, but I couldn’t figure out why.</p>
<p>Then came the idea of<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> splitting all types of writing into binary divisions. It took a few tries, but I think I’ve gotten something that works. Of course, writers hate dichotomies,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> so I needed to make sure that each category was a real dichotomy.</p>
<p>If we look at all writing that is, was, or will be,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> there are only two kinds of writing.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> There is writing concerned with reality,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> and writing that isn’t concerned with reality.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Of course, an immediate push back to this would be “what about writing that is partially concerned with reality?” That’s non-fictive. It is concerned with reality. It’s like saying “a room either has some form of lighting, or it doesn’t.” Dimmer lighting, or lighting only in one corner still satisfies.</p>
<p>Obviously,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> diaries have a focus on reality, so they are non-fictive. Next, all non-fictive writing is either focused on a single entity, with the rest of creation<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> serving as a backdrop to it, or not doing that.</p>
<p>It may be helpful to give examples of writing in each category. In the biographical category, there are diaries and biographies. In the non-biographical category, we see things like epic poetry.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>So if I ignore that, all writing concerned with reality is either narrative or not.</p>
<p>BREAK</p>
<p>To me, a diary<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> is a non-retrospective, autobiographical, narrative, biographical, non-fictive piece of writing. In order, I’ll explain each of these pieces, from least to most specific.</p>
<p>As a person who’s taken Linguistics, I understand the importance of grouping things into dichotomies. As an artist, I understand the frustration of false dichotomies. So, I’ve attempted to group all writings into mutually exclusive categories. First is fictive and null-fictive writing.</p>
<p>Confusingly, my definitions are based the opposite way here. Null-fictive writing is writing concerned with portraying reality, while fictive writing is not.</p>
<p>All writing concerned with reality either has a singular entity at its focus: biographical, or not, null.</p>
<p>All biographical writing is either narrative: biographies and whatnot, or null: blurbs.</p>
<p>All biographies are either autobiographical: about self, or not: all other biographies.</p>
<p>Finally, all biographies are either retrospective: all the action takes place before writing, or not: diaries.</p>

<p>What’s a diary? To me, a diary<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> is a non-retrospective, autobiographical, narrative, biographical, non-fictive piece of writing. In order, I’ll explain each of these pieces, from least to most specific.</p>
