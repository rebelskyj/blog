<p>Today was the first day of the new semester and academic year. Unlike <a href="first-day-of-class-S2022.html">my last post about a new semester</a>, I didn’t see friends. I also didn’t have any class today.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Instead, I started my day by TA’ing, which looks like it’ll be fun. I’m helping with the graduate instrumental course, which I’m very excited for. Tomorrow I have my first actual class period, which I’m also pumped for.</p>
<p>In other exciting news, I got free breakfast<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> and lunch<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> from different organizations giving things to students today. I also gave blood, and got a t-shirt for that, along with other various knick-knacks from a fair.</p>
<p>Of course, there were some not bright parts of the day. On my walk to work I saw some horrible anti-semitic hate chalked brightly and in large letters in a central campus location. That didn’t really set me up for a happy day. While giving blood they missed my vein and wandered around for a while, jabbing the muscle more than once.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>But, I’ll move on from the less than happy and back to the joyful. I found out my band is planning to play a song I wrote next Monday!<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> I got a free donut from someone whose birthday it was, and I got to go to a meet-and-chat with the person who discovered pulsars. I also finally placed requests for the different books which explain early thoughts on the harmony of the spheres.</p>
<p>All in all, this semester is shaping up to be a fun one!</p>
