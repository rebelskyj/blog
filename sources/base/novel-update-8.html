<p>Apparently I have the same ideas for writing week-by-week. That’s kind of funny, but I hope that changes soon.</p>
<p>Anyways, these past few days, I’ve managed to get a chapter a day written, which is really nice. The chapters have been differently good, and have needed different amounts of revision. I’ve started using the chapters as ways to test on different ways to write better/more efficiently.</p>
<p>As it turns out, if spend five minutes plotting a chapter before I write it, it comes out much better and faster. I don’t know why that works, but it’s nice to know. On the other hand, it means that I need to know where my journal is at all times.</p>
<p>That’s nice, because I want to get through my journals faster. So yeah, I’m going to try to do that more.</p>
