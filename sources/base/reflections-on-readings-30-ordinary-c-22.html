<p>Luke 18:13 “But the tax collector stood off at a distance and would not even raise his eyes to heaven but beat his breast and prayed, ‘O God, be merciful to me a sinner.’”</p>

<p>I really love today’s Gospel, because it gets directly to the heart of the Christian call to holiness. We are not saved through our own actions. We are not holy through our own merits. Rather, we are called to remember that we are sinners, and the good in our life comes from He who is Good.</p>
<p>St. Paul reminds us that we are strong enough to do what He calls us to do, because we are given the strength we need. The First Reading reminds us that there is no one the Lord does not hear.</p>
