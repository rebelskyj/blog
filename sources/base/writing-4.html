<p>It was just <a href="writathon-23-april.html">yesterday</a> that I talked about how I’d like to keep up writing even though I no longer need to. As it turns out, I am incredibly motivated by deadlines. Without the explicit need to write 2000 words to put out a chapter today, I didn’t end up writing more than 1000 total words, and almost all of those came after 5pm. I need to think of how to make myself write even when there’s not a deadline. At worst, that seems like a skill I should be able to transfer.</p>
