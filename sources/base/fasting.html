<p>Today is Ash Wednesday, which is a traditional day of fasting in the Catholic Church.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Additionally, the Pope dedicated today as a day of fasting and prayer for peace in Ukraine. So, I found myself fasting today.</p>
<p>Something major that I’ve noticed about my fasting self is that I struggle to focus far more. I guess less so I struggle to focus and moreso that I struggle to begin working. Once I start working, I have been able to finish at least as much as normal, though maybe at a slower rate.</p>
<p>This gives me some interesting knowledge. Apparently if I am feeling unfocused and hazy in the future I should consider whether I’ve eaten enough recently.</p>
<p>Moving past my own experience of how fasting is less than ideal<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> for my work life<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, I do think that fasting helps me refocus my days. I haven’t done as good of a job today recentering myself when I feel hungry on faith, and I think that’s something that I can work about in the future. That’s something I could work on in the future I think, and it would probably make my life better for doing so.</p>
