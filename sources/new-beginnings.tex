\section{Draft 2}
Today was a new beginning for me!
I began my second paper journal since arriving in London.
Thankfully, it was a duplicate of the first, so I'm able to see what's changed.

For instance, where I spilled almond oil on it at the beginning of the semester,\footnote{don't ask} it's still oily.
The pages have gotten darker, the cover has faded, and it's showing signs of use.

The new one, on the other hand, still looks nice.
I can't wait to see if this one fills, and what it fills with.

Additionally, I got ahead on blogging for the first time!\footnote{YAY!}

\section{Draft 1}
Today, is the 21 of November.
I like the 21sts of the months, because that's when solstices and equinoxes.\footnote{it should really be spelled equinoces in my opinion but}
In many cultures, the equinox or solstice is a day of new beginning.
