Fifth Species counterpoint is fun!
I like writing melodies, and I realize how much I love suspensions.
Maybe in part because of the way the system is set up,\footnote{with suspensions being fourth species} I use them a lot.
Anyways, despite\footnote{sadly} missing two days this week, I still feel ready to move on to First Species with Three Voices.
Exciting wow.
Rules
\begin{itemize}
\item Only Whole notes
\item Consonance is defined against the lowest pitch
\item Upper two voices allow consonances, P4, tritone
\item Try to have mostly triad voicing
\end{itemize}
Woo! Let's have some fun.
