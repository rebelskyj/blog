\section{Draft 1}
Right now I'm reading a lot of LitRPG's and some nearby genres.
I'm not sure why, but if I had to guess, it's mostly because the books generally expect minimal mental effort from me and have interesting premises.
Anyways, I hope that I'll start reading more thought-provoking books soon, but since I'm also planning to begin writing a book\footnote{maybe an upcoming post}, who knows if that'll happen
