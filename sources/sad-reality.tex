\section{Draft 1}
Today, I got to watch my little brother at one of his last high school swim meets.
During it, he lost his goggles as he started his 100 butterfly.
And then he set a new personal best, by a not-insignificant margin.
It's sad when that happens, because now there's an incentive to dive goggleless.
