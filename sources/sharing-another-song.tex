\section{Draft 1}
Wow! Two months ago today I \href{sharing-a-song}{talked about when I shared a song I wrote}.
It's so weird to me how in those two months I went from terrified of playing a song in front of a single friend to willing to just play a half-finished song at an open mic.

However, it was generally well received, and it was fun to have the band back together.\footnote{mostly}
