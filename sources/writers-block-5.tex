\section{Draft 1}
First, apparently I never published my \href{writers-block-4.html}{last writer's block post}, and instead linked to an older one.
Wild.

Anyways, for whatever reason, I can't think of what to blog about today.
I've written over 2000 words of my novel, which is nice, and this is my last activity with my computer before I write my poem of the day.\footnote{which I've taken to doing in my journal.}
I guess I could talk about how those are going.

The novel is going interestingly, because it's not something that I did even the slightest bit of planning about.
More or less, the impetus for the novel was a few vignettes that I'd been thinking about, which had no temporal connection.
As a result, writing them results in something very much the same.

In the poem, I wrote a meta-poem villanelle the first day and a sonnet the second.
Today I'm going to try a free poem, but who knows how well that will go.
Huh, just like that, I'm at over 150 words.
