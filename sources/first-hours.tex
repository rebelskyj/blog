\section{Draft 1}
As in \href{first-56-hours.html}{one of my first posts}, I'm using this as a space to reflect on my time back home.
Not much has changed at Grinnell, other than some new faces showing up and some old faces not being there.
The codes to some doors I need to use have changed, others have stayed the same.
All in all, these first few hours back in Grinnell are far less shocking than the same in London.
