\section{Draft 1}
I mentioned \href{twenty-four.html}{recently} that I learned how to repair an accordion.
I don't know if I've mentioned here yet that I own an accordion, but I do.

More or less, one row of the bass reeds had fallen into the bellows of my instrument.\footnote{no I don't know how}
Now that I know how to, fixing it is as simple as opening the bass side up by removing six pins and slotting the row back into place.
However, I did not know that at the time, and ended up spending around two hours to get to that point of knowledge.
I'm glad for the mistakes I made, because they'll help me do better in the future!
