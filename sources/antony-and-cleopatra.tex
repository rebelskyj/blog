\section{Draft 1}
Tofay I had the wonderful opportunity to see \textit{Antony and Cleopatra} as performed at the National Theatre.
It was really well-staged and lit.
The sounds were amazing, with one exception.

In the script, it calls for the predecessor of the oboe and bassoon to be playing, as it's an eerie sound.
Instrad, the show chose to use cello.
It was certainly a different effect, and not one that I personally was a fan of.
But, overall, the sounds were fantastic.

The show was a modern adaptation, and was skillfully executed.
The stage continually amazed me, and was hard for me to even comprehend how it some of the changes might be done.
