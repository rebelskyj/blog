\section{Draft 1}
As many of you know, today is All Saints Day.
Coincidentally, that means that today is also the first of November.
Now, in addition to being the month dedicated to a focus on men's\footnote{lack of} mental health, November is also NaNoWriMo.\footnote{National Novel Writers Month}
And, since I lack most of the time consuming activities I have at Grinnell,\footnote{sport, ensembles, (most of) my instruments, much of the studying, a job, etc} I have more free time here.
So, I  decided I'd try to write 50,000 additional words this month, or around 1700 a day.
Now, according to my quick and dirty approximation, I've written approximately 750 words a day for these posts.

That's a shame.
I guess that I'm going to have to triple my daily word count, since this isn't an excuse for me to stop posting, and I don't want to subject others to the horror of my attempts at creative writing.
