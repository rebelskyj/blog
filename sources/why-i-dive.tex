\section{\href{why-i-dive.html}{Why I Dive}}
\section{Draft 2}
When people find out that I dive, a frequent question is why.
There are a variety of reasons for that.
The most common\footnote{given} reason for this is that I don't look like a diver.
That is, many people seem to think\footnote{not incorrectly} that I am much larger than the average diver.
The other reason people seem disbelieving is that I'm not too terribly flexible.
I don't disagree with either assessment, but they don't affect my choice for one key reason: I dive because I enjoy it, not because I dream of being the best.
If my size becomes a limit for how fast I can spin, that's fine because I don't need to be throwing 407B.\footnote{inward (face board and flip in) 3 1/2 pike (straight legs)}
Another reason I enjoy diving is that people really seem to appreciate watching the dives where I fail.\footnote{in person and in recordings}
If I'm being honest, I'm one of them.

Both of these are valid reasons for me to not dive, but they don't stop me.
Instead, I dive because I enjoy it, and I never expect to be great at it.
