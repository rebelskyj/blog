\section{Draft 1}
Tonight I had the wonderful opportunity to see \textit{La Bayadere} at the Royal Opera House.\footnote{I'm cultured now}
It was odd.

Apparently in ballet, unlike theatre, you're supposed to read what's going to happen ahead of time.
I did not.
I was confused. 

I did like the second act, though.
There were a couple of dances with the whole chorus that were super fun and made nice lines and shapes.

Overall, while not a fan of opera, at least I have another piece in the music to theatrical story spectrum.
It begins with symphony, then sound painting, then ballet, opera, musical, then non musical theatre.
Yay.
