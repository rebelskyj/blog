\section{Draft 1}
Today, I had the lovely pleasure of watching the 1985 classic American film \textit{Commando}, staring Arnold Schwarzenegger with 20 or so other members of my team.
All in all, it was a great movie for why we chose it.

The plot was straightforward enough that the chatting and constant interjections didn't make it hard to follow.
The dialogue was dumb, but punny.
The set was destroyed often.
There was a high body count.
So, what more could you really ask for in a college men's athletic movie night?\footnote{that is a rhetorical question. There are a lot of things that could have been better}
