First Published: 2019 January 10

Prereading note: I've realized that I've begun to use this blog more and more as a way to remember recipes so that I won't forget them.
\section{Draft 1}
Yesterday, I made tortillas.\footnote{in the same way that I make almost any food: almost certainly not traditionally, but as close as I get}
They were favorably reviewed.

The recipe is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Mix flour, salt, sugar, and oil together.
\item Add enough water
\item Mix and knead
\item Press into small shapes
\item Put on a very hot pan that's been lightly oiled
\item Flip often until cooked
\item Serve while warm
\end{enumerate}
