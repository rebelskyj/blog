Isaiah 53:11 \say{Because of his affliction he shall see the light in fullness of days; Through his suffering, my servant shall justify many, and their guilt he shall bear.}

Today is the 29 Sunday of Ordinary Time in Year B.

Today's first reading speaks about how someone will bear the sins and burdens for others.
In doing so, he will \say{justify many.}

I don't know why, but I really appreciate the imagery in the first reading.
