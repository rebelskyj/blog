\section{Draft 1}
Yesterday I fully intended to write a monthly reflection post, for all that it would be a full week late.
Instead, through a series of coincidences, I found that I was without my computer and away from home until far too late to write a post.

The story for those interested will be below.

We had a small birthday celebration for a group mate, which I left to go to a Fish Fry at a local church with friends.
While at the fish fry, I got to see another one of my group mates, who asked if I could come back to their home to help jump a car.
From there, I went to go catch up with a friend, which ended up resulting in me also catching up with a few other friends.
By the time I finally got to bed, it was well past one, but I felt very well socialized.

Tomorrow I will be posting my reflection, so I guess I'll reflect on the month on Monday.
