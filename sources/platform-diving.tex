\section{Draft 1}
Today, I tried platform diving for the first time.
For those unaware,\footnote{i.e. most everyone} there are two types of competitive diving.\footnote{ignoring like freediving and SCUBA and whatnot}
There's springboard\footnote{the thing that bounces, which I do} and platform.\footnote{which is a concrete platform}
I got to try 1, 3, and 5 meters today.
It was much different than springboard, and I kind of like it more.
We'll see how the rest of the semester goes.
