\section{Draft 1}
These past few days, my coach has commented that my hurdle has been suffering since coming back from abroad.
I couldn't remember what I had been doing differently, other than what I was still doing.\footnote{walking instead of prancing}
Today, I remembered that I modified my breathing while diving abroad, and tried that again today.
It worked!
Hooray.
