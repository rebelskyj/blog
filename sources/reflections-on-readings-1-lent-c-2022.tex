Deuteronomy 26:7: \say{we cried to the LORD, the God of our ancestors, and the LORD heard our cry and saw our affliction, our toil and our oppression}

\section{Draft 1}
The Lenten Season has begun, and with it the change of emotion for the readings.
This Gospel has been interesting to me since I learned that Satan in the Old Testament is not a rebel angel, but one of the faithful.\footnote{I think?}
It causes me to wonder a bit whether the temptations that our Lord receives are from the Betrayer or from a loyal angel simply doing his job.
In the end, it doesn't really matter, because our Lord resists the temptations, even while starving.

I don't know if I could stop myself from making bread from stones if I had fasted for a day, let alone forty.
We are called to be more like Christ in every way, and self-denial is definitely somewhere I can improve.
