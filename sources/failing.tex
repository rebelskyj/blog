\section{Draft 1}
Assuming anyone actaully reads my daily posts, they might have noticed that yesterday, for the first time in more than 70 days, I didn't update.
In a way, it was sort of a relief.
I knew that at some point, I wouldn't be able to update every day, so getting it out of the way was a relief.
I had visited Belgium to see a friend, and didn't find the time to make a post.
I also didn't write for NaNoWriMo, but since I was well ahead of schedule,\footnote{because of \href{exponential-growth.html}{my competitive nature}} I'm not too worried.
Anyways, now I have the difficult decision: do I keep with one a day, or do I write two today?

I'm unsure which I'll do
