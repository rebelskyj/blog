\section{\href{ending-18.html}{Ending 2018}}
First Published: 2018 December 31
\section{Draft 2}
As I finish this post in the early hours of the morning, 2018 is officially over.
And, as of the end of this post, this blog has 125 posts, which is a surprisingly nice and round number for being completely unplanned.\footnote{just three more to a nice one in base 2}
So, I thought I'd use this to look back at 2018.

2018 was a really fun year for me.
Due to it being late, and my having been up for a while, I don't remember most of it.
However, looking back, five big positive events for me this year were:
medaling at the Conference Swim and Dive meet,
joining the Track and Field team,
beginning the bagpipes,
going to London,\footnote{obviously}
and finally having a trimmed beard.

Of these, I think the final will prove to be the most impactful on my life in 2019.\footnote{who knows how serious I'm being? Not me!}
Since I reflected on five big changes in 2018, I feel like I should also list five things that excite me about 2019, which are:\footnote{again as they come to me}
learning the accordion,
figuring out what I'm going to do after college,
being a senior,
watching my little brother's final high school memories being made,
continuing to grow at the instruments I'm already taking.

Of course, three\footnote{ish} of the items that were most memorable to me about 2018 as I was writing this post weren't things that I knew would be happening at the beginning of the year.\footnote{bonus points to anyone who knows which three!}
So, more than anything, I'm excited to find out what new and wonderful events will change my life in 2019.
In the\footnote{modified} words of the immortal Caesar, \textit{venio, video, vivo.}
In English, that would be:say{I come, I see, I live.}
If I can't fail to be pretentious on New Year's Eve, then when?
Anyways, best of luck to anyone reading this, and a happy end of the Christmas Season.
