\section{Draft 1}
Some times in my life I really think of as listening times.
On some occasions that means hearing a friend as they share something deep and personal in their life.
At others, it means hearing a story or tale as it weaves.
Still others are when I get to sit in silence and hear my own thoughts as they interplay with the natural\footnote{or artificial, depending on locale} noises around me.
And finally, sometimes I get to listen to intentional music.

Tonight is one of those nights.
I was reminded of a fantastic curated playlist that an amazing person made for me, and got to listen to it.
There were no familiar songs on it, and only a few familiar artists, which made the experience fantastic.
Much like me, the playlist generator used so many genres and styles, which gave a very nice experience
