Luke 2:16  \say{And Mary kept all these things, reflecting on them in her heart}
\section{Draft 2}
Today is the Solemnity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Mother of God.
It's historically also the Feast of the Circumcision.
Despite the nominal focus on Mary, the readings seem to focus more on the old celebration to me.

The readings focus on Christ's fulfillment of the messianic prophecy.
