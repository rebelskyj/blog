\section{Draft 1}
Walking in winter is always interesting to me, especially when it's\footnote{relatively} warmer.
Tonight it was around freezing.
That being the case, I was wearing my coat unzipped, which a friend remarked on.
I thought back to childhood, where my ideal winter outfit was often warm gloves, a hat, boots, shorts, and a t-shirt.

As I've grown older, some of that's changed.
I've adapted to colder feet, and I've grown my hair to keep my ears warm.
My chest and legs have started getting colder, which is a little sad.
But, gloves\footnote{or some way to keep my hands warm} remain my most crucial winter clothing article.
