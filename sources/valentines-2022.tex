\section{Draft 1}
Today was my first Valentine's Day in a relationship, and it was really fantastic!
I spent the day at work, but then got to come home and make nice homemade meal for my significant other and I to enjoy.
For those curious, the meal was:
\begin{itemize}
\item a Salad\footnote{purchased from the store}
\item Homemade herb-laminated fettuccini with red pepper and tomato in a parmesan sauce 
\item Chocolate cake\footnote{a la \href{baking-take-four.html}{my previous competition bake}}
\end{itemize}
But, far more than the food, the company was incredible!
