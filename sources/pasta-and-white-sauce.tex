\section{Draft 1}
Since coming to London, I've been trying new and exciting recipes.\footnote{for very loose definitions of both words}
One of these, the focus of tonight's post, is pasta in white sauce.
There are a few reasons for this.

First, I like pasta.
It's a good comfort food and it's hard to make badly.
Second, I like milk based products.
Third, I like being able to pretend I made something, more than just dumping something into a pot.

So, the recipe:

Ingredients:\\
Pasta\\
Butter\\
Cheese\footnote{I've found that a little bit of Parmigiano-Reggiano goes a long way here}\\
Flour\\
Milk\\
Salt

To Make Sauce:\\
Put approximately equal portions of butter and flour in a pan over medium to low heat.\\
Mix until it begins to brown.\\
Add milk and cheese.\\
Stir, adding more milk as needed.\\
Add salt to taste.\\

To Make Pasta:\\
Salt water.\\
Cook Pasta.\\
Drain Pasta.\\
Put Pasta in Sauce.\\
Serve.\\
