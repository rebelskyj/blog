First Published: 2022 October 16

2 Timothy 4:2 \say{proclaim the word; be persistent whether it is convenient or inconvenient; convince, reprimand, encourage through all patience and teaching}

\section{Draft 1}
Today's readings remind us of the Gospel admonition to pray ceaselessly.
More than that, though, we are reminded of how our faith lives do not affect us alone.

When Moses lowers his hands from exhaustion, it is not only he who suffers.
All of Israel is pushed back.
And yet, we do not have to fight alone.
When he grows weary, Aaron and Hur support his arms.

We are also reminded of how, if we truly are living solely for Christ, our actions would be.
How often in our day to day lives do we stand obstinately in the face of some inconvenience to us?
How much worse is an eternity without the Lord, either for us or for those around?
