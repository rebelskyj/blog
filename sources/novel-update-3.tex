\section{Draft 1}
Do I feel guilty that I almost exclusively write about the other writing I do?
A little bit.

Will that stop me?
Not today apparently.

I've finally gotten far enough into the novel that I feel comfortable breaking into chapters.
This is a bit of a double edged sword, though.
I want my chapters to be around 1500-2500 words a piece.
I also want to write around 2000 words a day.
If your mind is going to the same place as mine, that means I'd be writing about 7 chapters a week.

That doesn't feel sustainable for me, if only because only one author that I follow publishes at that pace.
However, I feel like right now I'm able to keep it up, and it's\footnote{I think and hope} always better to have more to revise from than less.
I think I might try to use one day a week to edit, just so that everything flows well and the story arc works well, but who knows?
Maybe I'll just give up on the idea of a good story soon.
