\section{Draft 1}
Yesterday I gave the \href{talk-planning-1.html}{talk} \href{talk-planning-2.html}{that} \href{talk-planning-3.html}{I've} \href{talk-planning-4.html}{been} talking about for a while.
I think it went well, and I got mostly positive feedback.
It's very weird to be over it though, I feel like I didn't do anywhere as good of a job as I wanted, and I only read like half of what I was planning to read.

Still, it happened!
