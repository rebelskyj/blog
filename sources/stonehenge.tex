\section{Draft 1}
Today, I had the amazing opportunity to visit Stonehenge.
It's definitely not a monument I had ever  planned on visiting, so the fact that I went to it is really cool to me.
It's certainly more impressive and large than the mental image I had before seeing it.

Also, I brought my ukulele with me today, and while at a pub, was told that I could play it if I wanted.
While playing John Denver's beloved \textit{Take Me Home, Country Roads}, an elderly man at the bar joined along in singing.
It was great!
