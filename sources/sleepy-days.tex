\section{\href{sleepy-days.html}{Sleep Days}}
Some days you go to sleep, anxiously awaiting the coming morning and day. Other days you wake up, counting down the moments until you can go back to sleep.

There are many factors that can influence both of those, from what's happening in your life at a macro scale,\footnote{such as career outlook} at a micro scale,\footnote{what your plan is for the day}, and how much sleep you've gotten the night\footnote{or nights} before.

Today I remembered that sleep you miss is at least as important as the other two. I didn't sleep enough, and so today wasn't as fully experienced as it could be. I'm hoping tomorrow will be better.
