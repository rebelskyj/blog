\section{Draft 1}
Wow, one year ago \href{thesis-background-prep-1.html}{yesterday} I was writing about the last exam I had for graduate school.
I'm\footnote{thankfully} much further along in this one.
I just turned in the one page version of my proposed project.\footnote{not what I plan to do in my thesis, but something that I could hypothetically spend a post doc doing if I understand the prompt correctly.}
It was a fun time, and I hope my committee likes it.
