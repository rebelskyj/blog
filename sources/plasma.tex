\section{Draft 1}
Today I updated my \href{twenty-four.html}{twenty four for twenty four goal}\footnote{the short version is I want to do twenty four new things while I am twenty four years old}, which feels like as good of a reason to restart this blog as any.
On an impulse, I copied \href{rolls.html}{an old blog post}, because I was intrigued by what the title meant.
Interestingly, while discussing the definitions of \href{roll} in my life, I didn't discuss the diving/gymnastics centered meaning of the word.

Anyways, one experiment that I was given to rebuild as a part of my PhD progress has the goal of creating a standing plasma.
Last week I successfully produced a plasma for the first time in the instrument in over half a decade, which is incredible to me.
Now I need to optimize the plasma and make it usable for what we need.\footnote{read: it won't strike below around 200 mTorr of pressure, and our spectroscopic tools need generally sub 100 mTorr of pressure}
