\section{Draft 1}
As you might know, I started this blog in part because of assignments and people wondering what I was doing while abroad.
Now, abroad is over.
The assignment is also concluded.
Should I stop writing daily?

I think I won't, if only because I enjoy the idea of knowing that I've written something each day.
Likewise, I'll also continue my list of 5 things each day that were nice and out of the ordinary
