\section{Draft 1}
Tonight, I had the wonderful opportunity to attend the Chandos Chamber Choir Christmas Concert at Christ\footnote{wow that's a lot of C words} the Holy Redeemer Church.
In addition to hearing some lovely early music carols, as well as some modern takes on those early songs, there were also some audience sing-alongs.
It was great fun, especially because I didn't know all of the carols.
Sadly, they didn't have the audience sing my two favorite carols,\footnote{Veni, Veni Emmanuel and Angels We Have Heard on High} but that's life.

Overall, the concert was a great experience.
The choir was good, and the brass quintet was spectacular.
They served mince pies, so I had my first ever, which apparently means I get to make a wish.
Since finals week is coming up, I'm sure you can guess what I wished for.
