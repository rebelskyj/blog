\section{Draft 1}
Today, I had the opportunity of attending the Grinnellians in London\footnote{separate from Grinnell in London} alumni meetup.
It was really interesting.
After an hour or so of socializing, we were given a talk about Global Grinnell, and its initiatives.

I found it interesting that the focus was solely on English\footnote{or, as I was corrected, writing} people we were bringing to Grinnell.
When I asked about things that did not fit into this catagory, I was given a few examples in the social studies division, and theatre.
I find it odd that we don't do anything with S and M\footnote{since Grinnell doesn't have the TEA of STEAM} in a Global Grinnell, especially since more and more students are majoring in those disciplines.
But, maybe I just phrased my question badly.
