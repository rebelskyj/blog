\section{Draft 1}
New monthly reflection!

My goals were:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Blog daily
\item Compose a poem and music daily
\item Do the pushup/squat thing daily
\item Listen to BiaY Daily
\item Track my daily doings better in my journal
\end{enumerate}
I think I made a blog every day which was great.
I composed maybe five or ten days, which is still progress I think.
I gave up on the pushup/squats, but I restarted yesterday!
I listened maybe half the days in BiaY.
I think I just entirely gave up on the journal.

So, apparently bad goals.
New goals for the month of March:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Blog daily. I think this is still a helpful thing for me to do
\item Write music or poetry daily. I would like to do this, even if it is hard
\item Do the pushup/squat thing and stretch daily. I liked how I felt when I did this
\item Listen to BiaY Daily. I like making progress on it.
\item Reach 50000 words in my book. I'm currently at more than 20K, so this should be very doable.
\end{enumerate}
That seems pretty decent!
