\section{Draft 1}
Sorry for the sudden disappearance, but it's relevant to the post I promise.\footnote{no, this isn't some fun meta thing where I lived my life to blog better, though ooh I should try that.}
One thing that's been a positive from these crazy few years is that I haven't really gotten sick as much.
I feel like I got the flu or something every winter and spring, and I think I've maybe gotten sick twice since it began.

On the other hand, I feel like I used to bounce back from illness immediately, and now it takes me a little longer.
Maybe it's the whole \say{I don't sleep for 12 hours normally anymore} or \say{I don't eat as well anymore}\footnote{though I'm trying to again}, but I got sick over the weekend, and I felt a lot sicker than I feel like I remember I used to normally feel when I was ill.
I'm very much on the mend now, but it meant that I didn't really have the mental or emotional capacity to really do much of anything, especially writing a blog post.
