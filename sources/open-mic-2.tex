\section{Draft 1}
Like my \href{open-mic.html}{last post on the topic}, I missed writing and uploading a post last night because I was at an open mic.
Unlike last time, though, I was performing at this one.
A friend from my graduate program and I have played at this open mic twice now, and it was a great time.

The vibes are really nice at the place.
The crowd is generally supportive but not hyperfocused on the music.\footnote{that is, they are still drinking and chatting at their tables.}
The other performers were almost universally better than me, but incredibly supportive.\footnote{they cheered louder than the people I brought.}
So yeah! I'm excited to keep going.
