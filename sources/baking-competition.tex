\section{\href{baking-competition.html}{Baking Competition}}
First Published: 2018 November 23
\section{Draft 1 (21 Nov)}
I was informed last night that in a little over a month, I'll be participating in a baking competition.
Now, as I've mentioned more than once, I like to make food.
I've also mentioned that I like competition, so this should be a great thing for me.

But, here comes the hard part: what do I make?
My initial idea was to make my chocolate toffee cookies,\footnote{as mentioned in \href{toffee-recipe.html}{this post}} but with a few modifications.

I've begun watching youtube food videos, and I understand wholly why people watch them.
It's super entertaining and informative.
A few highlights from what I've learned is that you can brown butter to add more flavour\footnote{yes I'm British now, deal with it} to food, and that you can add espresso powder to chocolate foods to make them taste more deep.

So, I'd planned on browning the butter in the cookies,\footnote{not in the toffee, since that's already browned} and adding some coffee in as well.
However, I also realized that I had chicory coffee at home, and wondered if that might not be a better profile, since it would be a little nuttier.

But, as a wise friend helped me realize \say{Good cookies are good. Great cookies are good. Awesome cookies are great.}
What he meant was that people tend not to discriminate too finely between different levels of cookie.
I agreed, and so thought about what else I could make.

Bread was eliminated for much the same reason, because there's not a huge difference in how a normal person perceives a good to great loaf, and I don't know that I can make an excellent loaf 100\% of the time.\footnote{especially since I'll be in a scary kitchen}
So, since the challenge began with someone's banana bread recipe, it was suggested I do that.

But, banana bread for me has always just been a good comfort food.
So, like with cookies, it's not something that can really show how amazing I am at baking.

Then, I remembered that I used to make a recipe called \href{http://catcora.com/recipes/desserts/chocolate-budino/}{\say{Chocolate Budino.}}
It's effectively a chocolate pudding cake, and, when served warm, acts somewhat like a chocolate lava cake.
So, as above, I may add in browned butter and espresso to make it more rich, but that seemed like a good way to distinguish myself.

Then the options arose again.
I could either make it small, as in a cupcake mold, or large, the size of a 8" cake or so.\footnote{yes an 8" cake is 8", but it made sense that the time}
There are advantages and disadvantages to both, so I was not sure which I'll do.

Then the question became one of serving the cake.
I could present it on its own, but that lacks a lot of the cool factor that we love when we bake.
So, I decided I'd add some sort of side to the dessert.\footnote{no I'm not taking it too seriously, I just refuse to lose}

I like fruit, especially strawberries, so I decided I'd do strawberries on the side.
But, then the question becomes how, and I was unsure.

Next, people suggested ice cream.
But, I'm trying to showcase my talents, so buying ice cream is out.
Making ice cream is a pain, and no-churn ice cream is fake.

So, I realized what I really wanted was something creamy.
Hmmm, whipped cream.

I thought about what I tended to associate with chocolate and strawberries, and it's mint.
So, I thought I'd do a fresh mint whipped cream, and serve that with mint and strawberry.

Then the question returned to the size.
As another friend pointed out, a cake sized budino would be more easily decorated, as well as looking more professional.\footnote{man I have no clue how to write the words there. Do you say \say{as well as} and then a gerund? or a regular verb? or what}
So, I realized that I could do a full size cake, cut a nice slice out of it, and have a strawberry on the top, along with a sprig of mint and the cream.
I'm still not sure where the cream will go, but I envision it along the side of the cake slice, with the cake topped with some sort of decorative strawberry flower.
Maybe the cream could have a slice leaning on it with the mint sprig.

So, in conclusion, I try way too hard.
