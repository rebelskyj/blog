First Published: 2018 November 27
\section{Draft 1}
Tonight, I had the wonderful opportunity to see \textit{Bat Out Of Hell} at the Dominion Theatre.
It was an odd show for a lot of reasons.

Plot wise, it definitely felt like Peter Pan.
There were some fun fourth wall breaks, including the orchestra coming out with broken instruments.
It was really fun, especially as a sing-along.
