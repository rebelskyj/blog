First Published: 2019 January 31
\section{Draft 1}
My role model for this writing\footnote{tries to} reflect each month on the month, especially in relation to writing.
This month for writing was interesting.

I failed to write the most days I've ever done.
Conversely, I still have an average of one post a day.

I also set a goal of writing a sonnet every day.
While I did not quite reach the goal, I did write\footnote{I think} 24 sonnets, which is good enough for me.
I learned that I can write about the everyday events in my life, which is nice.

Next month, I will try to write the posts more consistently for their day.
I will also try to write a limerick a day, as that should hopefully be less time consuming.\footnote{although I have gotten better at writing sonnets}
