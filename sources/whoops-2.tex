\section{Draft 1}
Last week I said that I would be using today's post to write about Chapter One of a book.
But, I forgot it at work when I went home for the day, so no post today.
Apparently \href{whoops.html}{last time} a whoops moment was the focus of the blog I deleted something.
At least this isn't that!
