\section{Draft 1}
As many of you know, I dive.
I also dive poorly very often.
Most of the time this is me making a mistake in the air\footnote{generally forgetting to think} and hitting the water hard.

Once, it was hitting the board.
Today, it was my foot slipping on an inward dive.
As a result, my chest and leg are now scratched up.
On the plus side, it did spark a moral dilemma among some friends.\footnote{it's a long story}
