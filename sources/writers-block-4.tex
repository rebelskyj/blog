\section{Draft 1}
It's really interesting where I do and don't get writer's block.
In the exams I need to write for my program, I get them constantly.
In the novel I'm writing for fun but also have committed to in some respects, I get it occasionally.
In this blog, which I've done for longer, I get it often.
And, in the random short story prompt I was given and inspired to create a tumblr for, I apparently don't have it.
Weird.

Anyways, writer's block is such a weird concept when you stop to think about it.
There are infinite ways that I can combine letters to create meaning, and infinitely many ways to make nonsense.
But, when I have writer's block, I can't even think of a way to write nonsense.
It's really fun to think about.

That also, as I read it, may be a good solution to writer's block.
Just keyboard mash until you see a word and hope it sparks something.
If I get this again, I may try it.
