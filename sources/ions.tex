\section{Draft 1}
Today we got our ion experiment running!\footnote{asterisk maybe needed}
I had a plan for what I might write about here, talking about delays and future projects, but something came up and so I didn't write this earlier.
It's now late, so this is as long as I will write today.\footnote{hopefully I'll use the drafting tools to make another draft tomorrow}
