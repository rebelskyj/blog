\section{Draft 1}
Tonight I had a lovely date which included visiting a local ice skating rink.
It was absolutely incredible\footnote{as all of my time with her is} to try ice skating again for what I'm pretty sure is the first time in more than a decade.
That's something that I find I often see in the new year: I try things again that I haven't for ages and find that it's at least as fun now as it was then.
