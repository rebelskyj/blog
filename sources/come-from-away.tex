First Published: 2022 November 24

\section{Draft 1}
Last night\footnote{because this is being written a day late} I had the chance to watch a fantastic musical called \say{Come From Away.}
It's about the small Newfoundland town that suddenly nearly doubled in town on September 11, 2001 when planes were diverted to its airport.
I really enjoyed the musical, because most of the music was clearly coming from the Newfoundland folk tradition, and there were certainly\footnote{to my ears at least} a number of nods to that great Canadian songsmith Stan Rogers, with his driving bass and rock influences.

The musical was interesting, especially in the way that it interspersed the serious with the profound with the funny and lighthearted.
It gave me, at least, a similar feeling to what it must have felt like to be running without sleep for days in the midst of tragedy and love.

The mix wasn't the best, but that could also just be where we were sitting.
It was a fantastic show!
