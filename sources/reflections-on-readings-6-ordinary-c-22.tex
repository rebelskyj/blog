Luke 6:21B: \say{  Blessed are you who are now weeping,
                        for you will laugh.}

\section{Draft 1}
This week is a beatitudes week, which is really nice.
Unlike many weeks, I don't really see the readings totally differently this year.
I guess the one that is sticking out to me most right now is the one addressed towards the weeping, saying that they will laugh.
As the priest in the sermon tonight pointed out, this is not saying that it is better to be hungry or weeping, but rather a consolation that joy will enter our lives again, even if it isn't there now.
Some days I really should just write that down at the beginning of my day so I'm forced to remember.
