\section{Draft 1}
Today I made pizza with some friends.
It came out really well, which is always satisfying.
And, I reaffirmed my knowledge that I really don't need help making bread anymore.

I tried to follow a recipe that was given to me, but realized I had nothing to measure water or flour with.
I guestimated my 12 oz. of water, then just decided that I knew the right texture, so could use flour to that result.
I put in too much oil and sugar, but no one seemed to notice or care.
So, turns out I can make pizza dough.
That's nice, and I might never actually follow a bread recipe again.
We'll see what happens
