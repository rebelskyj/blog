First Published: 2022 July 9

Pre reading note: I meant to write this last night but was too tired. Whoops.
\section{Draft 1}
I had the opportunity to go to Venite Adoremus, a holy hour of adoration for young adults in my diocese.
It was a really great opportunity, and it reminded me that I really should go to adoration more often.

After the hour, there was a social event, which was also really nice.
It's great to meet people around my age.
