Psalm 117:1 \say{Praise the LORD, all you nations!

Extol him, all you peoples}

\section{Draft 1}
Oh boy is there a lot to talk about this week.
The theme common to all three readings was that of the Lord as Father, especially Father of All.

However, there are also other pieces to talk about.
The Second Reading was written by Paul to the Jewish people.
In it, he reminds us that, just as children may not understand the reason for punishment or discipline from a just parent, so too do we sometimes misunderstand the reasons for suffering in our own lives.
