\section{Draft 1}
Sometimes I forget why reading is both a great and terrible idea for me to do.
On the great side, I get to expand my creativity and whatever other benefits reading has.
On the terrible side, I lose track of time.
I got home today at around six, and told myself I had plenty of time to do the many tasks that I should do in a day.
Instead, I read until it was time for me to sleep.
C'est la vie.
