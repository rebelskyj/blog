\section{\href{twelfth-night-23.html}{Twelfth Night Review}}
First Posted: 2023 November 18
\section{Draft 1}
Tonight I saw the same version of Twelfth Night that I saw \href{twelfth-night.html}{just over five years ago.}
Of course, the cast and location were completely different.
I didn't think that I remembered any part of the show, but every time I heard one of the\footnote{many} musical numbers, it was like I was transported back to my time in London.
The sense of deja vu was almost overwhelming at times.

Much like my musings in those days, I find that it's late enough I have nothing else to say.
Tomorrow I'll do a comparative review, but tonight I must sleep.
