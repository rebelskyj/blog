\section{Draft 1}
For a variety of reasons,\footnote{my candidacy exam, Lent, etc} I haven't been going to open mics since around February.
I went again tonight, and I forgot just how much fun they are.
I got to sing a song that I've been working on for a while,\footnote{Treaty by Leonard Cohen} and at the prompting of a friend I sang a great song with another friend.\footnote{Till Forever Falls Apart by Ashe and Finneas (also it bothers me that until becomes till not til)}
The friend who made the recommendation is also a fantastic musician and was willing to take requests.
It's really fun singing Three is a Magic Number\footnote{from School House Rock} with other adults, especially when everyone is over trying to look cool.

I'm really excited to make open mics a regular part of my schedule again.
