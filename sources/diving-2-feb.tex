\section{Draft 1}
Today, all three of the men attempted to end the meet with the same dive, 405C.
One of us\footnote{not me} has thrown the dive at numerous other meets, so it went well, as was to be expected.
One of us\footnote{also not me} had never attempted this dive before, so it went better than expected.
One of us\footnote{me!} had tried it a few times before, so the dive went as mediocrely as to be expected.

In addition, I attempted 205 again.
This time I tried it twice, the first was ok, the second one went way over!
I almost threw a triple.
That's exciting.

Otherwise, the meet went pretty well.
I had some dives I've never done quite as well, and a lot of dives I've done as well before.
