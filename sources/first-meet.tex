\section{Draft 1}
Today was my first dive meet of the year, and also my first meet since studying abroad.
Interestingly, I performed as well as I've ever done in the past.
It may just be that the judge\footnote{don't ask} was hoping to make me feel better about myself, which is likely the answer.
We'll find out in around two weeks.
