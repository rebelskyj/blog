\section{Draft 1}
As I mentioned \href{nanowrimo.html}{earlier}, I'm doin NaNoWriMo this year.
But, I'm also competitive with myself.
So, around four days in, I figured out how I'd challenge myself.
Each day, I'll not only write more,\footnote{like a try hard} but also increase the rate with which I'm writing more.
Since I didn't think ahead, that means that each day I need to write more than 3\% more than I did the day before.
So, by the end of the month, I'll have around five thousand words to write a day.

On the bright side, if I can do it, I'll have certainly made papers in the future much easier.
