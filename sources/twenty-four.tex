\section{\href{twenty-four-html}{24 for Twenty Four}}
First Published: 2022 August 22

\section{Draft 7: 26 July 2023, added new notes }
This year I chose not to participate in a yearly tradition titled \textit{n} for \textit{n}.\footnote{e.g. 21 for 21, 22 for 22}
While what that initially meant is unimportant, what's important is that I've decided to reincorporate the name.
Instead of meaning whatever it used to,\footnote{truthfully, who can remember what it meant? /s} I'm going to try to learn 24 new skills while I'm 24.
These can be actual skills, like an instrument or language, or things I just had never done and so had no way to do them.
I'll also include skills I once had but no longer do, such as picking up an instrument I've forgotten or doing some athletic feat that I needed to retrain for.
I'll keep this list updated with them, and may remove them depending on how things go.

\begin{enumerate}
\item As I've alluded too \href{open-mic-2.html}{before}, I've started playing at open mics.
I'm going to put the skills of \say{playing with a partner} and \say{regularly doing an open mic}\footnote{I'm not counting the ones I did in college because the only people who came to them were open-mic performers (open mic-performers?), and I never prepared for them} together, since each is really only half of a new skill.\footnote{I've done lots of me singing with a piano and the open mic as mentioned above} \footnote{1 October}I've also started playing with a band now, so together it's for sure at least one skill.\footnote{also at the open mic last week (26 September) we had a guitarist that we'd only run the songs with once and a drummer who just came on stage for our set, so that's super cool! (Actually, the two of them added a ton to our musicality)}
\item I \href{performing-a-song.html}{performed an original song} at an open mic!
\item I learned how to do \href{accordion-repair.html}{basic accordion repair!}
\item I \href{running-2.html}{was able to run five miles!} 
\item I \href{bagpipes.html}{played bagpipes at a friend's wedding!}
\item I \href{celtic-knots.html}{learned how to add dragon-motifs to my Celtic knots}
\item I \href{nanowrimo-4.html}{successfully did NaNoWriMo}!
\item I started self-publishing a webnovel!\footnote{which is currently ranked number 760ish/43000some on the site. sadly ratings drop me lower now}
\item I \href{writathon-23-april.html}{successfully finished a Writathon}!\footnote{which isn't that much different from NaNoWriMo, but I'm counting it}
\item I wrote two books at once!\footnote{which included writing over 80000 words in the span of about a month}
\item I passed my candidacy exam!
\item I've been towed now!\footnote{Which, in retrospect, maybe doesn't deserve an exclamation point.}
\item I gave double red blood!
\item I learned how to do Tunisian crochet!\footnote{to at least a very low extent}
\item I presented my research at the state capital building!\footnote{which I did before posting this, whoops!}
\item I took a Cumbiya class!\footnote{and did absolutely terribly, but that was half the fun!}
\item I taught religious education!\footnote{wow I completely spaced that this is a thing that I did...}
\item I went on a blind date!\footnote{which was fun!}
\item I went swimming again!\footnote{I didn't really want to include this, because it's hard for me to admit that I'm not a swimmer anymore. But, it has been well over two years since my last swim I think.}
\item I started using a fountain pen\footnote{which I hopefully will muse about after this. (hmm muse versus blog is something I should revisit)}
\item I went on a service trip!\footnote{shockingly I think my first one ever.}
\item I went to Michagin!\footnote{I also think for the first time, but at least in my memory the first time}
\item I published a whole book.\footnote{I mean I guess I had done that when I finished the Writathon, but this one didn't just do two thirds of its plot in the final chapter.}
\end{enumerate}

Thanks for following me on this journey!
I'm hopeful that this will let me reflect on the passage of time more intentionally.
I'm also hopeful that it will mean that next summer, when I\footnote{likely} have far too few entries, I'll use some time to branch out and try new things.

Note 26 July: 
I've apparently done twenty three new things this year, which is basically where I want to be.
I need to do a single new thing before I turn twenty five, which should be doable.\footnote{though it would be funny to have \say{lived a year as a twenty four year old}, I will refrain.}
If I do more things that feel notable, I suppose that I can get rid of some items I don't feel strongly about/combine them.\footnote{like Writathon and Nanowrimo. They're basically the same entry I think.}

I'm hopeful that this will let me reflect on the passage of time more intentionally.
I'm also hopeful that it will mean that next summer, when I\footnote{likely} have far too few entries, I'll use some time to branch out and try new things.

Note 3 June: 
I've apparently done eighteen new things this year, which is two or three\footnote{hey that lowered! then again, most of the tasks I added I had done before 15 May, so this musing is also good as a reflective tool I suppose} fewer new tasks than I would like to be at now.
My standards are absolutely dropping here, but that is probably ok.
After all, I am generally ok with who I am as a person, so remaining myself isn't anything too bad.


\section{Draft 5: 15 May 2023, added new notes}
This year I chose not to participate in a yearly tradition that was titled \textit{n} for \textit{n}.\footnot{e.g. 21 for 21, 22 for 22}

Thus far I really only have one, but I'm hopeful to add more.

\item I've been towed now!\footnote{Which, in retrospect, maybe doesn't deserve an exclamation point.}
\item I gave double red blood!\footnote{which I added after posting Draft 5, but I doubt anyone read it in the thirty seconds between when it went up and my correction.}
\end{enumerate}

Thanks for following me on this journey!
I'm hopeful that this will let me reflect on the passage of time more intentionally.
I'm also hopeful that it will mean that next summer, when I\footnote{likely} have far too few entries, I'll use some time to branch out and try new things.

Note 15 May: 
I've apparently done thirteen\footnote{ope that's an unlucky number} new things this year, which is five\footnote{interestingly, the first time I wrote today's draft, that number much higher} fewer than I would like to be at now.
Either I need to start lowering my standards for what counts as new or I need to start doing more.

Note 1 December: I am now slightly behind which is fine.
Now it's time to start doing things outside of my comfort zone I guess.

Note 26 October: I'm currently even more\footnote{isn't it weird how more slightly means less?} slightly ahead of schedule for skills which is fun! 
I haven't had to use this list as motivation yet, but probably soon.
