\section{Draft 1}
Directions for this attempt at the chocolate cake recipe I used to compete in the competition series.\footnote{I'm not linking them because they're a bit cringe}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Preheat Oven to 350F
\item Beat together:
\begin{itemize}
\item 3 Large Eggs
\item 3 Large Egg Yolks
\item 100 grams sugar
\item 1 Capful Vanilla
\item Cinnamon
\end{itemize}
\item Melt 1.5 Sticks butter together until frothy,\footnote{Approx 230F} add 8 oz chocolate to that
\item Mix well, until chocolate is dissolved
\item Combine with liquids and 25g flour.
\item Pour into well-greased tin
\item Bake until edges pulling from side and middle seems done (8 minutes for cupcake, 16 for cake pan)
\item Let cool most of the way
\item Invert on a plate before fully cool
\end{enumerate}

Why am I baking this, you might ask.
Mostly because tomorrow is the last day of Ordinary Time, which feels like a good time to celebrate.
That, and I haven't baked in a few weeks which is sad.
