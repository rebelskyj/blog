\section{Draft 1}
Tonight I got to see the local University's production of Sweeney Todd.
It was performed by the operatic portion of the univeristy, which is another point in defense of my belief that the two genres are one.

It was done fantastically, and every member of the show did incredibly.
As one of the friends I saw it with commented on the Judge's song, \say{he did such a good job I don't want to clap for him.}
It does mean that this week has been filled with insufficient sleep, but such is the life.
