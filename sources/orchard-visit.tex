\section{Draft 1}
Today, I got to go to an orchard!
It was very fun.
I learned that plums grow on trees,\footnote{it's not that I didn't think they did, it's just that I didn't think about it} British people call zucchini\footnote{or cucumber? I'm still not entirely convinced that they're different} something other than that,\footnote{nope, I have no clue what it was} and I can climb a tree\footnote{and get caught in it multiple times} without getting anything on a set of dress clothes.
Also, pear juice is great.

Only downside, I'm sleepy now.
Have a great night y'oall!
