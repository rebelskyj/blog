\section{Draft 1}
Today was\footnote{is?} the annual 10/10 celebration at Grinnell College. It's weird being further away from it than I ever have been before. Apparently in years past, students in my program would host an event for the Grinnell students in Europe. That didn't happen this year. I wonder if that's another 10/10 tradition that's gone forever.
