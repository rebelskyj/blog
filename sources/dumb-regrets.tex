\section{Draft 1}
As some of you may know, I dive.
And, as a result of this, I've learned the numbering system for diving.
It's fairly straightforward.
For example, 103 means front one and a half.
Each time the final number increases by one, the number of half-rotations does as well.
So, 104 is front double, and so on.
Now, this brings us to a topic of debate among my teammates and I.
Should front 5 and one half be 111 or 1011?
While in London, I heard that one of my teammates knew someone who threw the dive, so I could've asked what the number was.
But, I forgot, and now don't know the number.
However, some research I've never tried to do before now suggests that the answer is \href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27418210}{1011}, which is fine, just wrong.
