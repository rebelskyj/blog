\section{Draft 1}
Hooray! I finished NaNoWriMo yesterday, nearly a week ahead of time.
Sadly, there are still two achievements which require me to continue writing these next few days, so I will continue to do so.

\href{nanowrimo-3.hmtl}{Last time} I was curious if the goal would be 0 after finishing the goal, which is somewhat true,
Before I had put an increase in my wordcount today, the goal was zero.
After doing so, the goal was 40, which is interesting.
My writing continued to go more quickly throughout the month, which was nice.
