First Published: 2022 December 24

\section{Draft 1}
As I\footnote{hopefully} said, Saturdays are now for reflecting on a week of species counterpoint progress.
This week has gone well!
I managed to do it all six days.

After day three, I decided\footnote{realized?} that I wasn't gaining much from the first species, so I decided to move on to second species.
I think it might be fun to switch on day three of each week, though I'm not totally sure why.

Anyways, I'm enjoying it and getting better at it.
I'm excited to see if it transfers to the quartet I'm writing tomorrow.
