\section{Draft 1}
It's been a little over a month since m last posting about open mics.
I've played by myself most weeks since then\footnote{the band played one week}, and it's weird knowing just how much of a difference practicing makes.
I still am not good at accordion, but I at least now know what songs go over better with the crowd.\footnote{songs that are faster generally or at least more rhythmic}
