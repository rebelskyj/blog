Luke 3:22 : \say{ and the holy Spirit descended upon him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven, \nsay{You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.}}

\section{Draft 1}

As the Christmas season ends, I think it's wonderful that we are presented with the images of forgiveness and rebirth.
