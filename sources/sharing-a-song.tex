\section{Draft 1}
In October of 2018, I apparently wrote about \href{writing-a-song.html}{writing a song}.
Despite the fact that I've done a lot of composing, I realize now that most of it happened in the dark ages.\footnote{i.e. the period of time between stopping and restarting this blog.}
As a result, I don't know that I've talked about writing a song at all.

Anyways, I wrote most of a song, which I've shared about previously.\footnote{I don't remember where, so no links}
I shared the song with the person I play open mics with yesterday, and he liked it.\footnote{or said he did, at least}
It's really scary to share things you make with people around you, so I'm glad for his reaction.
Now I just have to finish it and muster the courage to share it with people at an open mic.
