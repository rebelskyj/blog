\section{Draft 1}
Today is Friday.
It's also the Friday ending what my host university calls \say{Reading Week.}
As class ended last week, my professor made a note of that, before commenting that little to no reading happens during reading week.

I planned on reading during reading week.
But, Monday turned into Tuesday turned into today, and I did no studying.
Somehow, I even read less of my pleasure reading than I tend to do.
But, I did destress, which is important, since I didn't realize how ragged I'd been running myself.
So, I guess I read the right amount?
