Jeremiah 17:7: \say{ Blessed are those who trust in the LORD; the LORD will be their trust}

\section{Draft 1}
Today's readings speak about trusting the Lord, for better and for worse.
Should we trust in the Lord, we are told that we will be cared for in times of sorrow.
However, we are also told that those times of sorrow will come
If we are weeping now, laughter will come to us.\footnote{Luke 6:21B}
If we are laughing now, however, we will weep later.\footnote{Luke 6:25B}

Now, this isn't to say that we should be in a perpetual state of weeping, with hopes that our joy will come later.\footnote{though that would make a convincing argument for instilling Catholic guilt}
Rather, we are to remember that the good in our lives will comes to an end, just as the bad will.
