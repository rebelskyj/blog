\section{Draft 1}
As I mentioned \href{baking-competition.html}{before}, in a few weeks I'll be competing in a baking competition.
So, today I tried making the recipe for the first time.
Reviews were generally positive, though many commented that the flavor was almost too strong.
Given that I remember the recipe having a strong chocolate flavor before browning the butter and adding coffee, that would make sense.
So, next time I make it, I'll have to also try adding on the whipped cream and strawberries.

Right now, I need to think of a way to lighten the dish, as most reviewers found it too strong.
I hope that adding the whipped cream will be enough to lighten it.
Tomorrow should tell me.
