<p>Today, I had the wonderful opportunity to see <em>Caroline, or Change</em> at the Playhouse Theatre. There were some pieces of the show that I really loved, like the long scene about how much the world will miss JFK, and the dinner scene, where I realized that if my paternal grandfather had been alive at a Hanukkah table, he might have expressed similar sentiments.</p>
<p>But, overall the show fell flat for me. Partially this is my fault, because when two singers are singing different words, I can’t hear either. Since the show was written very operatically, that meant that I couldn’t understand much of what went on at all. I also didn’t love the melodies that the composer used, but that’s neither here nor there.</p>
