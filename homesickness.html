<p>First Posted: 2018 October 11</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>One of my biggest concerns about studying abroad was how homesick I might get. For those of you unfamiliar,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> I’ve lived my entire life in the same beautiful city<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> of 8000 or so people. This semester, I decided that I would spend a semester of my life 4100 miles away, in a city of many millions.</p>
<p>I was expecting some culture shock, which I wrote about <a href="small-changes.html">earlier</a>. But, I was also expecting to get homesick, if only because all of my friends told me I’d feel that way.</p>
<p>Now, the only time I’ve ever been truly homesick was, strangely enough, at a camp at Grinnell College.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> But, I’d never spent so much time away from family, friends, and familiar surroundings. And, the first night, I worried a lot about how homesick I might feel, to the point that I began to feel a little homesick.</p>
<p>But, in the 43 days that have followed,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> that’s the only homesickness I’ve felt. I’ve still got another 70 or so, but I don’t think it’s going to suddenly come on. So, yay! No homesick for me.</p>
