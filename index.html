<h1 id="dance-nation-review"><a href="dance-nation.html">Dance Nation Review</a></h1>
<p>Today, I had the wonderful opportunity to watch Clare Barron’s <em>Dance Nation</em> at the Almeida Theatre. The show follows a U13 dance squad as it prepares for national qualifying tournaments. What follows is a review.</p>
<h1 id="draft-3">Draft 3</h1>
<p>The show speaks about the sexualization and sexuality of young women. As I share no part of that experience, my review will focus on other aspects of the show.</p>
<p>As many of you know, I was a techie<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> in high school. Perhaps because of that, or perhaps because something about the medium of live theatre really allows the technical aspects to shine forth, I tend to focus a lot more on the technical theatre aspect than the acting. My reviews<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> will also likely focus on these.</p>
<p>When we are first allowed on stage, we see a curtain in the murky realm between translucence and transparancy. We can barely make out a mirrored wall behind us, and lights running up the seams. When the show opens, the curtain drops. I was struck by the paneling of the stage. Mirrors made up the entire back wall, with lights strung between each. Throughout the show, the use of the lights as a way to demarcate different areas of the stage and different characters was masterful. However, the panels do not remain mirrors. The first piece of the show that struck me was the paneling of the stage.</p>
<p>Throughout the show, the panels turn and twist about, becoming anything from doors, to black glitter decoration, to a wolf’s head, to a bathroom stall. The use of the panels as entries and exits, as a way to bridge and break scenes, and, at the end, as a way to recognize the disjointed nature of both the show and life is fantastic.</p>
<p>The lighting of the show is also incredibly helpful for setting and moving the scenes along, as well as making the minimal set feel larger. When Luke is on the car ride home with his mother, the moon in the upper right of the stage tells us of the long day he’s had, and connects us to the other dancers, who each have their own memories of the night. As the drive continues, orange lights flow by their faces, reminding the audience of their movement. When Zuzu has a breakdown, the lights become harsher and harsher until her realization comes through.</p>
<p>Continuing to mess with the set, the show did a wonderful job of playing with set as prop and prop as set. Actors tended to carry in the set pieces, or pieces that they worked with remained a part of the show. Always in the wings of the stage were the detritus of a dance studio, reminding that it’s never far away, especially in the minds of the dancers. As the show progresses, the stage becomes more and more cluttered, just as the depth of the characters’ experiences do.</p>
<p>A final note about the set, as means to transition into the acting, all along what is meant to be the ceiling of the room are trophies from dance competitions past. In my experience as an athlete, leaving mementos of victory where they are always visible is meant one of two ways. Either the coach wants to say “you’re a part of a program with past success, and with hard work you can be a part of that too,” or “winning is all that matters. The teams that aren’t up here don’t belong in our memories because they were a failure as a team and as people.”<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> This show chose to take the second approach, and took it to the comical extreme that some coaches take it. Not only does the coach point out the one year with no trophy by saying no one remembers them, he then mentions the next year, where a dancer was recruited to become a professional. One of the panels turns and shows us a shrine dedicated to the dancer and all of the dancers chant her name. This is the first of many times throughout the show that the coach and dancers talk about how winning<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a> is the only important aspect of dance. To quote a common sports saying, “winning isn’t everything, it’s the only thing.” What the show quietly points out, however, is that there is a constant culling of winners. No one the rest of the star’s team. Slowly but surely, in memory and in action, the weak are culled. Only the strong remain.</p>
<p>In the first scene, a dancer gets injured and is never heard from again. Near the end of the show, another dancer makes a mistake and quits as a result. These actions, along with monologues, showcase a dangerous aspect of not only children’s athletics, but also of society. Weakness and failure are not opportunities to grow, but rather signs of being inherently inability. And, since the weak get culled, any mistake means you no longer belong.</p>
<p>All in all though, it was a very enjoyable show.</p>

As an athlete, leaving trophies where they are always visible has in my experience been meant in one of two ways. It either is left to say:“we have a history of hard work and success. Keep that alive,” or “these trophies represent the years we remember and care about. The years without trophies are failures, and the athletes are too.” This show chose to take the second approach, and took it to an almost comical extreme. Not only does the coach point out the one year with no trophy by saying no one remembers them, he then mentions the next year, where a dancer was recruited to become a professional. One of the panels turns and shows us a shrine dedicated to the dancer.

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>The first piece of the show that struck me was the paneling of the stage. When the curtain drops to begin the show, the back wall is composed of mirror panels. Throughout the show, the panels are turned and become anything from doors, to black glitter decoration, to a wolf’s head, to a bathroom stall. Throughout the show, the use of the panels as entries and exits, as a way to bridge and break scenes, and, at the end, as a way to recognize the disjointed nature of the show and life is fantastic.</p>
<p>The lighting of the show is also incredibly helpful for setting and moving the scenes along. When Luke is on the car ride home with his mother, the moon in the upper right of the stage tells us of the long day he’s had. As the drive continues, orange lights flow by their faces, showing the audience how they’re moving through time.</p>
<p>In terms of the show itself, the show is set in a dance academy featuring the parts of youth athletics I was so incredibly fortunate to miss out on. These preteens are being told that their future success in life depends wholly on how well they perform at a single show. The coach<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref"><sup>8</sup></a> reinforce the idea that it really doesn’t matter whether you’re having fun.<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref"><sup>9</sup></a> All that matters is being the best and winning. Weakness isn’t tolerated, and the weak are culled out.</p>
<p>From the first scene, where a dancer gets injured and is never heard from again, through to the end, where a dancer makes a mistake and, as a result, quits dance forever, the idea of mistakes as being reflective of character flaws, and that character flaws (and by extension, those who hold them) should be hidden.</p>
<p>All along what is meant to be the ceiling of the room, there are trophies from dance competitions. As an athlete, leaving trophies where they are always visible can be meant in one of two ways. It can either be: “we have a history of success, and y’all are going to be a part of it,” or “we only care about you if you win.” As you might guess, this show chose the second approach, and took it to an almost comical extreme. Not only does the coach point out the one year with no trophy by saying no one remembers them, he then mentions the next year, where a dancer was recruited to become a professional. He fully tells both the dancers and the crowd that the only important thing about dance is being the best. Even the rest of the famous dancer’s group is forgotten. Only the strong remain.</p>
<p>Returning to painting the scene, the show did a wonderful job of playing with set as prop and prop as set. Actors tended to carry in the set pieces, or pieces that they worked with remained a part of the show. Always in the wings of the stage were the detritus of a dance studio, reminding that it’s never far away.</p>
<p>All in all, it was a very enjoyable show.</p>

<h1 id="draft-two">Draft Two</h1>
<p>At first glance, today’s title may seem like a non sequitur.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> What do pierogi<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> have to do with the ukulele?<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> No, this title isn’t<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a> written as an intentional non sequitur to spark my creative energies. Rather, I realized that the same thought processes inform my choice of both making pierogi and pronouncing ukulele.</p>
<p>To understand what I mean by that, at the bottom of today’s essay are two pierogi recipes.<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"><sup>5</sup></a> One of them is a recipe I found online,<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref"><sup>6</sup></a> and the other is the recipe I used last time I made pierogi.<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref"><sup>7</sup></a> As a bonus, I also include the gluten free pierogi dough recipe I used.<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>If you’ve read the recipes, you might notice a few differences between the two recipes.<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref"><sup>9</sup></a> The biggest difference to me is in the dough.<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref"><sup>10</sup></a> They use both sour cream and water in their dough, while I don’t use either. My reason for this comes from my formative years, when I learned to make pasta. According to my teacher,<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref"><sup>11</sup></a> Italian pasta dough<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref"><sup>12</sup></a> only contains salt, egg, flour, and oil.</p>
<p>Since that dough has worked for everything I ever needed a dough for,<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref"><sup>13</sup></a> I never felt the need to use other pasta doughs.<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref"><sup>14</sup></a> So, when I made my pierogi, I just made dough the way I always do.<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Now, by this point you might be asking what making dumplings has to do with the pronunciation of ukulele.<a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref"><sup>16</sup></a> To me, they’re two reflections of the same universal truth: people adapt everything they learn to fit into their prior knowledge and experiences.</p>
<p>In IPA<a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref"><sup>17</sup></a> notation, the word ukulele is pronounced<a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote-ref"><sup>18</sup></a> /?uku?ll/, which contrasts to the SAE<a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote-ref"><sup>19</sup></a> pronunciation of /ju?k?lejli/. This is due to the nature of word movement through languages. When a word is assumed into a new language, it<a href="#fn20" id="fnref20" class="footnote-ref"><sup>20</sup></a> change its pronunciation to align to the new tongues phonological rules. In Hawaiian, there is no schwa,<a href="#fn21" id="fnref21" class="footnote-ref"><sup>21</sup></a> while SAE uses the schwa almost exclusively in unstressed syllables. Additionally, SAE almost never begins words with vowel /u/<a href="#fn22" id="fnref22" class="footnote-ref"><sup>22</sup></a>. So, when the Hawaiian word entered the SAE lexicon, the /j/<a href="#fn23" id="fnref23" class="footnote-ref"><sup>23</sup></a> was added, to make it align with the rules of the language.</p>
<p>Now, both of these changes to the word are fine and natural, at least to me.<a href="#fn24" id="fnref24" class="footnote-ref"><sup>24</sup></a> But, I’ve heard and seen complaints about the both how to pronounce ukulele, and, indirectly about how to make pierogi. To be specific, I’ve been told that the way I pronounce the word “ukulele” is wrong, since the word is pronounced differently in the language of origin. Additionally, there are many people who feel that changing a culture’s recipe<a href="#fn25" id="fnref25" class="footnote-ref"><sup>25</sup></a> is wrong.<a href="#fn26" id="fnref26" class="footnote-ref"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>To me, both of those erase the idea of positive change, which is makes the world beautiful and exciting. Should I stop calling what I make pierogi because I don’t use an “authentic” recipe?<a href="#fn27" id="fnref27" class="footnote-ref"><sup>27</sup></a> Should I try to relearn the phonological system of my native tongue to accommodate a single word?<a href="#fn28" id="fnref28" class="footnote-ref"><sup>28</sup></a> I personally don’t think so, and that’s where today’s title comes. Both the way I make pierogi and the way I pronounce ukulele come from the background and mental connections I made before encountering the idea.</p>
<h1 id="draft-one">Draft One</h1>
<p>At first glance, the title may seem like a non sequitur.<a href="#fn29" id="fnref29" class="footnote-ref"><sup>29</sup></a> What do pierogi<a href="#fn30" id="fnref30" class="footnote-ref"><sup>30</sup></a> have to do with the ukulele?<a href="#fn31" id="fnref31" class="footnote-ref"><sup>31</sup></a> No, this title isn’t<a href="#fn32" id="fnref32" class="footnote-ref"><sup>32</sup></a> written as a non sequitur as a way to spark my creative energies. Instead, while reflecting on my recipe for pierogi, especially in context with “authentic” recipes I’ve read, it occured to me that I feel similarly about pierogi and the pronunciation of the word ukulele.</p>
<p>To understand what I mean by that, below are two pierogi recipes. One of them is the recipe I found online,<a href="#fn33" id="fnref33" class="footnote-ref"><sup>33</sup></a> and the other is the recipe I used last time I made pierogi.<a href="#fn34" id="fnref34" class="footnote-ref"><sup>34</sup></a> As a bonus, I’ll also put in the gluten free pierogi dough recipe I came up with.<a href="#fn35" id="fnref35" class="footnote-ref"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>So, you might notice a few differences between the two recipes.<a href="#fn36" id="fnref36" class="footnote-ref"><sup>36</sup></a> The biggest difference to me is in the dough. They use both sour cream and water in their dough, while I don’t use either. This mostly comes from when I first learned how to make pasta. According to the person teaching me,<a href="#fn37" id="fnref37" class="footnote-ref"><sup>37</sup></a> Italian pasta dough<a href="#fn38" id="fnref38" class="footnote-ref"><sup>38</sup></a> only has salt, egg, flour, and oil.</p>
<p>Since that dough has worked for everything I ever needed a dough for,<a href="#fn39" id="fnref39" class="footnote-ref"><sup>39</sup></a> I never felt the need to change it. So, when I made my pierogi, I just made dough the way I always do.</p>

<h1 id="recipes">Recipes</h1>
<h2 id="from-internet">From Internet</h2>
<p>For the dough:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>3-1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</p></li>
<li><p>3 large eggs</p></li>
<li><p>2 tablespoons sour cream</p></li>
<li><p>3/4 cup water</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Filling:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>2 cups mashed potatoes</p></li>
<li><p>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</p></li>
<li><p>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</p></li>
<li><p>1/2 teaspoon salt</p></li>
<li><p>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</p></li>
<li><p>1 cup grated cheddar cheese</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Since pierogi making instructions, like most dumplings, are effectively just “make dough,” “make filling,” “put filling in dough,” I elide them here.</p>
<h2 id="from-memory">From Memory</h2>
<p>For the dough:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1 egg</p></li>
<li><p>olive oil in equal amount to the volume of egg</p></li>
<li><p>sprinkle salt</p></li>
<li><p>sprinkle black pepper</p></li>
<li><p>flour to correct consistency</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For the Gluten Free Dough:<a href="#fn52" id="fnref52" class="footnote-ref"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>1 egg</p></li>
<li><p>olive oil in just under amount of egg volume</p></li>
<li><p>sprinkle salt</p></li>
<li><p>sprinkle black pepper</p></li>
<li><p>white rice flour to correct consistency</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Filling:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>5 pounds potato, peeled<a href="#fn53" id="fnref53" class="footnote-ref"><sup>53</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>1 lb cream cheese</p></li>
<li><p>1/2 pound butter</p></li>
<li><p>2 red onions</p></li>
<li><p>5 cloves garlic</p></li>
<li><p>olive oil as needed</p></li>
<li><p>sharp cheddar to taste</p></li>
<li><p>salt and pepper to taste</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To make the filling, boil the potatoes, mince garlic and fry with onion in olive oil until caramalized. Drain potatoes when soft, then add everything together, mixing well.</p>
<p>To make the dough, all ingredients but flour in a bowl, then slowly add flour until solid enough to handle. Move onto a floured workspace and add more flour until the correct consistency.</p>

<h1 id="arranging-for-bagpipe"><a href="arranging-for-bagpipe.html">Arranging for Bagpipe</a></h1>
<p>Prereading note: I definitely have far more footnotes here (59 in total, 34 in the final draft) than normal (between 1 and 17 in total, and between 1 and 10 in the final draft) in my blog thus far. I have no clue why I felt the need for so many notes while writing this post, but they feel pretty needed. Additionally, since nested footnotes are apparently so frowned upon in different style circles that my editor doesn’t support them at all, nested notes will go in (), and if I doubly nest, I’ll use other [], and will continue to add as needed.</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>This spring, I started learning the Scottish bagpipes.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> While learning the bagpipe, one of my cross-country running friends<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> asked me if I would be willing to play the (United States’) National Anthem<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> at the Grinnell team’s only home meet, the Les Duke Invite. That meet is today, and (I think) just ended at the time of my writing this post. Obviously, I was unable to be there. But, their mentioning of the idea did spark me to try to find a bagpipe arrangement for The Star-Spangled Banner.<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"><sup>5</sup></a> Initial searches were fairly fruitless, with what versions I could find sounding nothing like the anthem I knew.<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref"><sup>6</sup></a> I found a <a href="http://www.therealviperpiper.com/viewtopic.php?t=11731">forum</a> discussing this, and they concluded that the anthem is unplayable on the bagpipes.</p>
<p>Now, those of you who know me may know that I don’t take being told something is impossible well.<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref"><sup>7</sup></a> It feels like a challenge. Some of you may also know that I<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref"><sup>8</sup></a> compose music. The brilliant<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref"><sup>9</sup></a> part of my mind thought that I would be able to arrange the piece for bagpipes. Obviously,<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref"><sup>10</sup></a>that wouldn’t fit the song,<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref"><sup>11</sup></a> which requires an octave and a fifth range,<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref"><sup>12</sup></a>, and some chromatic notes.<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref"><sup>13</sup></a> But, you can always drop and raise octaves to fit a piece in. Additionally, my teacher mentioned offhandedly that there are chromatic fingerings for the bagpipe. So, I worked off of a version of the piece in the key of G.<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>There I ran into my first problem: I have no clue how to play a C natural on a bagpipe, which was required in the second half of the piece.<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref"><sup>15</sup></a> But, more importantly than that, it was centered around G,<a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref"><sup>16</sup></a> which those of you familiar with harmonics may see is dissonant to A.<a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref"><sup>17</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote-ref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>When I asked a friend of mine who plays bagpipes,<a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote-ref"><sup>19</sup></a> he told me that, in his experience, people would play the second half of the song,<a href="#fn20" id="fnref20" class="footnote-ref"><sup>20</sup></a> because the first half isn’t doable. That’s when I suddenly realized that there’s a modulation in the middle of The Star Spangled Banner.<a href="#fn21" id="fnref21" class="footnote-ref"><sup>21</sup></a> With that in mind, I transposed the end of the piece to D major, which worked pretty well.<a href="#fn22" id="fnref22" class="footnote-ref"><sup>22</sup></a> I then put the initial half back in the song.<a href="#fn23" id="fnref23" class="footnote-ref"><sup>23</sup></a> I expected some cognitive dissonance from the<a href="#fn24" id="fnref24" class="footnote-ref"><sup>24</sup></a> modulation in my version of the piece, but it was fairly minor. And, since the piece was centered around D, it fit in nicely with the harmonics of the instrument.</p>
<p>Then came to the part of arranging for bagpipe that I struggle with: adding the embellishments. The bagpipe plays a continuous note, so to break up repeated notes,<a href="#fn25" id="fnref25" class="footnote-ref"><sup>25</sup></a> small chirpy notes are played to break the sound. There are many kinds of embellishments, including grace notes,<a href="#fn26" id="fnref26" class="footnote-ref"><sup>26</sup></a>, doublings and half doublings,<a href="#fn27" id="fnref27" class="footnote-ref"><sup>27</sup></a> and many others. As you might expect from a musical tradition lasting centuries, there’s a lot of theory behind deciding what embellishments go where<a href="#fn28" id="fnref28" class="footnote-ref"><sup>28</sup></a> which I don’t know and can’t easily find only. So, I put in embellishments that I knew<a href="#fn29" id="fnref29" class="footnote-ref"><sup>29</sup></a> and looked right where they were, then tried playing through. Nothing looked or sounded horrible to me, but I also don’t know enough to know if anything I do would be horrible. So, now I have a version of the National Anthem of the United States of America that fits entirely on the bagpipe. If anyone wants it, feel free to drop me a message at <a href="mailto:flyingrebelpipes@gmail.com">flyingrebelpipes@gmail.com</a>. My only request if you end up using the piece is that you send me a recording of yourself playing it.</p>

<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>Today, I went on a riverwalk. Nominally, it was to fulfill an academic assignment. Since the assignment was vague,<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> I chose to journey between the London Aquatics Centre<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> and the River Thames.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> I found that <a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a> you can walk the entire distance from the Aquatic Centre to the Thames entirely along different rivers and streams.<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"><sup>5</sup></a> I had a great time during the walk! A part of me really wanted to go all the way to the English Chanel, but I knew that was a poor choice. For one, it would have been far longer than a 90 minute walk. Second, it’s really hard to decide where a tributary ends and where the real river<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref"><sup>6</sup></a> ends. Finally, the footpath that would have let me walk along the Thames was closed. Nonetheless, it was a great time. If you want to see my journey at 60x speed,<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref"><sup>7</sup></a> you can find it <a href="https://vimeo.com/288755224">here</a>.

It was tempting to walk to where the Thames meets the Chanel, but I was unable to for two reasons: that would have put me well over the maximum time of 90 minutes, and the footpath following the Thames was closed.</p>

<h1 id="draft-3">Draft 3</h1>
<p>I’m almost always listening to music, even if only inside my head. There’s something sublime about music’s ability to transport me from wherever I am and whatever I’m doing into a different place. Although every song doesn’t send me to the same place, or even the same place for each song, they always send me somewhere.</p>
<p>People ask me what kind of music I like<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>, and it’s a fair question. I’m a music major, I listen to a lot of music, and it’s a normal question. Nonetheless, I can only ever answer that I listen to almost everything. It’s both the most and least factual statement I can make.</p>
<p>The statement is filled with fact because there is no genre, artist, or even song that I completely refuse to see the merit of listening to. Every song has its place, and even if I don’t love every aspect of a piece<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a>, I still can recognize why its loved. Even if I can’t think why a song is loved, I can see its belonging in a situation, whether as ambiance or as transition.</p>
<p>For a very similar reason, the statement is totally devoid of fact. That is, there is no song that I always love. Songs that I love in most circumstances are unbearable in others. As much as I love soft lilting pieces, I recognize that they don’t belong in most people’s pregame<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> playlists. And, as much as I love heavy electronic beats, I understand that most people don’t use them as lullabies<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Even If I don’t like a song though, I always prefer music to its absence, which may be one of my defining traits. If given the option between music or no music, there are nearly<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"><sup>5</sup></a> no situations wherein I would not prefer music. Music is the joy of life, and it’s a joy that I refuse to do without.</p>

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>I love music. There’s something sublime about its ability to transport me from wherever I am, whatever I’m doing, into a different place. Every song doesn’t send me to the same place, and the same song may not send me to the same place twice, but they always send me somewhere different.</p>
<p>However, people ask me what kind of music I like<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref"><sup>11</sup></a>. My usual answer of “anything” generally isn’t well received. Nonetheless, it’s both the truest and least true statement I can make.</p>
<p>It’s the truest because there is no genre, artist, or even song that I completely refuse to see the merit of listening to. Every song has its place, and even if I don’t love every aspect of a piece, I still can recognize why its loved.</p>
<p>It’s the least true statement I can make for the same reason. There is no song that I would always want to listen to. Songs that I love in most circumstances are unbearable in others.</p>

<h1 id="disclaimer"><a href="disclaimer.html">Disclaimer</a></h1>
<p>Pre-reading note: I’m writing this post<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> as I tend to write my papers. That is, a very rough sketch, a more polished draft, and so on until I have the quality I want<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> in my writing. Since I’m not too embarrassed of my (lack of) writing ability, I thought I’d post my drafts here as well<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a>. I’ll leave the final draft on the top, with the lower drafts in order from newest to oldest underneath.</p>
<h1 id="draft-4">Draft 4</h1>
<p>Those of you following this blog closely may note that this is the eighth blog post I’ve made since starting the blog. Starting one week ago today, I began writing daily. While I don’t feel the need for a disclaimer at this exact moment<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a>, I think it wise that I craft one sooner than later</p>
<p>You may ask why I feel this need<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"><sup>5</sup></a>. To answer, I would reply that disclaimers are a good way to distance oneself from their work. I have in the past<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref"><sup>6</sup></a> expressed views and beliefs I personally don’t ascribe to because I believe that they are not being given their fair share of time. Even though playing the Devil’s Advocate hasn’t come back to haunt me yet, I know that people tend to believe what you write is what you believe<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref"><sup>7</sup></a>, so I want to lessen the probability of misunderstandings. Additionally, my views often change over time. Since I’m not sure if I’ll believe everything I write in the future, it seems smart to say that my thoughts may change now rather than later.</p>
<p>Now that I’ve explained, why I’m writing my disclaimer, I should probably write it. I could copy my disclaimer from my inspiration’s blog site: “The opinions stated herein are those of <strong>me</strong> and do not necessarily reflect those of <strong>employer</strong>, the Rebelsky family, <strong>organizations</strong>, or even most other sentient beings.”<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref"><sup>8</sup></a> However, much of that disclaimer isn’t relevant to me, and it doesn’t quite express the situation I find myself in. So, this is my version: “The views and opinions expressed on this site (and linked sites) do not necessarily reflect those of the author’s current, past, or future employers, the Rebelsky family, rebelsky.com, or even the author. Readers are advised to read at their own discretion.”</p>

<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>I’ve been writing this blog for a week now, so I feel like I should probably write a disclaimer sooner rather than later. You may ask why. To that I would reply with the following:</p>
<p>Disclaimers are a good way to distance oneself from their work. Although I work for no-one, it seems important to me that I distance myself from some of my words. Those of you who know me may know that I say things I don’t believe because I believe that they are supportable enough views that they deserve their time. Even though that hasn’t come back to bite me yet, I know that people tend to believe what you write is what you believe<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref"><sup>13</sup></a>, so I want to be aware. Additionally, my views<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref"><sup>14</sup></a> change over time. Since I’m not sure if I’ll believe everything I write in the future, it seems smart to say that my thoughts may change now rather than later.</p>
<p>Now comes the writing of the disclaimer. I could copy my disclaimer from my inspiration’s blog site: “The opinions stated herein are those of <strong>me</strong> and do not necessarily reflect those of <strong>employer</strong>, the Rebelsky family, <strong>organizations</strong>, or even most other sentient beings.”<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref"><sup>15</sup></a> However, that feels intellectually dishonest. So, with some slight revisions: “The views and opinions expressed on this site (and linked sites) do not necessarily reflect those of the Rebelsky family, the domain, rebelsky.com, or even the author. Readers are advised to read at their own discretion.”</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>I’ve been writing this blog for a week now, so I feel like a disclaimer is probably a good thing to get out of the way. I could copy from my inspiration’s blog site: “The opinions stated herein are those of <strong>me</strong> and do not necessarily reflect those of <strong>employer</strong>, the Rebelsky family, <strong>organizations</strong>, or even most other sentient beings.”<a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref"><sup>16</sup></a> However, that feels intellectually dishonest. Let’s see, I could say: “The views and opinions expressed here do not necessarily reflect those of the Rebelsky family, GitHub, rebelsky.com, most sentient beings, or even the author. Any and all offense taken is deeply regretted.” That seems pretty good.</p>
<p>Why a disclaimer though? I feel like all of the cool writers use disclaimers as a way to distance those they work for from their works. Even though I work for no one right now, I still know that people tend to believe what you write is what you believe<a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref"><sup>17</sup></a>. Since I’m not sure if I’ll believe everything I write in the future, it seems smart to get that idea out of the way quickly, as well as avoiding indemnifying my family.</p>

<h1 id="feeling-safe"><a href="feeling-safe.html">Feeling Safe</a></h1>
<p>As many of you know, I am a large white man. There are many aspects of these two identities that are incredibly beneficial. What I didn’t really realize today, though, was how important that first identity is.</p>
<p>While getting ready to leave for a theatre show that we were both seeing<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>, I mentioned that I thought I might walk there, since I had time. It was around a 2.5 mile walk<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a>, so I thought there might be an objection due to the length. However, the person I was talking to, who was also a white man, said he wouldn’t feel safe walking there alone.</p>
<p>Now, I’m not sure whether it’s that living in a census-defined “rural” area makes me unafraid and trusting of my fellow person<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a>, or whether he grew up in a far different place, which led him to his comment. Nonetheless, it struck me that maybe the most important of my three identities is, in fact, large. It goes first when I describe myself<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a>, and maybe it belongs there. Where before I thought it was just the white man portion that made me feel safe, I’m reevaluating now to believe that it’s a combination of all three characteristics that lets me feel safe in any situation I find myself in.</p>
<p>But, since the goal of my blog is to be happy and cheerful<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"><sup>5</sup></a>, I’ll mention the walk. It was a beautiful walk across and then along the River Thames. I got there at sunset, so the river looked amazing. The show was fabulous, with amazing sounds and a flawless set. The acting was of the highest caliber, as was to be expected from its cast.</p>

<h1 id="my-wonderful-brothers"><a href="my-wonderful-brothers.html">My Wonderful Brothers</a></h1>
<p>Those of you who know me likely also know my brothers<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>. This post seems like a great way to talk about how amazing they are, since I sometimes forget to do that enough.</p>
<p>My older brother is everything an older brother should be. He’s smarter, kinder, and more generous than me. He follows the rules, and is just all around the perfect older brother to have. Because of him, teachers assumed I was trustable, groups accepted me, and just generally his presence made my life better growing up.</p>
<p>Now that we’re older, he’s still amazing to have around. He’s incredibly knowledgable about a variety of topics that I’m beginning to find interesting. He, along with a mutual friend of ours<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a>, share books that we enjoy reading, as well as share interesting short writings as we find them. When I need help with Excel, or really any software that a business person is likely to use, he’s there and willing to drop most things to help.</p>
<p>But, as I mentioned above, I have two brothers. The younger is really everything I could hope for in a younger brother. He is also smarter, more musical, and far more technically adept than me. For all of the softwares that aren’t common business ones, he either already knows them, or is willing and able to quickly learn them to hold my hand as I try to learn them<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a>. He’s a brilliant musician, and I love listening to him perform<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a>. He’s much wittier than me, but also much more sly about it.</p>
<p>Just as my older brother is incredibly knowledgable about topics I know nothing about and am interested in, my little brother is too<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"><sup>5</sup></a>. He’s well versed in music theory, and helps me a lot when I need a sounding board. He also has shares my impulsiveness, but in a much more constructive way. For instance, right before I left, he decided that with the extra fabric he had<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref"><sup>6</sup></a>, he would make a shirt. He’d never made clothes before, didn’t have a pattern, and still did a passable job.</p>
<p>In the interest of full disclosure, my little<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref"><sup>7</sup></a> brother is the reason for this post. I prefer writing my documents in LaTeX <a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref"><sup>8</sup></a>, and WordPress doesn’t really support that. So, I asked him to build me a website, since we own a domain for some unknown reason. He did, and assuming that I’m able to follow the (incredibly simple) instructions he gave me, my blog will be moving to <a href="http://j.rebelsky.com">j.rebelsky.com</a>. Depending on how my ability to not break software goes, I may stop updating this site.</p>
<p>In summary, I have the best brothers anyone could ask for, and I’m grateful every day that they’re in my life.</p>

<div id="analog-vs-digital">
<h1 id="analog-vs.-digital"><a href="analog-vs-digital.html">Analog Vs. Digital</a></h1>
</div>
<p>As I mentioned <a href="how-im-keeping-track-of-my-time-abroad.html">yesterday</a>, I’m keeping a digital and analog journal of my day. This is inspired by a course I’m taking on London diaries, partially my own past experience, and partially a conversation I had with the professor of the course.</p>
<p>The course on diaries includes an interactive component. That is, in addition to reading London diaries, we will be crafting our own. Now, like many children of the 21st century, I love the idea of keeping everything journaled online. This way I can make notes on my phone as I walk, have them automatically update on my computer, where I can expand with more time. If I wake up in the middle of the night with an idea, I don’t need to wake up a roommate with a lamp. However, the course requires an analog diary, so I needs must also keep a handwritten journal.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that each journal will be totally the same. Conversely, they will not be totally different. I plan to keep both journals mostly in sync, and keep only specific things out of each. For instance, problems I might have with the professor I won’t be putting in the journal that will be graded. Conversely, experiences I don’t much care about that I write for a grade won’t be recorded digitally.</p>
<p>In speaking to the professor about the idea of digital data, the point of Beowulf was raised. However, as I think about it, I agree with the professor, for the opposite reason. My professor’s point was that the Beowulf manuscript survived because it was hand written, and if a similar digital file would exist, it needs constant maintenance to keep operable.</p>
<p>I, however, feel the opposite, at least with regards to a journal. When I write in my physical journal, there are no other copies of the information. If I don’t show it to others, no one may ever know what I’ve written. I can burn the journal and remove all traces of it. Not so with a digital record. Even if I delete this WordPress site, there are still the memories left in the minds of those who read it <a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> and potential digital caches and metadata associated with it. My “private” journal is only synced through the internet and a company or three, so there are almost certainly digital records of it. So while I agree with my professor about the permanence of digital and analog writings, I don’t quite know if I agree with the logic, especially on the level of skill and importance that my writings will <a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> lack.</p>

</div>
<p>I don’t tend to keep track of my daily movements for a variety of reasons. The biggest of these is that one day in Grinnell is rarely much different from a handful or more other days, and those that are I don’t always want to remember.</p>
<p>The second reason I don’t track myself is the time required. Writing takes time, and I’m usually doing or recovering from doing.</p>
<p>Finally, as far as I can tell, most of the time I’m the only one who really cares what zany adventures I’ve gotten up to. Obviously my professors care if I show up to class <a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>, my coaches care that I show up to practice, and my friends and family care that I show up at prearranged times. Other than that, though, I really doubt that anyone cares whether I studied for three hours in Noyce or in Bucksbaum.</p>
<p>None of these apply to my time abroad. With no frame of reference, every day in London feels very different. So far I have far more free time than I know what to do with <a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a>. Finally, I’ve had at least a few people mention that they want to know what I’m doing while abroad.</p>
<p>So, for those of you keeping track at home, that was 224 words to explain why I’m writing, but not addressing the title of how <a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a>. I’m keeping track of my life in a plethora of ways. Like in Grinnell, I send the minutiae of my life to friends via various instant messaging platforms. Unlike in Grinnell, I update different social media far more frequently, I hope not to the annoyance of my friends there. I’m writing this daily journal <a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a>. Finally, I’m maintaining a hybrid journal. That is, I’m writing a journal that is partially digital and partially analog. I’ll talk about the nitty gritty of that later, but it’s been probably the source I use most to record my days.</p>

<div id="street-music-in-london">
<h1 id="street-music-inlondon"><a href="street-music-in-london.html">Street Music in London</a></h1>
</div>
<p>As with most cities, London has its share of musicians performing on the street. Although I’ve only been here a few days and in a small portion of the city, I’ve noticed two things about the street music that I don’t like.</p>
<p>The first, and pettiest, of these is that I haven’t seen or heard any bagpipes. Maybe I’m just conditioned from growing up in Grinnell, where our local bagpipe troupe practices with some regularity, but it’s shocking to me that a small Iowa town is more bagpipe-centric than London.</p>
<p>Second, almost all of the musicians I’ve seen have been using amplifiers. It’s not that I’m an audio purist, who has a problem with the idea of amplifying music. My problem is mostly just the fact that it reduces the number of musicians who can play in an area. When musicians are playing acoustic instruments <a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>, the sound is easily overwhelmed if you’re more than a few score feet away. In places like New Orleans, there’s a different musician at almost every intersection, if not also one in the middle of the block. In London, however, the sounds are amplified, which means that the entirety of King’s Cross Station only seems to have room for one person.</p>
<p>With that said, I still love the fact that there are people who are making music near where I am. It’s great, and so far they’ve all been incredibly talented.</p>
<p>Edit 1 September: Today I saw bagpipers. It looks like there is a rotating group who stands between the underground station near Parliament and Parliament.</p>

<h1 id="first-56-hours"><a href="first-56-hours.html">First 56 Hours</a></h1>
<p>My first 56 hours of life in London have passed me by, so it felt like a good time to get some reflections out of the way. Since I’ve never lived anywhere but Grinnell, I thought I’d be a little more culture shocked than I was. To be honest, London feels a lot like Grinnell so far. Or at least, London feels a lot like Grinnell during NSO. <a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> I don’t recognize most of the people, and everyone is rushing somewhere. It might help that I’m in a part of London that’s fairly old, so the buildings aren’t towering over me.</p>
<p>Some big takeaways from my first 56 hours:<br />
1. Apparently when I don’t have a 24/7 access to Google Maps and the internet, I actually have pretty good navigation.<br />
2. It takes around 30 minutes to walk around King’s Cross Station if you find yourself in that situation.<br />
3. Apparently bagpipes aren’t all that common here. In Grinnell I’m surprised if a week goes by where I don’t hear bagpipes, but so far I’ve heard and seen none.<br />
4. London weather is much nicer than Grinnell’s.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> When I walk out in the morning it’s almost, but not quite, too cold for my shirt and slacks. By 1700 <a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a>, it’s heated up to what feels like the peak of the day, and it’s only slightly uncomfortable to powerwalk through the streets.<br />
5. It’s a lot harder to find a Catholic church in London than in America. I’ve so far seen a few Church of England churches, a Baptist church, an Ethiopian Reformed Church, and a Christian Scientist gathering place. Looking at Google Maps, however, I think I should be able to find one.<br />
6. The underground is really simple to navigate. I’m still not sure how the busses work though.</p>

Speaking of starting, I’m starting this blog for three major reasons <a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a>:<br />
1. Someone asked me if I would be sending email updates about my time abroad <br />
2. I like having a forced place to write <br />
3. As my tagline notes, my father also writes <a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a> daily essays. <br />
So, expect to see some updates about travel, my life abroad, and whatever else happens to be on my mind when I sit down to write.</p>
