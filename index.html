<p>First Published: 2018 November 22</p>
<h1 id="draft-2-22-nov">Draft 2 (22 Nov)</h1>
<p>For those of you in America, today is Thanksgiving! As my high school math teacher used to say, “Thanksgiving is the best holiday;” while I don’t agree necessarily, it is a nice sentiment. But, I learned that Thanksgiving isn’t a thing in the UK. It’s not that it doesn’t make sense, just that it hurts.</p>
<p>At around 1:30 this afternoon, I realized that, time zones included, if I were home I would have just finished the first knead of my bagels. Instead, I had just finished one class, and was preparing to attend another.</p>
<p>Of course, bagels aren’t the most common Thanksgiving tradition.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> When I mentioned last night that I make bagels for the holiday, one of my diving teammates asked, “Oh, so your family’s Jewish?” I don’t think that’s why, but it’s certainly why I have the cookbook.</p>
<p>I’m just kind of bummed. At the Thanksgiving dinner that the lovely Grinnell in London staff set up, we had turkey, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, something resembling stuffing, and cranberries. Due to a mistake, we didn’t have pumpkin pie. But, as I ate it, I just realized how little the food on Thanksgiving means to me. It’s always been more about the feeding others, at least for me, and the companionship and fellowship. The food is great and all, but I prefer the fact that I’m sharing the food with my friends and family. So, from across the pond, a happy Thanksgiving to everyone who’s celebrating.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-21-nov">Draft 1 (21 Nov)</h1>
<p>Thanksgiving is an American holiday. Or, at least, Thanksgiving being celebrated today is an American custom. Here, on the other side of the pond, nothing really seems notable about it. I’ll still have all of my classes, and none of my traditions from home.</p>
<p>Now, before I start talking specifics about the traditions, I’d like to talk a bit about my traditions in general. At some point or points in my early life,<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> I was assigned the homework of bringing a list of family traditions to school. Of course, I didn’t really think we had any.</p>
<p>As I look back, I realize we have many, and I’ll probably write about them later. But, I realized we also didn’t have as many as I’d like. We used to make pasta and bread, and don’t any more. We used to have large groups of people, and don’t anymore.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>So, as Thanksgiving approached my freshman year, I had an idea. Since people had been bugging me about making bagels,<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a> and I had a lot of friends who couldn’t make it home for Thanksgiving, I suggested to my family that we host a large party for it.</p>
<p>They agreed, and so the schedule began. I awoke at around 6am to begin the different bagel recipes.</p>
<p>We made three kinds of bagel dough: a normal bagelly dough, a Guinness dough,<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"><sup>5</sup></a> and a tequila dough.<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref"><sup>6</sup></a> Within the initial dough, we made regular, poppy seed, everything, cinnamon, and blackberry.<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Of course, when you have around 200 bagels to make and shape, it’s great to have friends come. So, my 7 or so helpers and I made the outrageous number of bagels. As the crowd arrived, the bagels were ready, so people ate them. And, as friends had to depart for whatever reasons, they were able to take the bagels with them.</p>
<p>That’s another nice tradition that I’m glad for. My bagels fed not only the Rebelsky Family Thanksgiving Extravaganza,<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref"><sup>9</sup></a> but also the Women’s Basketball House, and some others.</p>
<p>After bagels, we ate and played board games through the end of the day.</p>
<p>Last year functioned similarly, though I actually have a schedule!<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref"><sup>10</sup></a><br />
6:30 AM: Bagel Bonanza (100 cups of flour!) Begins!!!<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref"><sup>11</sup></a><br />
7:00 AM: Breakfast begins (pancakes)<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref"><sup>12</sup></a><br />
3:00 PM: Dinner!<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref"><sup>13</sup></a><br />
5:00 PM: Dessert<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref"><sup>14</sup></a><br />
6:30 PM: Games!<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>The bagels we made were: regular, cinnamon, cinnamon raisin,<a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref"><sup>16</sup></a> salt,<a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref"><sup>17</sup></a> poppy seed, everything, blueberry, blackberry, strawberry,<a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote-ref"><sup>18</sup></a> apple and cinnamon,<a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote-ref"><sup>19</sup></a> asiago,<a href="#fn20" id="fnref20" class="footnote-ref"><sup>20</sup></a> Rosemary, and Rosemary and olive oil.<a href="#fn21" id="fnref21" class="footnote-ref"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>In total, we went through more than 100 cups of flour, and more than 400 bagels. It was great! I still have no clue where they all ended up, though I know that some left with everyone I could make take some.</p>
<p>But anyways, this year that will not be happening, which is sad. Hopefully next year it will again.</p>

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>This afternoon and evening, I had the wonderful opportunity to attend a series of talks, workshops, and concerts for the “History of Keyboards” event at Queen Mary.</p>
<p>It began with a pairing of a cardiologist and pianist, who are each using the other for their research. The cardiologist is using the pianist to see if music can affect cardiac pacing. The musician is composing pieces based off of the irregular heartbeat recordings from the cardiologist.</p>
<p>Later, I got to see, hear, and play with a harpsichord, clavichord, and forte piano, as well as learn how they work. Finally, I got to see some of the cool new developments in the piano world, the coolest of which in my opinion is the <a href="http://instrumentslab.org/research/mrp.html">Magnetic Resonator Piano</a>. I also got to meet the creator,<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> of the instrument, and he seems amazing as well.</p>
<p>The Magnetic Resonator is an addition that can be placed onto an existing piano. As far as I can tell and understand, it uses electromagnets to send vibrations into the strings<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> at the frequency the string vibrates, as well as the hypothetical harmonics.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>Steven Sondheim has used much of his career to push against traditional ideas of what a musical should be. Throughout his shows, he subverts traditional musical theatre ideals such as love, marriage, and idealism. In <em>Company</em>, he not only subverts the idea of how love should be portrayed, but he also dispenses with the idea of linear plot. He does not even stop there. Sondheim and Furth’s <em>Company</em> moves even one step beyond atemporal theatre, dispensing on the idea of a moving plot almost entirely. Instead of presenting a narrative of growth and change, <em>Company</em> instead presents a narrative of reflection, with little sense of time passed between scenes. As staged by Marianne Elliott, <em>Company</em> is a show in two pieces: the recurring thread of a dreaded 35<sup>th</sup> birthday, and a series of vignettes showing Bobbie’s relationship with her married friends.</p>
<p>The birthday party is staged four times in the initial script, at the beginning and end of each act.(Sondheim &amp; Furth 3,71,75,117). Elliot chooses to add a fifth staging in the middle of the first act. Additionally, rather than staging each birthday the same way, each time we see Bobbie celebrating her birthday, the scene has changed. By staging each birthday differently, Elliot drives the idea of <em>Company</em> as a reflective, rather than actioned show. Each time Bobbie remembers the scene, she’s in a different mental state, and so remembers it differently.</p>
<p>The show opens with “(Bobbie’s) empty apartment” (3). She is holding balloons spelling the number 35 and a cake sits on the table. The other actors “enter from various parts of the stage (in the production, also from the audience) and group themselves around (her) apartment,” where they speak about the nature of gifts they have brought for the celebration, and almost all exhort her to “just take (the present) back” (4,5). From the dialogue of her friends, delivered “intoning”, it is clear from the very beginning that what we are seeing is a recollection of the birthday party, not the actual party.</p>
<p>Later in the act, we see the initial room scaled down, complete with a cupcake and small balloons. Bobbie squeezes through the doorway, as she can no longer simply walk through. As this staging is not present in the initial script, there is no dialogue here. Instead, Bobbie simply looks at the mini bottle of bourbon and, shrugging, drinks it. It’s clear that she’s meant to be more accepting of her age now than she was just a few minutes ago, when the show began. Of course, it is tempered from the fact that she’d just finished smoking marijuana with friends (36-50). Given that marijuana is known to cause hallucinations, it makes sense that the most dream-like of the birthday parties would show up while she’s “stoned” (36).</p>
<p>To close the first act, Bobbie stands outside the set, which before had only happened between scenes, or as a way for characters to break into scenes where they didn’t belong (mostly during musical interludes). This time however, Bobbie is still meant to be holding the audience’s attention, as a spotlight is left on her. In the initial script, it calls for “all the birthday guests (to look) at (Bobbie) as in Act One, Scene One” (71), while the production has a doppelganger be the object of her friends’ attention. In this way, it shows that Bobbie has finally begun to distance herself from her memories. She can now see what was, without forcing herself to define it as what is.</p>
<p>The second act begins like the first, with Bobbie entering an empty white room. Unlike the first scene, however, Bobbie is forced to deal with oversized, comically large balloons. She deflates them, and her friends come in and begin to sing about how wonderful she is. When Bobbie moves, however, her friends do not change their blocking to reflect it. By leaving the blocking as if she hadn’t moved, choreographer Liam Steel reminds the audience that Bobbie is looking back on the memories. Her friends are gesturing to the memory of her, which both she and her friends can see. However, the audience, as observers, cannot.</p>
<p>The second act progresses until, as expected, the birthday scene arises again. Interestingly, the initial script calls for Bobbie to be observing the stage “unbeknownst to us” (118) while the show has Bobbie watching from upstage, in the same undefined space that she had occupied at the end of the first act. Of course, both shows have the same intent. Bobbie is watching the stage, hoping to avoid her friends.</p>
<p>The turnaround that this scene represents is a great way to see that nothing has changed during the duration of the show. Rather than Bobbie being in the room before her friends appear, her friends are in the room waiting for her to appear. But, when she fails to enter, they leave and she enters. In such a way, we see that the scene was reversed, and we’re back to where we began.</p>
<p>But, there’s far more to this show than simply the birthday sequences. While the birthdays provide a framework and regrounding to remind the audience that the show is repeating, the vignettes are where it truly becomes obvious that we are living in a dreamscape. The show opens to a single, solitary, white room. It is ringed with neon lights, and Bobbie enters. As her friends appear, they crowd the stage.</p>
<p>But, after the party has ended, rather than simply dropping a curtain and changing the scenes, Elliott and Bunny Christie’s set draws the audience into the transition. A small hallway floats in from stage right, and Bobbi enters it, then begins to fumble with keys, giving time for the entire set to shift and another room to appear. The fact that each room and set is wholly self contained after that reinforces the idea that, since memories feel self contained, so too do the rooms. The few times that we see people occupying space outside of neon rimmed rooms is almost always during a musical interlude, which is clearly not meant to represent the remembered reality.</p>
<p>Speaking of music, rather than most musicals’ approach to music, where it appears to grow naturally from the dialogue, such as a love-lost man musing about the beauty of his love, and slowly shifting to song, the music in <em>Company</em> starts and ends abruptly.</p>
<p>The first musical break occurs in the first scene, as a mockery of the traditional musical opener (7). Rather than having some portion of the cast or a dedicated story teller open the set by explaining the show, we hear and see dialogue and blocking as if a play until everyone suddenly begins to sing that “there was something we wanted to say” (10). The next time we have a musical break happens much the same.</p>
<p>Bobbie is sitting, confused and somewhat frightened by the display her friends are presenting they spar. Suddenly, Joanne enters and begins to sing. The couples join in, as if nothing is odd, but Bobbie looks as confused as the audience feels. This seems to happen throughout the entire show, where the audience sees Bobbie realizing that the songs her friends sing are not truly a part of the memory, but have been joined because she links the ideas.</p>
<p>Throughout <em>Company</em>, the audience is slowly pushed into the idea that the show is not taking place in the present. Rather, the entire show is designed to force the audience into the realization that the show is a representation of an aging woman’s view of what she’s missed by not marrying. Rather than making it an easy ending, where she either realizes that she regrets it, or doesn’t, Sondheim, Furth, and Elliot leave the audience to question whether Bobbie will seriously begin to seek a relationship In all five of the couples we see, Bobbie sees elements she wishes to embody, but also elements she hopes to never see. In such a way, the show gives the audience a more real view of a thirty five year old’s view of the pros and cons of marriage than the typical musical theatre. She is able to understand both how she would and would not benefit from marriage.</p>

<p>Steven Sondheim has used much of his career to push against traditional ideas of what a musical should be. Throughout most all of his shows, subversive elements to the status quo of musical theatre occur. In <em>Company</em>, this takes the role of its totally non-linear story. However, not content to merely dispense with the normal idea of a linear progression through time, Sondheim and Furth take the show one level further, dispensing on the idea of a moving plot almost entirely. Instead of presenting a narrative of growth and change, <em>Company</em> instead presents a narrative of reflection, with little sense of time passed between scenes.</p>
<p>Marianne Elliott’s staging of company is a show in two pieces, a birthday support structure, with vignettes interspersed for flavor. The support structure comes from the five times we see Bobbi’s birthday, once at the beginning and end of each act and once in the middle of the first act. As a note, the initial script calls for only four birthday sequences (Sondheim &amp; Furth 3,71,75,117). However, rather than staging each birthday the same way, each time we see Bobbi celebrating her birthday, the scene has changed. In doing so, the show drives home the point that it is meant to be a travel through Bobbi’s mind, with her looking at her celebration of 35 years changing based on how she feels.</p>
<p>The show opens with “(Bobbi’s) empty apartment” (3). She is holding balloons spelling the number 35 and a cake sits on the table. The other actors “enter from various parts of the stage (in the production, also from the audience) and group themselves around (her) apartment,” where they speak about the nature of gifts they have brought for the celebration, and almost all exhort her to “just take (the present) back” (4,5). From the dialogue of her friends, delivered “intoning”, it is clear from the very beginning that what we are seeing is a recollection of the birthday party, not the actual party.</p>
<p>Later in the act, rather than oversized balloons, we see the initial room scaled down. Bobbi squeezes through the doorway, rather than being able to simply walk in. As it was not in the initial script, there is no dialogue here. Instead, Bobbi simply looks at the mini bottle of bourbon and, shrugging, drinks it. This acceptance of her situation comes right after scene four, where in the midst of smoking with her friends, her exes sing a song about how horrible she is (40-50). Given marijuana’s propensity to cause people to hallucinate, it makes sense that the least real of the memory sequences would be shown here.</p>
<p>Finally, to close the act, Bobbi stands outside the set, which before had only happened between scenes, or as a way for characters to break into scenes where they didn’t belong (mostly during musical interludes). This time however, Bobbi is still meant to be holding the audience’s attention, as a spotlight is left on her. In the initial script, it calls for “all the birthday guests (to look) at (Bobbi) as in Act One, Scene One” (71), while the production has a doppelganger be the object of her friends’ attention. In this way, it shows that Bobbi has finally begun to distance herself from her memories. She can now see what was, without forcing herself to define it as what is.</p>
<p>Of course, the second act begins and makes us forget this is the case. Bobbi enters, as she did in Act One. Unlike the first scene, however, Bobbi is forced to deal with oversized, comically large balloons. She deflates them, and her friends come in and begin to sing about how great she is. However, when she leaves the center, where they’ve been gesturing, they continue to gesture to where she was. This blocking helps to remind the audience that Bobbi is looking back on the memories. Her friends are gesturing to the memory of her, which both she and her friends can see. However, the audience, as observers, cannot.</p>
<p>As expected, the show ends how it had begun and ended up to this point, with Bobbi celebrating her birthday. Interestingly, the initial script calls for Bobbi to be observing the stage “unbeknownst to us” (118) while the show has Bobbi watching from upstage, in the same undefined space that she had occupied at the end of the first act. The turnaround is interesting, however. Rather than her being there, and her friends appearing, her friends are there without her. When she fails to enter, they leave and she enters. The mirroring of staging shows us that nothing has really changed in the show. We see that nothing has changed from beginning to end.</p>
<p>But, there’s far more to this show than simply the birthday sequences. While the birthdays provide a framework we can analyze the show through, the vignettes are where it truly becomes obvious that we are living in a dreamscape. The show opens to a single, solitary, white room. It is ringed with neon lights, and Bobbi enters. As her friends appear, they crowd the stage.</p>
<p>But, after the party has ended, rather than simply dropping a curtain and changing the scenes, Elliott and Bunny Christie’s set draws the audience in.

<p>The first musical break occurs in the first scene, as a mockery of the traditional musical opener (7). Rather than having some portion of the cast, or a dedicated story teller open the set by explaining the show, before inviting the audience in, we hear and see dialogue and blocking until suddenly everyone starts singing about the fact that “there was something we wanted to say” (10). The next time we have a musical break happens much the same.</p>
<p>Bobbi is sitting, confused and somewhat frightened by the display her friends are presenting they spar. Suddenly, Joanne enters and begins to sing. The couples join in, as if nothing is odd, but Bobbi looks as confused as the audience feels.</p>
<p>Throughout <em>Company</em>, the audience is slowly pushed into the idea that the show is not taking place in the present. Instead, the entire show is built to force the audience into the realization that the show is nothing more than a representation of an aging woman’s view of what she’s missed. Rather than making it an easy ending, Sondheim, Furth, and Elliot leave the audience to question whether Bobbi will seriously begin to seek a relationship In all five of the couples we see, Bobbi sees elements she wishes to embody, but also elements she hopes to never see. In such a way, the show gives the audience a more real view of a thirty five year old’s view of the pros and cons of marriage.</p>

<p>Steven Sondheim has used much of his career to push against traditional ideas of what a musical should be. Throughout most all of his shows, subversive elements to the status quo of musical theatre occur. In <em>Company</em>, this takes the role of its totally non-linear story. However, not content to merely dispense with the normal idea of a linear progression through time, Sondheim and Furth take the show one level further, dispensing on the idea of a moving plot almost entirely. Instead of presenting a narrative of growth and change, <em>Company</em> instead presents a narrative of reflection, with little sense of time passed between scenes.</p>
<p>Marianne Elliott’s staging of company is a show in two pieces, a birthday support structure, with vignettes interspersed for flavor. The support structure comes from the five times we see Bobbi’s birthday, once at the beginning and end of each act and once in the middle of the first act. However, rather than staging each birthday the same way, each time we see Bobbi celebrating her birthday, the scene has changed. In doing so, the audience becomes confused as to the reality of the show. Is the goal to see the five ways that Bobbi’s birthday could go, as she reflects on the future? Is it the way that she remembers it based on how she’s feeling at that exact moment? Or, is it a reflection on the slowly deteriorating mind of a woman attacked from all sides? The show doesn’t seek to answer this question.</p>
<p>As exciting as each of the birthday sequences is, the vignettes are where the life of the show comes through.</p>
<p>Ok so predraft time again so i don’t keep flow of consciousness writing</p>
<p>Company tells non linear story This is expressed through the scenes that have no relation or reference to each other, the birthday parties. So what? it’s cool idk im sure something will come when I get there Wait i need an argument. Because &quot;non linear story&quot; is sort of a given, maybe yeah company is about reflection.</p>
<p>Moving on.</p>
<p>The staging of the vignettes supports the thread of remembered experience far better than the birthday parties, though. Every part of the performance suggests this sort of memory, from the staging, to the blocking, to even the dialogue.</p>
<p>When Bobbi (restarting so it’s clean)</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-18-nov">Draft 1 18 Nov</h1>
<p>Much of what low level analyses of a show attempt to do is explain what happens in the show. At a first glance, that makes sense. When describing an event to people, we have an innate desire to make it fit a narrative story. Things begin, cause other events, and then end.</p>
<p>Of course, theatre is often seen as a way to reflect life. Unlike life, we get happy endings, which resolve the problems and assure the audience that everything will work out. Like life, however, things begin.</p>
<p>Well, that is, in most theatre. Sondheim, Furth, and Elliott’s <em>Company: A Musical Comedy</em>, on the other hand, does not attempt to convey a narrative. Instead, it presents a series of vignettes, few of which seem to occupy any chronology. In fact, many of the vignettes overlap each other, just as our own memories overlap and rewrite information. <em>Company: A Musical Comedy</em> attempts to use its plot not to advance or tell a story, but rather as a reflective view of a 35 year old woman’s tangle with her relationships.</p>
<p>The clearest way to see that the show is meant to convey a sense of recollected time, rather than transpired time, is in its use of a looped narrative. Throughout the show, we see Bobbi’s 35<sup>th</sup> birthday party a total of 5 times, despite the script only specifying 4.</p>
<p>However, rather than having the celebrations remain constant, the script calls for them to change. The show opens with “(Bobbi’s) empty apartment.” (Sondheim &amp; Furth 3) She is holding balloons spelling the number 35 and a cake sits on the table. The remainder of the ensemble “enter from various parts of the stage (in the production, also from the audience) and group themselves around (her) apartment,” where they speak about the nature of gifts they have brought for the celebration, and almost all exhort her to “just take (the present) back.” (Sondheim &amp; Furth 4,5)</p>
<p>The next time we see the birthday celebration is at the end of the first act. Bobbi stands outside the set, which before had only happened between scenes, or as a way for characters to break into scenes where they didn’t belong (mostly during musical interludes). However, this time, Bobbi is still meant to be holding the audience’s attention, as a spotlight is left on her. In the initial script, it calls for “all the birthday guests (to look) at (Bobbi) as in Act One, Scene One,” (Sondheim &amp; Furth 71) while the production has a doppleganger be the object of her friends’ attention.</p>
<p>In between these two pictures of her 35<sup>th</sup> birthday party, we are exposed to a series of vignettes. In the first, Bobbi is at the home of one of the couples. She enters by walking through a doorway into another self supported neon room. It’s clear that she’s digging through her memory for the “key” to unlock the memory from her struggles. When she opens the room, she takes her seat and the lights open on the room.</p>
<p>She chats with friends, until the musical interlude, where Joanne enters and speaks about the joys of being in a stable, committed relationship. (Sondheim &amp; Furth 26) The rest of the ensemble joins in, until the song ends. As if nothing had happened, the scene resumes.</p>
<p>The next scene simply has Bobbi chatting on the porch to a different couple. There is nothing to suggest whether this happened before or after the initial scene. This happens a few more times, and then we see the act closing party.</p>
<p>There are only two constants to the entire act. First, Bobbi always has a drink of bourbon in her hand, and second, she’s always in the same red dress. The reset of the characters go through costume changes.</p>
<p>When the second act begins, it looks a lot like the first. However, this time, Bobbi is forced to deal with oversized, comically large balloons. She pops them, and her friends come in and begin to sing about how great she is. However, when she leaves the center, where they’ve been gesturing, they continue to gesture to where she was.</p>
<p>Later in the second act, rather than oversized balloons, we see the initial room scaled down. Bobbi squeezes through the doorway, rather than being able to simply walk in.</p>
<p>The show ends as it did the second act, with Bobbi not celebrating her birthday while her friends do. This time, however, there is no other Bobbi. Instead, all of her friends are there awaiting her arrival, so as to wish her a happy birthday. As she fails to arrive, however, they grow demoralized and leave.</p>
<p>Only once she is sure that her friends have departed does she enter the room. She sees the candles her friends had left burning, and, rather than try to extinguish them with her breath, as she had each of the prior times, she uses a fire extinguisher. Of course, there is still one candle burning after this. She blows it out, and the lights fall from the stage.</p>

<p>Sondheim, Furth, and Elliott’s <em>Company: A Musical Comedy</em> attempts to use its plot not to advance or tell a story, but rather as a reflective view of a 35 year old woman’s tangle with her relationships.</p>
<p>Throughout the show, we see Bobbi’s 35<sup>th</sup> birthday party a total of (4? 5?) times. From memory, there’s the first one, the one with the friends facing the fake Bobbi, the one where the balloons are gigantic, which i think was the second act opener, the one where the entire room is tiny, and the ending one. So that would be five times. Great.</p>
<p>Throughout the show, we see Bobbi’s 35<sup>th</sup> birthday party a total of 5 times. Each of the times we see the celebrations, they have changed. The first time we see the party, Bobbi enters a white room, ringed in neon.</p>
<p>She is holding balloons spelling the number 35 and a cake sits on the table. Slowly, her friends enter. They speak about the nature of gifts they have brought for the celebration, and almost all exhort her to “just take (the present) back.” (Sondheim &amp; Furth 5)</p>
<p>The second time we see Bobbi’s celebrations is at the close of the first act. She stands outside of the self-enclosed set, clearly meant to show that she is reflecting, rather than remembering. This impression is reinforced by the view the audience is presented with. We see a second Bobbi, facing upstage so as to hide her face.</p>
<p>This Bobbi appears to be participating in the party.</p>
<p>When the second act begins, Bobbi again enters the single solitary room. This time, however, there are gigantic balloons, which she viscously deflates.</p>
<p>Later in the act, she enters the room, which has become shrunk to less than half the size. As she has in each scene, she takes a drink of bourbon. This time it is from a minibottle, which she drinks straight.</p>
<p>The show ends as it begins, with Bobbi celebrating her birthday. As with the first act’s closer, she stands in the undecorated piece of the stage, and looks at her peers. This time, however, there is no other Bobbi. Instead, all of her friends await her arrival, so as to wish her a happy birthday. As she fails to arrive, however, they grow demoralized and leave.</p>
<p>Only once she is sure that her friends have departed does she enter the room. She sees the candles her friends had left burning, and, rather than try to extinguish them with her breath, as she had each of the prior times, she uses a fire extinguisher. Of course, there is still one candle burning after this. She blows it out, and the lights fall from the stage.</p>

<p>Today’s readings are fun for me because they’re more mystical than normal. But, despite the allegories and metaphors, there are some facts we can pull out. First, eventually mankind will reach its end. Second, we don’t know when it will be. Third, the Lord will protect his people when the world does end. Fourth, the Lord will endure, as will his works.</p>
<p>Personally, I appreciate the reminder that time is limited. Regardless of when the deadline is, it still exists. And, as often happens when I realize the existence of deadlines, it makes me more aware of the people in my life. So, today is a great day to remind those you love that you do, those you trust that you have faith in them, and those you hated that you forgive them. The Year of Grace is almost over, and so we should think about where we’ve come in the past year.</p>

<p>Today’s readings tell us two important things. First, eventually mankind will reach its end. Second, we don’t know when it will be. I guess also third, the Lord will take care of us, and fourth, he’ll still be here.</p>
<p>It’s a nice reminder that, try as we may to prevent it, we can’t control the future. Every single one of us has free will, and the ability to make each day the best or worst that it could be. But, everyone else also gets to make that choice.</p>

<p>For some reason, writing that title made me think of the song by Jon Svetky, “What We Talk About When We Talk About Love”.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> But, as I wrote a post for today, I got more than 500 words in when I realized it wasn’t something I could post.</p>
<p>Most of the time, I know that I won’t be able to post a writing before I even start it. Or, in some cases, I get a paragraph or so in before I realize that it shouldn’t be published.</p>
<p>But, maybe because of discussions I’ve had with my class in the Diary course I’ve been taking, I reflected today on what we don’t write. Obviously, despite <a href="disclaimer.html">my disclaimer</a>, I’m not going to post things that I think will reflect horribly on me in my immediate future. So, I’m not going to write about how much I may hate a certain person, or how frustrated I am about a certain event that I have the wrong amount of control over, because it doesn’t help me at all to write about it.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>But, there are other things that don’t go here. As one of my classmates mentioned, we don’t mention the everyday. Of course, since I’ve been scraping the barrel sometimes to get a post, I do mention some of the everyday.</p>
<p>We don’t mention what we’re ashamed of. Obviously, this is something that is different now from the typical image of a diary. Here, I’m publishing my work with the expectation of others reading it, much like early diaries. So, I can’t put personal information that might be hurtful to someone near me, because that’s unfair to them.</p>
<p>All this is to say, I’ve realized that, much as <a href="http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~rebelsky/musings/">my inspiration</a> did in his third essay, I can’t always publish how I feel, because it may not be appropriate to the facts and realities of relationships I have. Anyways, before I start sounding maudlin,<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> I’ve realized how helpful it is for me to force myself to write something every day, and to publish it, even if I’m not ready to release it.

<p>One of the things I tend to forget is that I have somewhat of a fear of heights. More than that, I have a fear of jumping off tall heights. Maybe that isn’t a fear, the more that I think about it, and just a reasonable reaction.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, since I was never afraid of one meter, seldom of three, and not at all afraid of jumping off of five meter platforms, I decided that I would try jumping off of the 10 meter platform tonight. I got to the 7 meter, and began climbing up to the 10.</p>
<p>I didn’t realize how close to the roof I was, especially since it seemed so high before I started. Wow that was scary.</p>
<p>But, I jumped. I was in the air way too long. And then I hit the water. Next week I’ll try going in head first.</p>

<p>Tonight, I had the lovely fortune of seeing George Furth and Steven Sondheim’s <em>Company</em> performed at the Gielgud Theatre. It was a show where the main character’s sex was flipped. No longer about Bobby, this show was about Bobbi.</p>
<p>It was incredibly enjoyable. The set mostly took the form of small, modular pieces which were surrounded by neon lights. They moved back and forth and up and down stage, and in some instances even up and down vertically. The music was beautiful, as is to be expected.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the orchestra was above the actors, rather than in a pit. The actors and actresses all performed brilliantly.</p>
<p>As to the production itself, for most of the show I’m unsure how different it was from the original script. I went in mostly blind, as I do for most musicals. However, I had seen a recording of the song “Barcelona.”</p>
<p>In this version, where the main character sleeps with a man, rather than the original which had the genders switched, there were some differences in how I felt as an audience member. Despite the fact that the staging seemed almost identical, it’s interesting how different some of the lines and blocking felt when delivered from a person of the opposite sex.</p>
<p>Overall, it was very enjoyable</p>

<p>Mark 12:44-44 “ A poor widow also came and put in two small coins worth a few cents. Calling his disciples to himself, he said to them, ‘Amen, I say to you, this poor widow put in more than all the other contributors to the treasury. For they have all contributed from their surplus wealth, but she, from her poverty, has contributed all she had, her whole livelihood.’”</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today’s Gospel gives the message that I’ve always had the hardest part reconciling with the teachings we see in daily religious life. The Lord says that the widow’s gift, though small, means the most, as she has the least to give.</p>
<p>As a Catholic, I am taught that faith is a call to action. The sentiment that “faith without action is dead” is not an uncommon one. So, why is it that we see good deeds done by the faithless as anything but the miracles that they are?</p>
<p>When a faithful person performs a good deed, it shouldn’t be remarkable. They are simply doing what their soul tells them to do. When they make the choice to not do good, it takes an effort. But, someone who doesn’t believe doesn’t have that call. For those without faith, if we believe that faith is what calls you to action, there is no call to do good.</p>
<p>And yet, the faithless still do good. To me, that’s the most beautiful part of life</p>

<p>First, it was interesting that, other than Jesus, who had what I think was meant to be a California Surfer accent, all of the characters spoke with East Coast accents. Second, I didn’t realize how explicit the innuendo was in “Baptize Me.” Finally, the characters were almost over the top in how stereotypically American they sounded and acted at times.

But, since coming abroad, I haven’t made bread once. It’s a travesty, I know. To rectify this horrible occasion, on one of the worst anniversaries in British history, I made some bread.</p>
<p>Of course, I had to make adjustments to my general recipe. First, I tend to use five pounds of flour at a recipe. For a variety of reasons, I wasn’t going to do that.</p>
<p>So, I went with my normal way of making things, eyeballing. I poured in maybe too much yeast, but it’s yeast so it doesn’t matter.

<p>And, about an hour and a half into rising, I realized that I didn’t really want to wait until tomorrow to eat it, so I made it a semi-knead bread. I just kneaded it, and gave up on rising, so threw it in the oven.

<p>After cooking for around 20, it looked risen but still too pale. I set another timer for 10 minutes, and threw in more water.</p>

<p>First Published: 2018 November 4</p>
<p>Deuteronomy 6:5 “Therefore, you shall love the LORD, your God, with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength.”</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>The Gospel today spoke to me for the same reason that it speaks to many people. It’s an incredibly simple command that Jesus lays out. Instead of having hundreds and hundreds of rules and laws, there are only two.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>You are to love the Lord with all your heart, soul, and strength. And you are to love your neighbor as yourself. Wow that sounds nice and easy to understand and completely impossible to follow.</p>
<p>What does loving the Lord with all your heart, soul, and strength mean? How do we love Him?</p>
<p>And when we start asking those questions, we realize why there are so many rules and laws in both the Jewish faith,<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> and also in the Catholic faith.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> It’s the same reason that we can’t just say “I’ll write a novel,” and instead need to break it into smaller steps. People aren’t good at big picture projects. Dedicating our lives to a cause is the biggest picture any of us can do, but without frameworks to help us, we either find ourselves paralyzed with indecision,<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a> or led down dark paths, forged with the best of intentions. Of course, there is the slight chance that we do brighten the world, and make it a better place.</p>
<p>But, to steal an analogy given to me, the Church provides an interstate. It guarantees that if you don’t ever get off the interstate, you’ll go to heaven.</p>
<p>There’s nothing stopping you from driving down the country roads and side streets, and you’ll likely see more exciting vistas than if you stay on the interstate. But, you always run the risk of your car breaking down before you get to where you’re going.</p>

<p>First Published: 2018 November 3</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>People who know me might know that I’m somewhat flighty. Despite this, I really try to build my days around touchstones, or events that are required at a certain place and time. This works nicely in a majority of my life, as academics and extracurriculars provide this. Somehow, having anything to do in a day makes me keep track of the entire day so much better.</p>
<p>But, some days don’t have any events. Even Sundays, where I attend Mass, don’t feel like an event, because there are multiple options for time. These past two days in particular, I feel as though time has simply passed me by. I don’t really know where the last 48 hours went, though I know they must have gone somewhere. Such is life I suppose.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Normally I keep my days very structured. While it isn’t the structure that most people think of,<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> I have the entirety of my days flow around focal points, as a way to orient myself. So, when I have days with no imposed structure, they tend to disappear.</p>
<p>Today is a great example of this. I woke up at nearly 11 am, because I had no reason not to. Over the next hour and a half, I apparently wrote.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> After that, I think I watched a tv show until 5, when I helped people make dinner, and then did activities with friends. But, the day still feels as though it’s barely started. I don’t like this feeling.</p>

<p>Today I began mapping the keystrokes on my keyboard to Celtic knots. I’ve mapped around a quarter of the letters,<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> and have been able to begin drawing with what I’ve made. It may not have been one of my most productive four hours in terms of benefit to the world or self, but it was productive in the sense of losing myself to the project, if only for a bit.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today, I made a font!</p>
<p>Technically.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>Let me check the definition.</p>
<p>Maybe? I’m unsure what I made. I guess: I made a series of images that correspond to the letters on the computer keyboard.</p>
<p>Technically, even if I were to call it a font, I’m missing most of the characters. The characters I’ve mapped are: A,C,D,E,F,G,Q,R,T,W,X,Z,a,b,c,d,e,f,g,q,r,s,t,w,z,z, (space),1,2,3,4,!,@,#,$. What I made was a Celtic knot generation font. So, each letter had a different symbol attached to it, so that I could make the knots I’ve been drawing more easily and quickly. It was a semi-productive way to kill four hours, and I’m not quite done yet,<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> but I had a good time.</p>

<p>That’s a shame. I guess that I’m going to have to triple my daily word count, since this isn’t an excuse for me to stop posting, and I don’t want to subject others to the horror of my attempts at creative writing.</p>

<p>If I’ve learned anything these past few days, it’s that I broke a mirror a little more than seven years ago. For those of you who don’t have superstitious family, legend says that breaking a mirror causes seven years of bad luck. Now, I’m not saying this as a comment about my lack of luck these past seven years. As far as I can remember,<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> I’ve had a pretty great seven years. However, these past few days have been somehow so much better.</p>
<p>To begin: yesterday afternoon I found out that I had won the Hamilton lottery.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> Of course, this was a slightly double-edged sword,<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> because I was seeing Book of Mormon earlier in the afternoon. But, when I went to the first show, it was great. I got free gummis, and had a great view of the stage.</p>
<p>After the show, I checked my email. I found out that I had been accepted to a reception at Parliament a professor had applied for on my behalf. That’s super exciting.</p>
<p>Then I went to Hamilton. I was in the middle of the front row, and was tall enough that I could still see most of the show. At the end of the show, I got to take a photo with the conductor!</p>
<p>I love taking photos with techies, because they’re always so much nicer than actors when I ask to take photos with them. So, here’s to another seven years of apparently good luck.</p>

<p>Apparently I broke a mirror a little over seven years ago. Now, this isn’t to say that I have had poor luck before this, but these past few days I’ve felt uniquely lucky.

<p>A few days ago, I had the wonderful opportunity to see Resonet at the Brighton Early Music Festival. Now, I didn’t know it at the time, but, despite the fact that England is smaller than Iowa, it takes longer to get from point a to point b. And, I also was unaware that Brighton was on the southern edge of the country. All this is to say that what I thought would be a .5-1 hour trip ended up being an almost 5 hour round trip to get to the concert.</p>
<p>The show was medieval music, featuring Resonet together with Brighton Early Music Choir.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> The choir was nice, but not extremely notable, which is to be expected from community choir. Resonet’s director played a citola, and did so with equal parts grace and style. That is, at times he played with flourishes and showmanship, and at others, very subdued and calm. Their percussionist seemed to have the perfect backdrop for every piece, from a gong to a dulcimer. Although I was promised a hurdy gurdy that never appeared, the instrumentalist on recorder and bagpipes was stunning.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> The final instrumentalist played recorder and shawm and did so wonderfully.</p>
<p>As for the singers, the baritone had the voice made for singing love songs. The soprano was clear and pure, and the countertenor slotted perfectly between the two.</p>
<p>But, as is becoming the case more and more, much of my enjoyment of the show did not come from the scripted portions. I met a wonderful older woman<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> who I chatted with for a good half of an hour or so. The interactions I can make like that are part of why I love music and cities.</p>
<p>I also got a chance to speak with the conductor about his citola, the piper about his pipes, and the dulcimist<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a> about his dulcimer. It was all great fun, and well worth being out too late.</p>
<p>All in all, it was a great time, and I forgot how nice it is to watch live music in a small<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"><sup>5</sup></a> space.</p>

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Tonight, I had the wonderful fortune of seeing <em>The Height of the Storm</em> at Wyndham’s Theatre. It was a very confusing show, layering time, subjective and objective realities colliding within a fracturing mind. It hit me very powerfully, although I haven’t had to watch someone around me undergo it. I have felt some of the deja vu that the show plays with, especially when thinking about my grandparents.</p>
<p>The stage was interesting. When I first saw it, I felt a little nauseous, because it felt almost as if a two point perspective drawing made in three dimensions. However, as the show progressed, it began to feel more and more natural.</p>

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today’s gospel shows us that even when the world is against us, Christ is for us. Bartimeaus<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> calls to the Lord. People around him mock him, and yet he persists. But when the Lord answers him, he doesn’t ask for all his problems to be solved. Rather, he asks for divine intervention only in the part of his life which needs it, his loss of sight.</p>
<p>To me, that’s the other part of the message of today’s gospel. We are told that we can ask God for help, and that He will answer, even if those around scorn us. But, we should ask him only for what we cannot ourselves, or cannot via mortal means, accomplish.</p>

<p>Like I’ve mentioned before, I<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> compose. But, that composition is always alyrical or setting words to music. But, today on the bus I was playing with the<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> ukulele.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> Someone asked me to sing a song about them, so I tried to make one up.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, I thought it was better than those around me. A heckler told me that I needed rhymes. There I remembered I do horribly under pressure. But, as I pushed through, I remembered how to think of rhymes and rhythms in real time.</p>
<p>Then the ride ended and we got off the bus.</p>
<p>So, on the journey home, my mind was running with creative song ideas. Since pop country is the furthest acceptable genre from pure country music allowed in rural Iowa, I decided that I would write in that genre. The fact that there aren’t many genres that you can do<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a> with male voice and ukulele helped me come to that conclusion/</p>
<p>As I started writing though, I’d get stuck about one couplet<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"><sup>5</sup></a> into each set of lyrics. Every so often I’d end up with a whole verse<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref"><sup>6</sup></a> before realizing that I had nowhere to go with the lyrics.</p>
<p>Finally, I got a verse and chord progression that sounded nice and left me room to grow.<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref"><sup>7</sup></a> Now all I need is another verse, a chorus, and a second set of verses.

And, today on the bus I was playing with the ukulele.<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref"><sup>10</sup></a> Someone asked me to sing a song about them, so I tried to make one up.</p>
<p>I thought it was ok, until someone yelled that it needed to rhyme. I then learned that I can’t think of rhymes when put under pressure.<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref"><sup>11</sup></a> But, right as the ride ended, my creative flow kicked in. That meant that my head started thinking of music.</p>
<p>And, since everyone loves a good country song,<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref"><sup>12</sup></a> my mind started thinking of country music. But, I can’t write a <em>normal</em> country song. Despite living in what the Census defines as a “rural” area, I didn’t have the experiences that a country song tends to need. I didn’t have a dog that I loved and lost, or a heartbreak, or an unhealthy relationship with alcohol or a car. To rebut the comment about singing anyways, I can’t be that fake. My high school friends would find out.</p>
<p>So, about one couplet<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref"><sup>13</sup></a> into each set of lyrics, I’d get stuck. Finally, I got a whole verse out. Now I’m stuck. But, I figured out the melody,<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref"><sup>14</sup></a> which is good because I tend to forget melodies. So, I’ve got four lines, a melody, and a chord progression. If I can just get four more lines and a chorus, I’m cooking.</p>

<p>Today, I had the amazing opportunity to visit Stonehenge. It’s definitely not a monument I had ever planned on visiting, so the fact that I went to it is really cool to me. It’s certainly more impressive and large than the mental image I had before seeing it.</p>
<p>Also, I brought my ukulele with me today, and while at a pub, was told that I could play it if I wanted. While playing John Denver’s beloved <em>Take Me Home, Country Roads</em>, an elderly man at the bar joined along in singing. It was great!</p>

<p>As I’ve mentioned more than a few times, I do music. However, I doubt myself a lot when it comes to music. Part of this is that I have a bad ear, especially among my music friends.</p>
<p>Now, this isn’t a disparagement of myself in an attempt to get sympathy. Rather, it’s a prelude for what follows. As we all know, it’s horrible when you have a song stuck in your head. As I’ve learned, it’s even worse when the song is written in Irish Gaelic, and so you can’t search for the song by lyrics. But recently, I realized that the worst way to have a song stuck in your head is a melody that you haven’t heard.</p>
<p>That is, a tune started playing in my head, coming from the sounds I’ve heard and wanted to hear. But, although I believed the melody was a certain series of notes, I didn’t believe that it would be true, and so changed the notes when I transcribed it. When I eventually played it back to myself, I realized I’d written a different melody.</p>
<p>It took me just ignoring my mind, and trusting my instincts to get the melody I’d heard. And, now the tune isn’t stuck in my head anymore. Yay!</p>

<p>Consider the word diary. What does that concept encompass? Is a series of thoughts about life, such as Marcus Aurelius’ <em>Meditations</em> a diary? Or, would an autobiography be considered a diary? Through a series of dichotomies, the form of a diary is more easily shaped. While there are many paths, this tree will be explored only in the route that leads to a diary. Other limbs are pruned in the interest of time.</p>
<p>The first division in this tree is that of reality. Writing either has a goal of portraying reality, which is writing <em>realis</em>, or does not, writing <em>irrealis</em>. However, addressing reality can be a goal of a work even if it isn’t the the sole, or even primary goal. As long as a goal of the work is the representation of reality, the work falls into the realm of writing <em>realis</em>. As diaries nominally take the form of a chronicle of life, they are concerned with reality.</p>
<p>Within writing <em>realis</em>, another dichotomy can be drawn. This new dichotomy is the break between writings that are concerned about a single person, writings <em>solus</em>, and writings that are not, writings <em>multis</em>.</p>
<p>In the interest of fairness, there is a reasonable rebuttal to this dichotomy. Many works are not entirely about a single person, but contain sections that are. Should these writings, therefore, lie somewhere between a writing <em>solus</em> and writing <em>multis</em>? In this example, the key to understanding the dichotomy lies in the scope of observation. While the work at a whole would be a writing <em>multis</em>, the sections concerned with a single person are writings <em>solus</em>.</p>
<p>This idea of the classification of works changing based on the scope they are viewed through is important piece in defining a diary. Certain sections of a diary may place focus off of the author, and therefore belong as writings <em>multis</em>, but the diary as a whole has its focus on the author, and so belongs as a writing <em>solus</em>.</p>
<p>We again cleave the category of writings <em>realus solusque</em>. Writings <em>solus</em> are either presented as written by their subject, writings <em>sui</em>, or presented as written by another, writings <em>alius</em>. The important distinction to make here is the word “presented.” Although a “blurb” (short pre-informative piece explaining a person’s expert status before a presentation) may be written by its subject, it is still phrased in the third person as a literary convention. As a diary is generally seen to be a record of self, it belongs in writings <em>sui</em>. Here, we see <em>Meditations</em> fall off the branch of diary, as it is written in the second person as a form of address, rather than the first person style of <em>sui</em>.</p>
<p>All writings <em>sui</em> either attempt to convey the passage of time, as writings <em>tempus</em> do, or do not, as writings <em>atempus</em> do. Although a given entry in a diary may not convey the passage of time, and therefore be a writing <em>atempus</em>, the chronicling of dates conveys the passage of the subject’s life, making the diary a writing <em>tempus</em>.</p>
<p>The final division to define diary is that of chronology. Writings <em>tempus</em> can be written after the bulk of their narrative has occurred, in writings <em>praeter</em>, or written as the narrative progresses, writings <em>iam</em>. That is, autobiographies are written as a retrospective account of life, as if weaving the threads of an author’s life into a coherent tapestry. Diaries, as a contrast, may attempt to weave this tapestry, but as they chronicle events as they occur, the tapestry woven lacks a pattern. So here again, although each entry in a diary may be a writing <em>praeter</em>, as it presents the threads of the day after they’ve occurred, in a neatly bundled piece of time, each entry is written before the tapestry as a whole can be seen, making it writing <em>iam</em>.</p>
<p>By exploring the definition of the literary form of “diary,” the value of dichotomizing writing becomes apparent. Through finding the definition of a form through defining what it is not, it becomes easy to decide whether a work belongs in that form. That is, to see if a writing is a diary, one must simply ask whether it meets the requirements above: if the work focuses on expressing the reality (<em>realis</em>) of a contemporaneous account (<em>iam</em>) of the author’s (<em>solus suique</em>) passage through time (<em>tempus</em>), we will call it a diary. If not, we will choose another term.</p>

If the work focuses on telling a contemporaneous account of the author’s passage through time, it is a diary.</p>
<h1 id="draft-5-23-october-2018">Draft 5: 23 October 2018</h1>
<p>Consider the word diary. What does that concept encompass? Is a series of thoughts about life, like in Marcus Aurelius’ <em>Meditations</em> a diary? Or, is every autobiography a diary? Through a series of dichotomies, the form of a diary is more easily shaped. This binary-branching tree will be explored only in the route that leads to a diary. The other limbs are pruned from this discussion.</p>
<p>The first division in this tree is that of reality. Writing either has a goal of portraying reality, which is writing <em>realis</em>, or does not, writing <em>irrealis</em>. Of course, just because addressing reality is a goal of a work doesn’t mean it’s the sole, or even primary goal of the work. As long as the goal of addressing reality is a goal, it falls into the realm of writing <em>realis</em>.</p>
<p>Diaries nominally take the form of a chronicle of life, and are thus concerned with reality. Within the division of writing <em>realis</em>, another dichotomy can be drawn. This new dichotomy is the break between writings concerned about a single person, writing <em>solus</em>, and the writing that is not, writing <em>multis</em>.</p>
<p>Now, a rebuttal as to the validity of this dichotomy may be posed. Most works are not entirely about a single person, but do contain sections that are. In this example, the key to the dichotomy lies in scope. While the work at a whole is a work <em>multis</em>, the sections concerned with a single person are writing <em>solus</em>.</p>
<p>Now, this idea of works changing based on scope is an important piece in defining a diary. Although certain sections of a diary may place focus off of the author, and therefore belong as writings <em>multis</em>, the diary as a whole has its focus on the author.</p>
<p>Again we cleave this twice divided category. All writings <em>solus</em> are either presented as written by their subject, writings <em>sui</em>, or presented as written by another, writings <em>aliud</em>. The important distinction to make here is the word “presented.” Although a “blurb” (short pre-informative piece explaining a person’s expert status before the aforementioned presents) may be written by its subject, it is still phrased in the third person as a literary convention. As a diary is generally seen to be a record of self, it belongs in writings <em>sui</em> Here, we see <em>Meditations</em> fall off the branch of diary, as it is written in the second person, as a form of address.</p>
<p>All writings <em>sui</em> either attempt to convey the passage of time, as writings <em>tempus</em> do, or do not, as writings <em>atempus</em> do. Although a given entry in a diary may not convey the passage of time, and therefore be a writing <em>atempus</em>, the form as a whole conveys a passage through the life of the subject, making it a writing <em>tempus</em>.</p>
<p>The final, and most difficult to convey division is that of chronology. Writings <em>tempus</em> can be written after the bulk of their story has occurred, writings <em>praeter</em>, or written as the story takes place, writings <em>iam</em>. To explain, autobiographies are written as an account of life, trying to weave the threads that had occurred in the author’s life into a coherent tapestry. Diaries, as a contrast, attempt to weave a tapestry without a pattern, chronicling the events as they occur. Although each of the entries may be writing <em>praeter</em>, since the writing is not attempting to outline the whole of the author’s history into a coherent thread, rather simply chronicling the events as they occur, the diary as a whole remains writing <em>iam</em>.</p>
<p>By exploring the definition of the literary form of “diary,” the value of dichotomizing writing becomes apparent. Although a dreaded prospect by many, the idea that genres can be grouped into mutually exclusive categories makes defining a given work as belonging to that genre easier. So, to see if a writing is a diary, one must simply ask whether it meets the requirements above. If the work focuses on telling a contemporaneous account of the author’s passage through time, it is a diary.</p>
<h1 id="draft-4-23-october-2018">Draft 4: 23 October 2018</h1>
<p>Of all of the writing that is, was, or will be, only two kinds exist. All writing is either non-fictive (concerning itself with reality) or fictive, which does not. Now, to address the inevitable rebuttal of writing that concerns itself somewhat with reality, imagine a lamp. A lamp is either lit or not. Even though it may not burn its brightest, it still burns, and is lit, or is completely extinguished.</p>
<p>Diaries nominally take the form of a <em>curriculam vitae</em>, and are thus concerned with reality. Within the division of non-fictive writing, another dichotomy can be drawn, that which is biographical (concerned with a single person’s life), and that which is not. Again, a rebuttal as to the nature of this dichotomy may be posed. There are writings that contain a series of biographies. Each of the biographies within the whole are biographical, while the sum work is not. In such a way, a writing can be biographical or not, depending on the scope with which it is viewed.</p>
<p>Oddly, the question of scale makes the defense of a diary as biographical more tenable. Certain entries in a diary may focus on others, but the diary as a whole still focuses on the author.</p>
<p>Again we cleave this twice divided category. All biographical writings either find themselves as narrative (expressing the life through time), or not (expressing life atemporally). Many non-narrative biographies take the form of a “blurb,” or short pre-informative piece explaining a person’s expert status before the person presents. At the peak of the genre, the blurb expresses no notion of time, only of accolades. Again, although any given entry in a diary may be non-narrative, the diary as a whole conveys the life of an author through time.</p>
<p>Up to now, the divisions of writing into a tree have not followed typical genre listings. This next division, however, is a common one. Narrative biographies are either autobiographical or not. That is, narrative biographies are either written by the subject or not.</p>
<p>Here, the objection may be raised that the division between self and not should be placed above that of narrative, since blurbs are often written by their subject. However, since blurbs are written in the third person, tend to convey only publicly available knowledge, and portray the subject as a platonic ideal, good blurbs look the same, regardless of authorship.</p>
<p>Now, one of the less controversial pieces of typical diary writing is that a diary is written by a self about a self. This lends it nicely into the autobiographical category, and sets up for the final binary division of writing needed to specify the diary.</p>
<p>All autobiographies are either retrospective, concerned with chronicling the events before them, or not, and are concerned with recording the events as they happen. Here, we again confront the issue of scale. While each entry of a diary is written retrospectively, the diary as a whole is not. That is, although entries are written after the events, the aftereffects of the events recorded occurs after the entry is scribed.</p>
<p>With these divisions in mind, a a diary is a non-retrospective, autobiographical, narrative, biographical, non-fictive piece of writing. Now, the question may be raised as to the purpose of defining a diary, and what goals were meant to be achieved. As today’s political climate shows, without consistent definitions, no debate can be fruitful. In giving a specific definition for diary, a more fruitful debate as to the merits of diary as a form can be explored.</p>
<h1 id="draft-3-23-october-2018">Draft 3: 23 October 2018</h1>
<p>If we look at all writing that is, was, or will be, there are only two kinds of writing. There’s non-fictive writing, writing that concerns itself with reality, and fictive writing, which does not. As a metaphor, think of a lamp. A lamp is either lit or not. If it is slightly lit, it is still producing light.</p>
<p>Diaries nominally take the form of a <em>curriculam vitae</em>, and are thus concerned with reality. All writing concerned with reality is either biographical (concerned with a single person’s life), or not. Now, here a potential division can occur. What about, for instance, a series of biographies? To me, each of the biographies should be seen as their own work. In such a way, a writing can be biographical or not, depending on the scope with which it is viewed.</p>
<p>But, since diaries are a single person’s record of their own life,<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> it seems fair to say that diaries are still biographical. Now, all biographical writing is either narrative or not. A narrative biography is concerned with expressing a life through time.</p>
<p>Many non-narrative biographies take the form of a “blurb,” or short pre-informative piece explaining a person’s expert status before the person presents. While each entry in a diary may be non-narrative, the diary as a whole conveys information through time.</p>
<p>Now, the divisions so far have been fairly novel.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> All narrative biographical non-fictive writings are either autobiographical (focusing on the life of the author), or not. Now, some might argue that a blurb can also be autobiographical or not. However, since blurbs are written in the third person, and tend to convey only publicly available knowledge, a good “autobiographical” blurb should be indistinguishable from a good non-autobiographical blurb.</p>
<p>So, since a diary, as mentioned above, is a writing by a self about a self, it is autobiographical. Finally, all biographies are either retrospective, where the idea is to record events after they’ve happened, or not. Now, again we run into the problem of scale. While each entry of a diary is written retrospectively, the diary as a whole is not. That is, although entries are written after the events, more events take place and are recorded after the writing. In general, the diary takes place contemporaneously.</p>
<p>And so, a diary is a non-retrospective, autobiographical, narrative, biographical, non-fictive piece of writing. In the interest of length, the rest of the tree remains unfilled, though it is fillable.</p>
<h1 id="draft-2-19-october-2018">Draft 2: 19 October 2018</h1>
<p>Diaries, like many aspects of stereotypical female adolescence, are a nebulous concept.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> But, like any scientist, I hate undefined concepts.<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a> So, I’ve been thinking about what a diary really is.</p>
<p>I tried defining it a few different ways. First was through exclusion. In <em>A Brief History of Diaries,</em> <em>Meditations</em> by Marcus Aurelius is considered a diary, as is a shopkeeper’s logbook. Both of those didn’t seem to fit what I would consider a diary, but I couldn’t figure out why.</p>
<p>Then came the idea of<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"><sup>5</sup></a> splitting all types of writing into binary divisions. It took a few tries, but I think I’ve gotten something that works. Of course, writers hate dichotomies,<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref"><sup>6</sup></a> so I needed to make sure that each category was a real dichotomy.</p>
<p>If we look at all writing that is, was, or will be,<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref"><sup>7</sup></a> there are only two kinds of writing.<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref"><sup>8</sup></a> There is writing concerned with reality,<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref"><sup>9</sup></a> and writing that isn’t concerned with reality.<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref"><sup>10</sup></a> Of course, an immediate push back to this would be “what about writing that is partially concerned with reality?” That’s non-fictive. It is concerned with reality. It’s like saying “a room either has some form of lighting, or it doesn’t.” Dimmer lighting, or lighting only in one corner still satisfies.</p>
<p>Obviously,<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref"><sup>11</sup></a> diaries have a focus on reality, so they are non-fictive. Next, all non-fictive writing is either focused on a single entity, with the rest of creation<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref"><sup>12</sup></a> serving as a backdrop to it, or not doing that.</p>
<p>It may be helpful to give examples of writing in each category. In the biographical category, there are diaries and biographies. In the non-biographical category, we see things like epic poetry.<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>So if I ignore that, all writing concerned with reality is either narrative or not.</p>
<p>BREAK</p>
<p>Narrative writing is writing concerned with telling a story. Think about a typical biography. Conversely, there are non-narrative writings, such as instruction manuals.</p>
<p>Within narrative writing, there is autobiographical and not. Autobiographical writing is writing concerning the author. So, a member of an ethnic group writing an ethnography of the group, or authors writing about themselves.</p>
<p>Finally, all autobiographical writing is w</p>
<p>To me, a diary<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref"><sup>14</sup></a> is a non-retrospective, autobiographical, narrative, biographical, non-fictive piece of writing. In order, I’ll explain each of these pieces, from least to most specific.</p>

<p>First Published: 2018 October 22</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Tofay I had the wonderful opportunity to see <em>Antony and Cleopatra</em> as performed at the National Theatre. It was really well-staged and lit. The sounds were amazing, with one exception.</p>
<p>In the script, it calls for the predecessor of the oboe and bassoon to be playing, as it’s an eerie sound. Instrad, the show chose to use cello. It was certainly a different effect, and not one that I personally was a fan of. But, overall, the sounds were fantastic.</p>
<p>The show was a modern adaptation, and was skillfully executed. The stage continually amazed me, and was hard for me to even comprehend how it some of the changes might be done.</p>

<p>Isaiah 53:11 “Because of his affliction he shall see the light in fullness of days; Through his suffering, my servant shall justify many, and their guilt he shall bear.”</p>
<p>Today is the 29 Sunday of Ordinary Time in Year B.</p>
<p>Today’s first reading speaks about how someone will bear the sins and burdens for others. In doing so, he will “justify many.”</p>
<p>I don’t know why, but I really appreciate the imagery in the first reading.</p>
<h1 id="citation-styles"><a href="citations.html">Citation Styles</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2018 October 20</p>
<p>Prereading note: Draft 0 of this post is much more rambly and ranty than normal.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>A common comment about internet subculture is that it fractals infinitely. That is, within any interest group, you can always find divisions, going down as far as you’re willing. So, I feel better about complaining about this niche dispute, that of citation. There are two normal ways of citing in academic writing.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> There’s in-text, and there’s footnoting. For a variety of reasons, I find footnoting to be the objectively better form.</p>
<p>To me, the most important part of an essay is the flow of the prose. I’d much prefer to read an essay with a poorer argument, but a better cadence and rhythm.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> Footnoting encourages this flow, because shifting citations doesn’t affect the cadence of a sentence. Conversely, if an in-text citation changes position, or if the citation itself changes, the cadence of the sentence changes.</p>
<p>Second, in-text citations serve as a distraction. If you know me at all, you probably know that I’m incredibly distractible. When I see an in-text citation, I’m reminded of the fact that the argument comes from somewhere else, and feel an urge to read the initial argument. Or, at the very least, I stop reading the paper for a second, and start seeing the paper. That is, I stop seeing the symbols as a dialogue with the author, and start seeing blobs of ink on paper.</p>
<p>A third reason is completely arbitrary and subjective. In-text citations are associated with poor quality prose for me, if only because they were required in my formative years. We would be required to use all of the different kinds of citations,<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a> regardless of which would flow better.</p>
<p>Finally, footnotes allow the author to make notes that may not be useful in the argument, but could still be useful to the reader. In almost all of the semi-academic<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"><sup>5</sup></a> reading I’ve done, the footnotes contain information that was useful to me as a student, even though it didn’t have any direct relation to the core thesis. If using in-text citations, one is forced to either leave out the information, try to work it into the argument, or use footnotes and in-text citations. I have problems with each of these options.</p>
<p>The first option, excluding the information, makes the reading harder for a reader, and often contains prose that has sent me down wonderful educational explorations. The second, working it into the argument, bloats the prose and renders the initial argument harder to discern. The third option, that of mixing both styles, is just ugly to me.</p>
<p>Now, a fair complaint here is that in-text citations don’t deal with parenthetical expressions, and so focusing on that is unfair. Another complaint may be that good writing doesn’t need asides, as all relevant information should be in the text.</p>
<p>I’d dispute both of these responses. To the first, I believe that<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref"><sup>6</sup></a> an option that is more robust while not sacrificing any usability<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref"><sup>7</sup></a> is a better option. To the second, I believe that it presents a limited view of good writing. If in doing research on a topic, and finding that a certain path of inquiry may be interesting, but no longer relevant to the central argument, putting the information in a footnote can help a future scholar. I know that footnotes have also been useful to me in understanding the main text. When I was unsure about the meanings, I was able to consult footnotes to read what they meant. However, to rebut the response that the information should just go in a real parenthetical,<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref"><sup>8</sup></a> if I don’t need to read the information, then the parenthetical adds words that I have no need to read.</p>
<p>So, in conclusion, I much prefer reading my citations like this<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref"><sup>9</sup></a> than like this (Rebelsky 2018).</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>There are two normal ways of citing in academic writing.<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref"><sup>10</sup></a> There’s in-text, and there’s footnoting. For a variety of reasons, I find footnoting to be the objectively better form.</p>

<p>So yeah, footnotes are great and I hate in-text citation.</p>
<h1 id="draft-0">Draft 0</h1>
<p>One thing that I’ve begun to notice in a lot of English essays,<a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref"><sup>17</sup></a> is the tendency for the titles to be alliterative. And, that’s something that frustrates me for a few reasons. First,<a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote-ref"><sup>18</sup></a> the titles tend to be much harder to speak aloud. Second, they tend to be less descriptive. But, that’s not the point of today’s post.</p>
<p>Rather, it’s an internal complaint about my own inability to write an assigned essay. As I mentioned <a href="writers-block.html">yesterday</a>, I don’t tend to find myself unable to write anything. Rather, it tends to be the issue of writing the correct thing. And yet, with a paper that’s currently assigned, I find myself with the problem of being unable to find anything to write about.</p>
<p>I’ve tried to force myself to write anything, and it’s been some of the most strained, painful writing I’ve done in a while. There’re probably many reasons for this. I’m going to try to go through them, and see if I can’t resolve them internally. Partially it’s due to the fact that the prompt for the essay is so vague as to allow almost all writing, while specific enough to limit any of the pieces of critical analysis I would’ve enjoyed doing.<a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote-ref"><sup>19</sup></a> Partially it’s that this week’s meeting of the class felt painful to everyone involved. Partially it’s that I have so many other assignments, which are so much more fun to do. Part of it is that I’m not allowed to cite the way that I prefer,<a href="#fn20" id="fnref20" class="footnote-ref"><sup>20</sup></a> and am instead forced to use in-text citations.</p>
<p>Now, I guess an aside, I should mention why I hate in-text citations. Or, I could just write today’s post about that. Yeah that sounds better than whining. I’ll still leave this as Draft 0 in the interest of full disclosure.<a href="#fn21" id="fnref21" class="footnote-ref"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<h1 id="writers-block"><a href="writers-block.html">Writer’s Block</a></h1>
<p>First Posted: 2018 October 19</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>One of the most dreaded occurrences in a writer’s life is writer’s block. Now, I never really have that problem. I never look at a blank page thinking “I have nothing to say.” What I get instead,<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> is the idea that nothing I have to say can be expressed in less time than I want to spend expressing it.</p>
<p>That happened a few times for me today. I’m working on another paper about diaries,<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> and in theory working on a paper about theatre. My creative juices are flowing, just not how I’d like. I thought about trying to teach what I’ve learned in my Polymers class, but that seemed like the wrong idea for a Friday.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> So, I decided that I would write about writer’s block. Of course, as I did so, I realized that I could do a journalling prompt that I’d been given, and so did it. It’s in Draft 1, if you’d like to read it. I expect this will happen again.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>In what’s likely to be the first of many installments, today I couldn’t think of anything to write. Now, other days that has also been true. Somehow I persevered and found a topic to write about. Not so today.</p>
<p>Anywho, time to try out some writing prompts I’ve been given. One is to describe an old barn as if you are an old man whose recently learned that his son died in the war, but not mentioning the son, war, or death. Here we go!</p>
<p>The barn looked much like it always had, and yet somehow different. The bright red had faded over the years, into the color of dust. Strange how dust was featuring so much in his mind today.</p>
<p>The doors creaked when you opened them, as if they’d been forgotten about over the years of milling the field. Vines had started growing up the sides, unchecked by their normal pruning.</p>
<p>What used to seem as a deep, dark black roof had shifted overnight. Whether it was the dust in the air or something else, they’d faded almost instantly into a grey, almost unnoticeable color.</p>
<p>Ok wow that was a downer. But, I got almost 200 words out of that whole shebang.<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a> So yeah, if I run out of things to write about in the future, I’ll likely try creative writing prompts. Sorry in advance to future readers.</p>

<h1 id="silly-putty-and-pitch-or-what-ive-been-learning"><a href="silly-putty-and-pitch.html">Silly Putty and Pitch, or What I’ve Been Learning</a></h1>
<p>First Posted: 2018 October 18</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>So, as I’ve mentioned before, I’m taking a class on polymers. And, so far I’ve learned<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> that the most important property of a polymer is its “glass transition temperature.” That is, the temperature when it changes from being stiff to being not stiff.</p>
<p>Different polymers behave differently after the glass transition temperature. Some become rubbery. Some, the more crystalline ones, stay stiff. Some turn into a liquid.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> Some probably do something else.</p>
<p>But! Apparently that temperature is also time dependent. That’s weird to me, since melting doesn’t feel like the sort of thing that is affected by time. But, the longer that the time frame is, the more like a liquid a polymer acts, and the shorter, the more like a solid. So, for short enough time frames, things with a glass transition of very low can remain undeformed at high temperatures. Contrastingly, pitch, which my professor describes as “hard and brittle,” flows over long enough time frames.</p>
<p>So, that’s why silly putty is stretchy when you stretch it, breaky when you smash it quickly, and pancakes if you let it sit. I thought it was cool.</p>
<p>Post Script: As I reread the title, I now am thinking of a musical piece featuring silly putty. I’ll keep y’all updated on the future of that.</p>

<h1 id="sinister-diary"><a href="sinister-diary.html">Sinister Diary</a></h1>
<p>First Posted: 2018 October 17</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>Today I began another form of record keeping: a “Sinister Diary.” Now, for those of you who don’t know,<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> sinister is the nominative masculine singluar Latin word for left.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> So, what is a “left diary”? It’s just a diary that I’m writing with my left hand.</p>
<p>In my diary making class, we talked about different ways of sparking creative journal keeping. One of these is to make a diary entry with your non-dominant hand. Now, I have always wished I could write ambidextrously, so this was a good spark to me.</p>

<p>So, I think I’ll continue my sinister diary, if only to have that as a conversation starter.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today I began another form of record keeping: the “Sinister Diary.”<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref"><sup>13</sup></a> Now, for those of you who don’t know,<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref"><sup>14</sup></a> sinister is the Latin<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref"><sup>15</sup></a> word for left.<a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref"><sup>16</sup></a> So, what is a “left daily allowance”?<a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref"><sup>17</sup></a> It’s just a diary that I’m writing with my left hand.</p>

I had the brilliant idea to write all of my Latin with my left hand, so as to embed it more deeply.

This continued to the point where I began thinking in<a href="#fn27" id="fnref27" class="footnote-ref"><sup>27</sup></a> Latin. But, I did certainly enjoy it.</p>
<p>Hence, I’ll be continuing my sinister diary.</p>

<p>First Posted: 2018 October 15</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>Today, I had the incredible opportunity to see Kwame Kwei-Armah and Shaina Taub’s adaptation of <em>Twelfth Night</em> at the Young Vic Theatre. It compresses the entire show into 90 minutes, including all of the<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> musical interludes From the opening until the curtain call, I was almost overwhelmed with joy.</p>
<p>Now, onto a description of the show itself. The show opens with an old man handing out jerk chicken.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> At least I hope that was part of the show, and it wasn’t just a random stranger giving me food.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> The set is a beautiful one point perspective feeling city street. In the middle of the thrust, a van is parked. The show begins with the van slowly moving upstage while mourners come out and soulful saxophone plays. However, that is the first and last time the show is anything less than overwhelmingly energized.</p>
<p>The biggest uniting thread in the show, other than the comic ridiculousness, is the women’s chorus. After every major plot point, they come out, singing “What’s the word on the street?” before explaining what just happened, in case we had somehow missed it.</p>
<p>Then, when Malvolio sings his song about becoming Count, it felt like the quintessential musical number, but something I couldn’t name was missing. All of a sudden, he does a magic trick and has a cane in his hand, and the chorus comes out in top hats. The tap dancing interlude that follows was exactly as fun and cheesy as it<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a> sounds. That was a hallmark of the show, honestly: the cheesy, over the top fun.</p>
<p>Another musical highlight for me was the scene where Viola<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"><sup>5</sup></a> and Andrew are preparing for the fight. I had equal parts Rocky and Meatloaf coursing through my head in the song, where the cast starts air punching and jump-roping to fast paced electrical guitar and strong drums.</p>
<p>I left the show the happiest I’ve been after a theatre production in a while. And really, what more can I say? If you get a chance, I would highly recommend watching it</p>

<p>Today, I had the incredible opportunity to see Kwame Kwei-Armah and Shaina Taub’s adaptation of <em>Twelfth Night</em> at the Young Vic Theatre. It, like all good adaptations, takes the best parts of the original show and leaves out the bad. From the opening until the curtain call, I was star struck for the entire show.</p>
<p>Now, for those of you who don’t know, I sometimes just have a great time. As the diving coach <a href="diving.html">mentioned</a>, I have an expression of joy when I’m doing things I enjoy, there diving. This weekend, I had the chance to climb around Arthur’s Seat, and had a great goofy grin on. And, tonight, my cheeks were almost sore from how much I was smiling.</p>
<p>Now, onto a description of the show itself. The show opens with an old man handing out jerk chicken.<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref"><sup>6</sup></a> At least I hope that was part of the show, and it wasn’t just a random stranger giving me food.<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref"><sup>7</sup></a> The set is a beautiful one point perspective feeling city street.

It was a cheery, fun, lively show.</p>
<p>Speaking of the chorus, they were another highlight of the show. After every major plot point, a women’s chorus came out, singing “What’s the word on the street?” before explaining what just happened, in case we had missed it.</p>
<p>But, throughout the show, every actor was as over the top as they could possibly be without making it into a farce.</p>
<p>Another musical highlight for me was the scene where Viola<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref"><sup>9</sup></a> and Andrew are preparing for the fight.

<p>Wisdom 7:7b “I called upon God, and the spirit of wisdom came to me.”</p>
<p>Today is the 26 Sunday of Ordinary Time in Year B.</p>
<p>Today’s first reading tells two important things. First, if you pray to the Lord for help, he will aid you. Second, wisdom is the ultimate treasure anyone can have.</p>
<p>The second reading echoes this sentiment, calling that “For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword.”<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> To me, this is such a meaningful statement. The word of God is what caused creation to be, is what breathes life into all of creation, and is what calls us each day to follow Him more closely. I know I don’t do it enough, but I do really appreciate the time I spend listening and reading the Word.</p>

<p>First Posted: Day beginning 2018 October 13</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today, I was planning on posting about my trip to a museum. But, I’m also in Scotland.</p>
<p>Since I was in Scotland, I decided that I should try to take the opportunity ot listen to some Scottish Folk music. Last night, my friends convinced me not to go. So, tonight, I decided to go.</p>
<p>Of course, it turns out every pub operates on the “Folk Music Friday” “Standard Pop Saturday”<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> realm for music, so finding folk music was hard. I did end up being able to find a single pub with it, around a mile away.</p>
<p>By 2300<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> I was feeling tired, and so routed myself home. After a short walk, I found that the hotel I had routed myself was a different version of the hotel that I was staying at. So, I routed myself to the correct one. Then, at 2326, the unthinkable happened: my phone died. I became slightly worried.</p>
<p>But, I found out that people were very willing to respond to “hello, do you know how to get to the train station?”<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> Of course, I soon learned that there were two train stations. Thankfully, my gut did tell me the right one, so I began heading. Somehow I ended up on a gradually curving set of streets which led me in a circle.</p>
<p>Talk about disappointing. I was so excited to see familiar sites, only to realize that it was where I had just been. Eventually, I found my way to the train station, although it was much larger than I remembered. I found a hotel, which had a map and a very helpful man who was willing to draw directions to my hotel. I found a familiar site finally, and made my way home.</p>
<p>Highlights: two drunk men, who “aren’t from around here” asking everyone near me for directions to the train station. But, I did hear some music, even though it was a little disappointing. I also managed to take more than 30000 steps, which is a lot for me.<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a> Time for some sleep.</p>

<p>Today, I was on a five hour train ride. While on the ride, I was doing some homework on the iPad that Grinnell College lent me for the semester. Then, having finished the homework, I decided to play around on the iPad. I saw that the iPad came with GarageBand, so I thought I’d play with it. It was fun!</p>
<p>I forgot how much fun it can be to make musical sounds with synthesizers. Of course, it took around three hours to make a just under three minute long piece,<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> but that’s still less time than composing, recording, and then post processing.

<p>One of my biggest concerns about studying abroad was how homesick I might get.

<p>I was expecting some culture shock, which I wrote about <a href="small-changes.html">earlier</a>. But, I was also expecting to get homesick, if only because all of my friends told me I’d feel that way.</p>

<p>First Posted: 2018 October 10<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h1 id="draft-3">Draft 3</h1>
<p>As I mentioned in <a href="disclaimer.html">an earlier post</a>,<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> I plan to leave every draft of every post visible for all eternity.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> All of those drafts have come from a<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a> continuous writing,<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"><sup>5</sup></a> except in the case of the assignments I have posted, which have taken a few days.<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>But, just because I’ve published<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref"><sup>7</sup></a> a post doesn’t mean that it’s finished. I’ve left posts before I was satisfied because I was too tired to continue.<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref"><sup>8</sup></a> Since my self defined obligation is writing daily, not writing well daily, it’s fine.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, a certain part of my personality<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref"><sup>9</sup></a> demands satisfactory writing out of me. So, I may go back and update old posts. If so, I’ll make a note about the fact that I’ve edited them, and also add in the date of first publication, since that will become relevant afterwards.<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h1 id="draft-3-1">Draft 3</h1>
<p>As I mentioned in <a href="disclaimer.html">an earlier post</a>,<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref"><sup>11</sup></a> I plan to leave every draft of every one of my posts visible for all eternity.<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref"><sup>12</sup></a> All of those drafts have come from a single writing stint, except in the case of the assignments I have posted, which have taken a few days.<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>But, just because I’ve published<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref"><sup>14</sup></a> a post doesn’t mean that it’s finished. I’ve more than once left a post not because I was satisfied, but because I was too tired to continue.<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref"><sup>15</sup></a> Since my self defined obligation is writing daily, not writing well daily, it’s fine.</p>

<p>New question: what about the drafts of my written assignments that I wrote earlier than the day that they were posted? I think I’m just going to ignore that in the past, and make an effort to remember in the future. Great.</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>As I mentioned in <a href="disclaimer.html">an earlier post</a>,<a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote-ref"><sup>18</sup></a> I’m leaving each draft of my posts up for all eternity.<a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote-ref"><sup>19</sup></a> But, just because I’ve published<a href="#fn20" id="fnref20" class="footnote-ref"><sup>20</sup></a> a post doesn’t mean that it’s finished.

Advantages: looks like I’m writing even more, lets people see what polished me looks like. Disadvantages: spams other people, I’m not even sure if I want to remember. So, I think I’m not going to make notices when I revise a post, unless there’s a significant reason to. Woo<a href="#fn25" id="fnref25" class="footnote-ref"><sup>25</sup></a> good job writing by the seat of my pants<a href="#fn26" id="fnref26" class="footnote-ref"><sup>26</sup></a> take two.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As I mentioned in an earlier post,<a href="#fn27" id="fnref27" class="footnote-ref"><sup>27</sup></a> I’m leaving each draft of my posts up for all eternity.<a href="#fn28" id="fnref28" class="footnote-ref"><sup>28</sup></a> But, just because I’ve published<a href="#fn29" id="fnref29" class="footnote-ref"><sup>29</sup></a> a post doesn’t mean that it’s finished. Very often, I’ve left the post unsatisfied, but more tired than able to continue writing. So, I publish it and call it good enough.</p>
<p>But what happens when I decide to revise a post later? Should I just add another draft number to the top? Do I make a note after the draft, like “revised this date”? Ooh, does that mean I should start writing when each draft is written? I think I’m actually going to start doing that. Whoops, instead of solving an issue I just made another. Actually, this works. Now I can just add to new drafts, or even at the top of the page, updated this date. Great job writing at the speed of thought.</p>

<h1 id="growing-the-beard"><a href="growing-the-beard.html">Growing the Beard</a></h1>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>In popular media, there’s an expression:<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> “growing the beard.” It tends to mean that a show<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> has begun to become more serious as it progresses.</p>
<p>While abroad, I’ve begun growing the beard myself. Now, this isn’t to say that I’m not still the joyful, carefree child that I was before I left. I’m growing a literal beard.</p>
<p>The reasons for this are varied. First, I enjoy having a beard, since it means that shaving takes far less time.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> If I only shave my neck,<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a> I can shave and be done in less than a minute. Even when also doing my cheeks,<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"><sup>5</sup></a> it still takes less than a few minutes. When I have to shave my whole face, it takes a fair amount more time.</p>
<p>Partially, it’s that I feel a much greater need to use shaving cream when doing my whole face. My neck doesn’t need it anymore,<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref"><sup>6</sup></a> so if I only need to trim my neck, I can save all the effort there.</p>
<p>Partially, it’s that when I shave my face, I have much higher standards. With my neck and cheeks, I’m satisfied with “less hair than before, looks vaguely like I care.” But, when I’m shaving my whole face, I want it to be smooth. The last time I counted, it took,<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref"><sup>7</sup></a> 5 strokes with the grain, 5 strokes perpendicular to the grain, and 15 strokes against the grain, all on my very close cutting razor. That’s a lot of time, and it means that I inevitably cut myself at least once.</p>
<p>So, other than convenience, there’s the fact that I like the way I look with a beard. I continually get told I look far younger when clean shaven, so this way I don’t. Tying into that reason, it’s also a way of mapping my time.</p>
<p>Every one of my friends<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref"><sup>8</sup></a> has at one point or another expressed to me that my beard has an ideal length. That generally comes in the form of “your beard is the wrong length,” but. So, while in London, I’m also taking a daily photo of my beard growth to document its progress. I take a photo in a different place everyday, as a way to motivate me to remember where I am.</p>
<p>Next, and most practically, we’ve passed the summer solstice. Days are getting shorter. Nights, therefore, are getting longer. In theory it’s getting colder.<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref"><sup>9</sup></a> Having a beard means that I’ll keep warm as the days get colder.</p>
<p>So, the reasons are: convenience, appearance, documentation, and warmth. I think that’s all the reasons I’m growing it out, but I also tend to make up reasons as asked, so it’s possible that more have existed in the past, or will in the future.</p>

<h1 id="misty-review"><a href="misty.html">Misty Review</a></h1>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today, I had the immense fortune of seeing Arinzé Kene’s “Misty” at the Trafalgar Theatre. Misty<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> tells the story of a man writing a theatrical work. Throughout the process, he deals with internal doubt, lack of support from friends and family, and pressures from the theatre administration. It was an incredible experience, and not one that I can otherwise summarize.</p>
<p>The set began basically, with a cube-like shape on the stage. Where its shadow might go, the stage was roughened. Throughout, the stage and set are changed mostly through lighting.</p>
<p>The sounds of the show came both from prerecorded audio and from two live musicians. At times, it was difficult to tell what was prerecorded, and what was being done live, which was also true of the performance itself.</p>
<p>Though serious, the show was at many points incredibly funny. Though funny, many of the jokes still pointed to deeper issues.</p>
<p>Overall, it was an experience I would repeat in a heartbeat</p>

<h1 id="reflections-on-todays-gospel"><a href="reflections-on-readings-27-ordinary-b.html">Reflections on Today’s Gospel</a></h1>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>Mark 10:15 “Amen, I say to you, whoever does not accept the kingdom of God like a child will not enter it.”</p>
<p>Today is the 27 Sunday of Ordinary Time in Year B.</p>
<p>The main focus of today’s readings is marriage,<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> but the line that stuck out to me was in the optional section of the Gospel. After exhorting the Pharisees that divorce is not from God, he talks to his disciples. Jesus tells the disciples that they must have faith like a child. For most of my life, this was one of the pieces of the Gospel I had the hardest time believing. As I look back, I realize it’s mostly that I have a problem with unquestioned faith. To be more precise, I have a problem with being told not to question my faith.</p>
<p>More importantly, I remember being a child. I questioned everything. And I do mean everything. I asked the normal questions, “why is the grass green,” “why is the sky blue,” and so on. I also<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> asked slightly odder questions, including many about my faith. I don’t think that I was not a normal child in that regard. But, I did trust that whoever I was asking would know the answer, and tell me the truth.</p>
<p>That’s what having the faith of a child means to me. Children don’t blindly follow, but they do follow. They question, but they trust in answers. There’s a sense of joy that comes with every question, and a sense of peace that comes with every answer.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Mark 10:15 “Amen, I say to you, whoever does not accept the kingdom of God like a child will not enter it.”</p>
<p>Today is the 27 Sunday of Ordinary Time in Year B.</p>
<p>The main focus of today’s readings is marriage, but the line that stuck out to me was in the optional section of the Gospel. Jesus tells the disciples that they must have faith like a child. Now, this is a belief that I’ve had a lot of trouble accepting the explanations for in my life. The way I tend to hear it expressed is that we should believe unquestioningly.</p>
<p>But, I remember being a child. I questioned everything. Questions like “Why is the sky blue? Why is grass green?” and so on were a constant feature in my life. And to me, that’s what child-like faith is about. It’s not blindly following, it’s questioning everything, to really learn about it. There’s a blind trust that the person answering your questions knows the answer,<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> and that the person answering will tell the truth.<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a> And, there’s a sense of joy and wonder when we learn something new. I still remember the constant sense of excitement I used to get whenever I learned something new. So, faith like a child means questioning everything, not nothing.</p>

<h1 id="a-broken-nose"><a href="broken-nose.html">A Broken Nose</a></h1>
<p>Prereading note: There’s mentions of injury and blood, so if you don’t want to read about that, avoid today.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As some of you know, I’m somewhat<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> non-risk-averse.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> And, that often results in some fun stories.</p>
<p>My favorite stories are probably: the time I scalped myself,<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> the time I set my hair on fire,<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a> the time I bled through fiberglass,<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"><sup>5</sup></a> and the time that I found out that all of the not brown<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref"><sup>6</sup></a> in my eye can fall to the bottom if I hit my eye correctly. Today, I get to have a new one! The time I broke my nose.</p>
<p>All things considered, it’s somewhat surprising to me that I’ve never broken it before. But, I was learning new skills today, and then misinterpreted a direction. I was on my hands, trying to learn a handstand forward roll, when I heard “go into a ball”. Now, I normally just pull my legs to my chest when I’m supposed to do that, so I did.</p>
<p>As you might expect, that threw me off balance. My knee came crashing down, and I heard a crunch. There was a lot of blood coming out.</p>
<p>But, small blessings still exist. I didn’t get any other injuries. Because of how I fell, my nose didn’t get bent out of place. I was surrounded by friends who helped me mop up the blood and start recovery.</p>
<p>But, I can now report on what a broken nose feels like.<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref"><sup>7</sup></a> It felt almost entirely like an ice cream headache. My nose still hurts to touch, but that’s fine. Up at the bridge, it was really slidy, and I could move it from side to side and up and down.<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref"><sup>8</sup></a> Here’s hoping it heals well!</p>

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>The concept of a day is an interesting one. Should it be based on sunrise, sunset, midnight, noon or sleep? Until today, I was operating under the idea of midnight, since that’s what the law says. Today, since I forgot about time, I’m using the idea of sleep cycles. So, this.</p>
<h1 id="diving"><a href="diving.html">Diving!</a></h1>
<p>I dove for the first time in London today, and it was great. I forgot how much I love diving. After my second dive, the coach said “wow you look really happy up there.” Sorry this is so abrupt, but my legs hurt from pole dancing,<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> and I’m tired. Can’t wait to be diving with the team again though.</p>

<p>Today, I had the second day of my class. It went much better than the first. At one point, someone else was unsure of what functional groups was on the molecule, and I made a new friend by telling him.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> I feel much more like I belong.</p>
<p>But, the whole experience made me realize some things. For as quickly as I got over it, there was a non-zero amount of time where I seriously considered dropping the class, and finding something else to take instead. If I, a stereotypically normal STEAM<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> person, who never feels out of place in STEAM classes, or really any classes at my home school,<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> felt out of place because I didn’t know something, how much worse must it be for people who come in already feeling like they don’t belong?</p>
<p>I don’t know, and I’m pretending that my experience with this is comparable to those who are from traditionally underrepresented groups. Instead, this really showcased for me the importance of the different outreach programs that exist to encourage these groups to continue with STEAM.</p>
<p>But, before I ramble on too much, I did really enjoy this class. I’m really excited to learn about polymers, and I hope that I’ll be able to take some of the knowledge back with me.<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<h1 id="dance-nation-essay"><a href="dance-nation-essay.html">Dance Nation Essay</a></h1>
<p>Prereading Note: This is being written for a class, and began as an adaptation from <a href="dance-nation.html">this post.</a> Each draft will also end with a word count, as there is a requirement there.</p>
<h1 id="draft-6">Draft 6</h1>
<p>Love, loss, dance, and werewolves all feature prominently in Clare Barron’s <em>Dance Nation</em> at the Almeida Theatre, which follows a children’s dance squad as they prepare for national tournaments. The show places a large emphasis on the sexualization and sexuality of young women, as well as their adolescence. Recommended for ages 16 and over, the show artfully weaves the lives of adults into their childhood recollections, creating a layered effect that both alienates and invites the audience.</p>
<p>Clearly, this dichotomy of alienation and invitation was a goal of both Barron and Director Bijan Sheibani, as every aspect of the show pushes the audience into this. From the cast’s age, to Samal Blak’s set design, to Lee Curran’s lighting, the show leaves the audience in a constant state of confusion of time, space, and location.</p>
<p>The show begins with a blank set, and so the review follows. Before the show, the crowd sees a curtain lit to the nebulous phase between translucence and transparency. A mirrored wall behind can barely be made out, with lights running up the seams. As the show opens, the curtain drops, never to be seen again. Mirrors make up the entirety of the back wall, with lights strung between each. Throughout the show, these mirrors put the audience on stage, forcing them to see and therefore confront themselves in the scenes to follow.</p>
<p>These mirrored panels turn and twist about throughout the show, changing first into the black glitter of a dance backdrop. Blak is not content to merely use the panels as typical dance decoration, however, and later turns them into doors, a wolf head, a flowered field, and even a bathroom stall.</p>
<p>Blak artfully uses the panels as their own set of dichotomies: they serve as both entrances and exits, both bridging and breaking points between scenes, and as a way to both demarcate and join different sections of the stage.</p>
<p>In addition to the dichotomy of welcome and disaffection towards the audience, Blak plays with the dichotomy of set and prop. Throughout the show, actors bring in the set pieces and props, which are pushed to the side, rather than being removed from the stage. The stage begins to feel more and more cramped as the wings fill, and it’s clear that the dancers feel the same way. Dance is slowly consuming their identities, and it’s up to them to decide how to deal with it. Curran’s lighting artfully weaves into Blak’s set. Every recurring source of lighting is used at different times to conversely bring the audience in or push them away. The most striking of these recurring lights is the portrait of the moon. The moon is used to both draw the audience into the story of Irfan Shamji’s Luke, but also to push them away during the “girls”’ rebellion dance.</p>
<p>As a final note about the set, all along the walls of the stage are trophies from dancers past. Brendan Cowell’s Dance Teacher Pat chooses to use these trophies to symbolize the show’s meaning of success. Not only does Cowell point out the one year with no trophy by saying no one remembers those dancers, he then mentions the next year, where a dancer was recruited to become a professional. One of the panels turns and shows us a shrine dedicated to the dancer, another of Blak’s masterful uses of the panels. All of the dancers begin paying homage to the dancer. This is the first of many times throughout the show that the cast speak about how winning (here becoming noticed and recruited) is the only important aspect of dance.</p>
<p>To quote a common sports saying, “winning isn’t everything, it’s the only thing.” What the show quietly but insistently points out, however, is that there is a constant culling in this mindset. Despite being a championship team, no one remembers the rest of the star’s team. Slowly but surely, in memory and in action, the weak are culled. Only the strong remain.</p>
<p>In the first scene, Miranda Foster’s Vanessa gets injured and is never heard from again. Near the end of the show, another dancer makes a mistake and quits dance forever as a result. These actions, along with monologues, showcase a dangerous aspect of not only children’s athletics, but also of society. Weakness and failure are not used as opportunities for growth, but rather as signs of inherent deficiency. And, since the weak get culled, any mistake means you no longer belong. But of course, weakness is not only physical. When Shamji’s character tells us about his nostalgia for car rides home with his mother, we never again are given the chance to view him as anything but a surface for the other actors to push ideas off of.counterpoint for other characters.</p>
<p>In addition to the theme of growth, both physical and emotional, Barron adds a message about a woman’s role. As the show culminates, Karla Crome’s Amina is placed in the unenviable position of choosing between the sport she loves and the people she loves. She is vilified for making the choice that lauded and celebrated men make in other theatrical shows. Here, Barron finally outright states a woman’s role: women are expected to exist solely for the benefit of those around them. The show had alluded to this before, with mentions of the actors bonding over shared trauma, where their growth comes from helping each other.</p>
<p>However, beautiful lights and sights, touching messages, and heartfelt acting isn’t the measure of a successful show. There were countless times during the show where I felt myself forgetting that I was in a crowd, watching a group of grown adults acting as prepubescent children, and instead saw myself as a spectator at these competitions, or a person watching some children as they grow and learn. The separation from life, if only for a few moments, is truly what makes a show worth seeing. The Almeida’s staging of <em>Dance Nation</em> certainly suspended me in time.</p>

Recommended for ages 16 and over, the show artfully weaves the lives of adults into their childhood recollections, creating a layered effect that both alienates and invites the audience.</p>
<p>Clearly, this dichotomy of alienation and invitation was a goal of Director Bijan Sheibani and Set Designer Samal Blak.</p>
<p>When first allowed on stage, the crowd sees a curtain in the murky realm between translucence and transparency. A mirrored wall behind can barely be made out, with lights running up the seams. When the show opens, the curtain drops, never to be seen again. Mirrors made up the entire back wall, with lights strung between each. Throughout the show, but especially in the beginning, these mirrors put the audience on stage, forcing them to confront themselves in the scenes to follow.</p>
<p>These mirrored panels turn and twist about throughout the show, changing first into the black glitter of a dance backdrop. Blak is not content to merely use the panels as typical dance decoration, however, and later turns them into doors, a wolf head, and even a bathroom stall.</p>
<p>The use of the panels as entries and exits, to bridge and break scenes, and at the end as a way to recognize the disjointed nature of both the show and life is sublimely achieved. Each of Blak’s set choices felt masterfully laid out.</p>
<p>Lee Curran’s lighting of the show is also incredibly helpful for setting and moving the scenes along, as well as making the minimal set feel larger. When Irfan Shamji’s Luke is on the car ride home with his mother, the moon in the upper right of the stage tells us of the long day he’s had, and connects us to the other dancers, who each have their own memories of the night. As the drive continues, orange lights flow by their faces, reminding the audience of their movement. When Ria Zmitrowicz’s Zuzu has a breakdown, the lights become harsher and harsher until a realization comes through.</p>
<p>But, these few examples are not truly representative of the lighting for the show. There were countless times during the show where I felt myself forgetting that I was in a crowd, watching a group of grown adults acting as prepubescent children, and instead saw myself as a spectator at these competitions. The acting was obviously a key piece of this, but Curran’s lighting was certainly an aspect of this. The lighting during each dance montage was as if pulled directly from a dance routine. Aline David’s choreography added to this effect, as did Moritz Junge’s costuming. Marc Teitler’s sounds added to the dichotomy that Blak and Sheibani used.</p>
<p>Blak also did a wonderful job of using set as prop, and prop as set. Actors carried in the set pieces, or pieces that they worked with remained a part of the show. In the wings of the stage grew the detritus of a dance studio throughout the show, reminding the audience that dance is never far from a young dancer’s mind. As the show progresses, the stage becomes more and more cluttered, just as the depth of the characters’ experiences do.</p>
<p>A final note about the set, as means to transition into the acting, all along what is meant to be the ceiling of the room are trophies from dance competitions past. Sheibani and Brendan Cowell’s Dance Teacher Pat choose to use these trophies as a way to symbolize the show’s meaning of success.

<p>I had the opportunity to see Clare Barron’s <em>Dance Nation</em> at the Almeida Theatre, a show that follows a U13 dance squad as it prepares for national qualifying tournaments. The show places a large emphasis on the sexualization and sexuality of young women, as well as the struggles of adolescence.</p>
<p>The stage opens with mirrors facing the audience. These mirrors put the audience on stage, and force them to confront themselves in the scenes to follow.</p>
<p>When first allowed on stage, the crowd sees a curtain in the murky realm between translucence and transparency. A mirrored wall behind can barely be made out, with lights running up the seams. When the show opens, the curtain drops, never to be seen again. Mirrors made up the entire back wall, with lights strung between each.</p>
<p>Throughout the show, the once mirrored panels turn and twist about, becoming anything from doors, to black glitter decoration, to a wolf’s head, to a bathroom stall. The use of the panels as entries and exits, as a way to bridge and break scenes, and, at the end, as a way to recognize the disjointed nature of both the show and life is fantastic. Each of Samal Blak’s set choices felt masterfully laid out.</p>

As the drive continues, orange lights flow by their faces, reminding the audience of their movement. When Ria Zmitrowicz’s Zuzu has a breakdown, the lights become harsher and harsher until her realization comes through.</p>
<p>Continuing to mess with the set, the show did a wonderful job of playing with set as prop and prop as set. Actors tended to carry in the set pieces, or pieces that they worked with remained a part of the show. Always in the wings of the stage were the detritus of a dance studio, reminding that it’s never far away, especially in the minds of the dancers. As the show progresses, the stage becomes more and more cluttered, just as the depth of the characters’ experiences do.</p>
<p>A final note about the set, as means to transition into the acting, all along what is meant to be the ceiling of the room are trophies from dance competitions past. Director Bijan Sheibani and Brendan Cowell’s Dance Teacher Pat choose to use these trophies as a way to symbolize the show’s meaning of success. Not only does the Cowell point out the one year with no trophy by saying no one remembers them, he then mentions the next year, where a dancer was recruited to become a professional. One of the panels turns and shows us a shrine dedicated to the dancer. All of the dancers begin paying homage to the dancer. This is the first of many times throughout the show that the cast speak about how winning (becoming noticed and recruited) is the only important aspect of dance. To quote a common sports saying, “winning isn’t everything, it’s the only thing.” What the show quietly but insistently points out, however, is that there is a constant culling in this mindset. Despite being a championship team, no one remembers the rest of the star’s team. Slowly but surely, in memory and in action, the weak are culled. Only the strong remain.</p>
<p>In the first scene, Miranda Foster’s Amina gets injured and is never heard from again. Near the end of the show, another dancer makes a mistake and quits dance forever as a result. These actions, along with monologues, showcase a dangerous aspect of not only children’s athletics, but also of society. Weakness and failure are not used as opportunities for growth, but rather as signs of inherent deficiency. And, since the weak get culled, any mistake means you no longer belong. 686 words.</p>

<p>Mark 9:40 “For he that is not against us is for us.”</p>
<p>Today is the 26 Sunday of Ordinary Time in Year B.</p>

<p>Jesus continues this in the gospel, where the line that stuck out most to me occurs. While it paints the world in the exact same set of two groups that toxic personalities do,<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> he does so in the opposite way. Not to let this be confused for assuming that no harm will befall you, or that we should trust everyone and everything, Jesus then tells what to do with identified enemies. In short, remove them. Whether a body part or a fellow human, it’s our duty to remove them when they lead us to sin.</p>
<p>However, the point of everyone who isn’t against you being for you is certainly an important piece of the Gospel.

<h1 id="first-day-of-class"><a href="first-day-of-class.html">First Day of Class!</a></h1>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>As those of you keeping up with my life may know, today was my first day of class at the British University I’m studying<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> at this semester.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> It looks to be a really fun class! The professor seems nice and helpful,<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> the topic seems interesting,<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a> and the students seem nice.<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"><sup>5</sup></a> Unfortunately, felt a lot like I did when I would visit a class back in the days of the college search.<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>For those of you who aren’t in the college search, who finished that ordeal long ago, or who simply don’t understand what I’m talking about, a frequent part of many campus visits is a chance to watch a class take place. You get to see students interact with each other and a professor in a somewhat live environment. But, since you<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref"><sup>7</sup></a> tend to visit these classes near the end of the term, there’s a lot of context behind many statements that don’t make sense.</p>
<p>That’s more or less how I felt here. The major is apparently fully tracked here, and only about 30 members strong. So, each of them takes every class together, and takes the same class. In effect, they have more continuity and similar educations to each other over the entire year of class they’ve had than Grinnell has in its one year Organic Chemistry sequence.<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>The professor would say things like “So-and-so mentioned this last spring, so can anyone remember (related topic)?”<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref"><sup>9</sup></a> Also, I don’t really know much<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref"><sup>10</sup></a> about Material Science.<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>But, this isn’t to bemoan my fate. As I mentioned above, I’m still incredibly excited to learn about polymers! Sure I may not have the same prior experience as the other students in the class, but that’s half the fun!</p>

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Since coming to London, I’ve been trying new and exciting recipes.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> One of these, the focus of tonight’s post, is pasta in white sauce. There are a few reasons for this.</p>
<p>First, I like pasta. It’s a good comfort food and it’s hard to make badly. Second, I like milk based products. Third, I like being able to pretend I made something, more than just dumping something into a pot.</p>
<p>So, the recipe:</p>
<p>Ingredients:<br />
Pasta<br />
Butter<br />
Cheese<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a><br />
Flour<br />
Milk<br />
Salt</p>
<p>To Make Sauce:<br />
Put approximately equal portions of butter and flour in a pan over medium to low heat.<br />
Mix until it begins to brown.<br />
Add milk and cheese.<br />
Stir, adding more milk as needed.<br />
Add salt to taste.<br />
To Make Pasta:<br />
Salt water.<br />
Cook Pasta.<br />
Drain Pasta.<br />
Put Pasta in Sauce.<br />
Serve.<br />

<h1 id="the-importance-of-being-earnest-review"><a href="importance-of-being-earnest.html">The Importance of Being Earnest Review</a></h1>
<p>Prereading note: I find myself beginning to put my words to the page<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> as the time quickly approaches midnight. As a result, I apologize for any roughness in this posting.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Tonight, I had the wonderful fortune of seeing <em>The Importance of Being Earnest</em> at the Vaudeville Theatre. Overall, the show was enjoyable, though different from what I had expected.</p>
<p>What was<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> a show of subtlety and wit became, instead, a loud and forceful and exuberant farce.</p>
<p>From the beginning, I should have known it would be so, as the curtain onstage had a quote from Oscar Wilde:<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> “If one tells the truth, one is sure sooner or later, to be found out.” As the show begins, a piano and accompanying orchestra play loudly and beautifully, as the stage slowly lights, and the once opaque curtain becomes transparent. The curtain opens, and we get a chance to see Algernon playing the piano. From his first actions, it is clear that this will be a show, not of subtly implied innuendo, but rather over the top theatrics and staging.</p>
<p>The blocking was continuously adding a second thread to the show. At the beginning, when Jack and Gwendolen are flirting during the conversation, their blocking is theatrical and beautiful. In scene three, the three servants add another layer to the show, reminding us both of the existence of the stage behind us, as well as the motion of life.</p>
<p>The lighting was continuously sublime. As peaks and valleys in action happened, so too did the lights subtly do so. In the second scene, as the day progresses, the stage left light slowly rose from perspective, and the fog on the stage cleared as well. It was a beautiful way to suggest the passage of time. In the third scene, where we see the world from the other side, just a short time later, the sun is facing from stage right. The little details like that made this production eminently enjoyable</p>

<h1 id="draft-3">Draft 3</h1>
<p>In my first year of college I gained<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> the moniker of “bread guy.”<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> Now, this was not an unforeseeable outcome. I baked<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> bread almost every day, and tended to have the same problem: by the time I finish making bread,<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a> I don’t really want it anymore, since I would’ve been smelling it for the time it took to cook.<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"><sup>5</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>This problem should have an easy resolution. I would just give it to my friends!<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref"><sup>7</sup></a> Of course, sometimes my so called “friends” wouldn’t want to eat the bread I made.<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>I know, It’s ridiculous to me too. Who wouldn’t want bread?</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I would need to get rid of the bread another way. My next step would be to find the people who occupy the hard to define mental space of people you know, but have no emotions attached to.<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref"><sup>9</sup></a> Once I found them,<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref"><sup>10</sup></a> I would also offer bread. That also didn’t have a 100% success rate, which hurt less.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I would just walk around campus and hand it out<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref"><sup>11</sup></a> to whoever I saw, and sometimes I would just leave it in public spaces near people who volunteered to dispose of it for me. Nonetheless, I made a lot of bread and got known for it.</p>
<p>Now, the moniker served another purpose.<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref"><sup>12</sup></a> The CS<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref"><sup>13</sup></a> department<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref"><sup>14</sup></a> at Grinnell College<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref"><sup>15</sup></a>was<a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref"><sup>16</sup></a> growing rapidly, so there were many students who might assume I was related to a member of the department.<a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref"><sup>17</sup></a> I assumed<a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote-ref"><sup>18</sup></a> that being known as “slightly odd person who feeds us” was better than being known as “child of very odd, grumpy, and sarcastic person,” if only because I was being described as my own entity in the first.</p>
<p>But anyways, back to what’s important: bread. My recipe is adapted from <a href="https://artisanbreadinfive.com">this website’s book</a>. I tend to make the dough in a 3 gallon ice cream container from Kilwins, as my family somehow acquired many of them. It exists below.</p>
<p>Basic Bread Dough:</p>
<p>Ingredients:<br />
5 pounds flour<a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote-ref"><sup>19</sup></a><br />
8-9 cups water<a href="#fn20" id="fnref20" class="footnote-ref"><sup>20</sup></a><br />
2 heaping tablespoons yeast<a href="#fn21" id="fnref21" class="footnote-ref"><sup>21</sup></a><br />
2 lightly heaping tablespoons kosher salt<a href="#fn22" id="fnref22" class="footnote-ref"><sup>22</sup></a><br />
Note: if making a second batch, if you leave the dough that is leftover in the container, you can skip the yeast.<a href="#fn23" id="fnref23" class="footnote-ref"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>To Make Dough:<br />
Add all ingredients together.<a href="#fn24" id="fnref24" class="footnote-ref"><sup>24</sup></a><br />
Mix until it seems to be one coherent blob of dough.<a href="#fn25" id="fnref25" class="footnote-ref"><sup>25</sup></a><br />
Cover, but not airtightly, and let sit at room temperature until doubled in size.<a href="#fn26" id="fnref26" class="footnote-ref"><sup>26</sup></a><br />
Then, cover airtight<a href="#fn27" id="fnref27" class="footnote-ref"><sup>27</sup></a> for up to two weeks<a href="#fn28" id="fnref28" class="footnote-ref"><sup>28</sup></a> The longer you let it sit, the more sour it will be.<a href="#fn29" id="fnref29" class="footnote-ref"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>To Cook:<br />
Sprinkle flour on top of dough.<a href="#fn30" id="fnref30" class="footnote-ref"><sup>30</sup></a><br />
Pull out a piece of dough the volume of bread you want.<a href="#fn31" id="fnref31" class="footnote-ref"><sup>31</sup></a><br />
Generously coating with flour, gently fold it over itself until smooth everywhere except one spot.<a href="#fn32" id="fnref32" class="footnote-ref"><sup>32</sup></a><br />
After placing the bread with the spot down,<a href="#fn33" id="fnref33" class="footnote-ref"><sup>33</sup></a> quickly score the surface of the dough with a razor blade, aiming for around half an inch deep.<a href="#fn34" id="fnref34" class="footnote-ref"><sup>34</sup></a><br />
Put onto a stone in an oven preheated for around 30 minutes at 350 F<a href="#fn35" id="fnref35" class="footnote-ref"><sup>35</sup></a> with a stone and a baking tray<a href="#fn36" id="fnref36" class="footnote-ref"><sup>36</sup></a> inside, the tray beneath the stone.<br />
Pour water onto the baking tray.<a href="#fn37" id="fnref37" class="footnote-ref"><sup>37</sup></a><br />
Let cook until bottom is hollow when tapped, or properly golden brown.<a href="#fn38" id="fnref38" class="footnote-ref"><sup>38</sup></a><br />
If in doubt, a few extra minutes never hurts, and often helps.<a href="#fn39" id="fnref39" class="footnote-ref"><sup>39</sup></a><br />
Pull out and let cool.<a href="#fn40" id="fnref40" class="footnote-ref"><sup>40</sup></a><br />

<p>I know, It’s ridiculous to me too. I would need to get rid of the bread another way.

<p>So, bread. My recipe is adapted from <a href="https://artisanbreadinfive.com">this website’s book</a>. I tend to make the dough in a 3 gallon ice cream container from Kilwins, as my family somehow acquired many of them. It exists below.</p>
<p>Basic Bread Dough:</p>

Note: I guess you can add extra water whenever, I just don’t because I’m lazy.<br />
If in doubt, a few extra minutes never hurts, and often helps.<br />
Pull out and let cool.<br />

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>My freshman year of college, I was nicknamed “the bread guy,”<a href="#fn60" id="fnref60" class="footnote-ref"><sup>60</sup></a> Now, this was not an unforeseeable outcome. I baked bread almost every day, and ran into my usual problem with baking bread. By the time the bread would be finished cooking, I wouldn’t really want to eat it anymore, since I would’ve been smelling it for the time it took to cook.<a href="#fn61" id="fnref61" class="footnote-ref"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>So, I would need to get rid of it somehow. Thankfully, instead of just setting it on fire,<a href="#fn62" id="fnref62" class="footnote-ref"><sup>62</sup></a> or otherwise wasting it, I would give it to friends. Of course, sometimes my so called “friends” wouldn’t want to eat the bread I made.</p>
<p>I know! It’s ridiculous to me too. So, I would need to get rid of the bread another way. Generally this meant finding the random people you know that you wouldn’t consider friends<a href="#fn63" id="fnref63" class="footnote-ref"><sup>63</sup></a> and offering them some fresh baked bread. Sometimes, I would just walk around campus and hand it out<a href="#fn64" id="fnref64" class="footnote-ref"><sup>64</sup></a> to whoever I saw, and sometimes I would just leave it in public spaces near people who volunteered to dispose of it for me. Nonetheless, I made a lot of bread and got known for it.</p>
<p>There was a motive behind getting this nickname. I knew that, since the CS<a href="#fn65" id="fnref65" class="footnote-ref"><sup>65</sup></a> department<a href="#fn66" id="fnref66" class="footnote-ref"><sup>66</sup></a> was<a href="#fn67" id="fnref67" class="footnote-ref"><sup>67</sup></a> growing rapidly, there were many students who might assume I was related to a member of the department. And, I figured being known as “slightly odd person who feeds us edible home made food” was better than being known as “child of very odd, grumpy, and sarcastic person,” if only because I was being described as my own entity in the first.</p>
<p>So, without further ado: my basic bread recipe. It is adapted from <a href="https://artisanbreadinfive.com">this website’s book</a>. I tend to make the dough in a 3 gallon ice cream container from Kilwins, as my family somehow acquired many of them.</p>
<p>Basic Bread Dough: Ingredients:<br />
5 pounds flour<br />
8-9 cups water<br />
2 heaping tablespoons yeast<br />
2 lightly heaping tablespoons kosher salt</p>
<p>To Make Dough:<br />
Add all ingredients together.<br />
Mix until it seems to be one coherent blob of dough.<br />
Cover, but not totally, and let sit at room temperature for a time lasting between: just barely doubled<a href="#fn68" id="fnref68" class="footnote-ref"><sup>68</sup></a> or up to 2 weeks.<a href="#fn69" id="fnref69" class="footnote-ref"><sup>69</sup></a><br />
The longer you let it sit, the more sour it will be.</p>
<p>To Cook:<br />
Sprinkle flour on top of dough.<br />
Pull out a piece of dough the volume of bread you want.<br />
Generously coating with flour, gently fold it over itself until smooth everywhere except one spot.<br />
Putting that spot down,<a href="#fn70" id="fnref70" class="footnote-ref"><sup>70</sup></a> quickly score the surface of the dough with a razor blade, aiming for around half an inch deep.<br />
Put onto a stone in an oven that has been heating for around 30 minutes at 350 F<a href="#fn71" id="fnref71" class="footnote-ref"><sup>71</sup></a> with a stone inside, and a baking tray<a href="#fn72" id="fnref72" class="footnote-ref"><sup>72</sup></a> beneath it.<br />
Pour water onto the baking tray.<br />
Let cook until bottom is hollow when tapped, or properly golden brown.<a href="#fn73" id="fnref73" class="footnote-ref"><sup>73</sup></a><br />
If in doubt, a few extra minutes never hurts, and often helps.<br />
Pull out and let cool.<br />

<h1 id="toffee-recipe"><a href="toffee-recipe.html">Toffee Recipe</a></h1>
<h1 id="draft-3">Draft 3</h1>
<p>There are some recipes I make mostly as an excuse to make others. Among those is toffee. Nowadays, I mostly<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> make toffee when I’m making chocolate toffee cookies.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> This is not a recipe for the cookies,<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> but only for the toffee.</p>
<p>Now, you may notice the preface of “nowadays” for how I make toffee lately. At first, I made toffee for its own sake. The first time I made it, I made it for one of my older brother’s friends. What follows is the fruit of my painstaking<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a> trials into making toffee.</p>
<p>Ingredients:<br />
1/2 cup salted butter<br />
1/2 white granulated sugar<br />
1 dash vanilla</p>
<p>Directions:<br />
Put butter in large sauce pan (at least 6x the volume of the butter) over low heat.<br />
When butter is mostly melted, add sugar and vanilla, and mix until well incorporated.<br />
While cooking, it should expand to a much larger size. When it does so, continue stirring until it reaches hard crack,<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"><sup>5</sup></a> or, once you’ve made it a few times, until the aroma and color is correct.<br />
Pour into a well greased sheet pan<br />
Let cool until solid.<br />
Break into pieces.<br />
Serve however you intend to.</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>When I was younger, one of the first recipes I taught myself<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref"><sup>6</sup></a> was toffee. Now, this was not an unprompted decision. A friend of my brother remarked on the expense of it, and after looking at the price, I thought it unreasonable, given how simple the recipe is. And, after much experimentation with other recipes, I’ve found one that works for me. Here it is:</p>
<p>1/2 cup salted butter<br />
1/2 white granulated sugar<br />
1 dash vanilla</p>
<p>Put butter in pan over low heat.<br />
When butter is mostly melted, add sugar and vanilla.<br />
Cook, stirring occasionally until it begins to grow in size.<br />
Continue cooking until when you drop a little into a glass of room temperature water, it cools to a hard, crunchy ball,<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref"><sup>7</sup></a> then pour onto a greased sheet pan.<br />
Let cool until solid.<br />
Break into pieces.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>When I was a young lad,<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref"><sup>8</sup></a> I learned how to make toffee. Now, this was not an unprompted decision. One of my brother’s friends really liked toffee, and I learned this when I received an email from a candy company.<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref"><sup>9</sup></a> He asked me how much it would cost to purchase some, and I thought the price looked ridiculous. When I looked up the recipe, it seemed simple enough to make. And, it is!<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref"><sup>10</sup></a> So, a recipe for Toffee:</p>
<p>1/2 cup salted butter<br />
1/2 white granulated sugar<br />
1 dash vanilla</p>
<p>Put butter in pan over low heat.<br />
When butter is mostly melted, add sugar and vanilla.<br />
Cook, stirring occasionally until it begins to grow in size.<br />
Continue cooking until the correct color, then pour onto a greased sheet pan.<br />

<h1 id="making-a-mixtape"><a href="making-a-mixtape.html">Making a Mixtape</a></h1>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>I couldn’t think of anything to write today. But, I was listening to a lot of music today, so I thought I’d try to make a mixtape. The theme is inspiration, specifically academic inspiration.</p>
<p>Front Side:<br />
Anthem by Harry Chapin<br />
Anything I’m Not by Lenka<br />
Corner of the Sky from the Pippin (New Broadway Cast Recording)<br />
Country Dreams by Harry Chapin<br />
Cover of the Rolling Stone by Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show<br />
Dammit Janet by the Rocky Horror Cast<br />
Dancing Queen by ABBA<br />
Don’t Stop Believing by Journey</p>
<p>Back Side:<br />
Grey Seal by Elton John<br />
A Hard Day’s Night by the Beatles<br />
Heartbeat (It’s a Love Beat) by the DeFranco Family<br />
How Far I’ll Go from Moana<br />
It’s Still Rock And Roll To Me by Billy Joel<br />
Kelly the Boy from Killane by the High Kings<br />
Livin’ On A Prayer by Bon Jovi<br />
Long Goodbye by the Nadas<br />
Mo Ghile Mear by Celtic Thunder</p>
<p>Explanation: Like Chapin’s protagonist, who’s “looking for an anthem”, I start by searching for motivation to start a paper. But, within seconds of writing a paper, I realize that it’s hard to be “Anything I’m Not”, and I’m hoinh to procrastinate. I’ll go find my “Corner of the Sky” to hang out at until I have the motivation to work. While in the “Country(,) Dreams” of avoiding responsibility come into my head. But, if I want to make it “On the Cover of the Rolling Stone”, I’ll need to get to work, and “Dammit Janet”<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> I can’t think of anything. I just want to be “Dancing (to) Queen”, not writing this paper. But I know that if I “Don’t stop Believing” and write this paper, I might have time to go out.</p>
<p>I can’t really work “Grey Seal” in here, but it’s a good next song. As I look at the clock, unsure of whether the 6 is an AM or PM, I realize it’s been “A Hard Day’s Night”. And, as the deadline approaches, our heart may start pumping out of control. But, if we remember that “Heartbeat (It’s a Love Beat)” you can tell yourself that it’s not panic, it’s love of the topic.</p>
<p>As the paper continues, I often wonder “How Far I’ll Go” in trying to finish the paper. What’s the tenuous connection I hope the professor won’t latch on to.</p>
<p>Each paper and assignment is still somehow different from the one before. But, as Billy Joel points out, “It’s Still Rock And Roll To Me”. Every work is different, but the same in principle.</p>
<p>“Kelly the Boy from Killane” is just a bop.</p>
<p>As I’ve mentioned a lot so far, as a deadline draws near, students often feel nervous, like they’re “Living On A Prayer”. And, as we look at the work we have left in the semester, and the time left to do it, we may have to say a “Long Goodbye” to our friends until the work we all have is resolved.</p>
<p>But, we have hope that we’ll make it through. “Mo Ghile Mear” is a song of hope, so it seems fitting to end the list.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As I’ve mentioned in many other posts, I like music. So, I decided that I would make a mix tape today. Cassette tapes apparently hold 60-90 minutes of music, so that seems like a good length to shoot for. I’ll assume 30 minutes per side, since I’m feeling unambitious.</p>
<p>Next I need a theme. I think today’s theme will be inspiration. It’s the point in the semester where it seems that inspiration is needed.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> Of course, inspiration comes in a variety of places. So, I’ll start with “Anthem” by Harry Chapin.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> I’ll follow it with Lenka’s “Anything I’m Not”.<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a> <a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"><sup>5</sup></a> Next is “Corner of the Sky” from the Pippin (New Broadway Cast Recording) <a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref"><sup>6</sup></a> Following that will be “Country Dreams” by Harry Chapin.<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref"><sup>7</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref"><sup>8</sup></a> Next: “Cover of the Rolling Stone” by Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show.<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref"><sup>9</sup></a> After this: “Dammit Janet” by the Rocky Horror Cast.<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref"><sup>10</sup></a> Of course, I would be remiss if I didn’t throw some ABBA in, so next is Dancing Queen.<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref"><sup>11</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref"><sup>12</sup></a> Continuing the theme of powerpop from older generations’ childhoods, “Don’t Stop Believing” by Journey.<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Backside: “Grey Seal” by Elton John.<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref"><sup>14</sup></a> It was so tempting to put another Harry Chapin song here,<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref"><sup>15</sup></a> but instead, “A Hard Day’s Night” by the Beatles.<a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref"><sup>16</sup></a> And: “Heartbeat (It’s a Love Beat)” by the DeFranco Family.<a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref"><sup>17</sup></a> Following that, “How Far I’ll Go” from Moana.<a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote-ref"><sup>18</sup></a> Next: since I realize I’m missing Billy Joel, “It’s Still Rock And Roll To Me”.<a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote-ref"><sup>19</sup></a> “Kelly The Boy from Killane” as performed by the High Kings follows this.<a href="#fn20" id="fnref20" class="footnote-ref"><sup>20</sup></a> Returning to nostalgia I have no right to have, “Livin’ On A Prayer” by Bon Jovi.<a href="#fn21" id="fnref21" class="footnote-ref"><sup>21</sup></a> And, following that, a song by an Iowa group<sup>,</sup>footnote<span>yay!</span> “Long Goodbye” by the Nadas.<a href="#fn22" id="fnref22" class="footnote-ref"><sup>22</sup></a> Finishing off the playlist, “Mo Ghile Mear” as performed by Celtic Thunder.<a href="#fn23" id="fnref23" class="footnote-ref"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Time to give the playlist a<a href="#fn24" id="fnref24" class="footnote-ref"><sup>24</sup></a> listen, then revise/add comments. To begin: I started with Harry Chapin’s “Anthem,” because it has a strong driving beat, which helps focus, and it has lyrics that I appreciate. Also, the background instrumentation feels much sparser than most of his songs, which I appreciate.</p>
<p>Anything I’m Not follows, as it too has a strong pulse. Unlike Chapin, Lenka has<a href="#fn25" id="fnref25" class="footnote-ref"><sup>25</sup></a> a much more cheerful outlook. The song ends with an idea of escaping, and becoming free, which fits in so well with the next song.</p>
<p>Corner of the Sky is my favorite Pippin song, and one of my favorite musical theatre songs. Like many graduates of my high school, I have fond memories of watching our choir director sing this song at our senior choir concert. The song helps keep me focused when I really need to get work done.<a href="#fn26" id="fnref26" class="footnote-ref"><sup>26</sup></a> It speaks about finding where you belong, which the next Chapin song, “Country Dreams” does as well.</p>
<p>Unlike in the Pippin song, Chapin fully accepts that he’s given up on his dreams. But, he’s accepted that, and still keeps on trucking. Especially as deadlines approach, knowing that you’ve got something, even if it’s not what you want, is all you can sometimes ask for.</p>
<p>But, we still dream big, and so to do Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show’s in “Cover of the Rolling Stone”. Of course, once you’re at the top, there’s always something that can go wrong. A car could break down outside of a house, and you might need to go into a creepy house to get your way back to civilization.</p>
<p>Of course, that’s nonsense, but “Dammit Janet” from Rocky Horror Picture Show has the strong beat that we appreciated in the first songs, and speaks of Brad’s<a href="#fn27" id="fnref27" class="footnote-ref"><sup>27</sup></a> goal to achieve.</p>
<p>Next, “Dancing Queen” by ABBA starts with the line that students dream of during studies.<a href="#fn28" id="fnref28" class="footnote-ref"><sup>28</sup></a> After 20 minutes of concentration, I need something to lighten my spirits.</p>
<p>Of course, the next song, “Don’t Stop Believing” speaks to me every time I know I don’t have enough time to finish an assignment. Somehow, I’ll make it through. And there ends the front side.</p>
<p>In the time it takes me to switch our metaphorical cassette tape over,<a href="#fn29" id="fnref29" class="footnote-ref"><sup>29</sup></a> I need a quick and lively introduction. Elton John’s “Grey Seal” gives that to me. Then, since homework is still continuing, “A Hard Day’s Night” goes through my head when I’ve been inside a building working on an assignment, and am not sure which 6 the clock is pointing to.<a href="#fn30" id="fnref30" class="footnote-ref"><sup>30</sup></a> And, as the deadline approaches, our heart may start pumping out of control. But, if we remember that “Heartbeat (It’s a Love Beat)” you can tell yourself that it’s not panic, it’s love of the topic.</p>
<p>As the paper continues, I often wonder “How Far I’ll Go” in trying to finish the paper. What’s the tenuous connection I hope the professor won’t latch on to.</p>
<p>Each paper and assignment is still somehow different from the one before. But, as Billy Joel points out, “It’s Still Rock And Roll To Me”. Every work is different, but the same in principle.</p>
<p>There’s nothing special about “Kelly the Boy from Killane”, it’s just a motivational song.</p>
<p>As I’ve mentioned a lot so far, as a deadline draws near, students often feel nervous, like they’re “Living On A Prayer”. And, as we look at the work we have left in the semester, and the time left to do it, we may have to say a “Long Goodbye” to our friends until the work we all have is resolved. And, like any good playlist, it ends with hope. Specifically, hope that someone will come set us free. Here, “Mo Ghile Mear” stands in nicely.</p>

They’re an Irish Bagpiping group in the sense that they play the Irish Bagpipes,<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> not the “normal” Scottish Pipes.<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a> Uilleann Pipes are objectively better as an instrument in many regards. So, I’ve been excited to try them, but haven’t yet.</p>
<p>The first week I was here, they didn’t meet, as it was Summer vacation in London. The second was the same. Last week, I was locked out of my dorm, so needed to find a way back into it.<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"><sup>5</sup></a> And this week, some members of the group decided to do a movie night, so I attended that instead.<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref"><sup>6</sup></a> Maybe next week?</p>

<p>Prereading note: while writing a different post,<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> I ended up needing to deeply nest some statements. I realized<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> that I had spent around equal time setting up the prereading note to actually writing the post, so I decided to just turn the note into its own post. As a result, that’s Draft 0. Also, since I needed to make sure my<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> footnotes parsed, I relabeled Draft 2 as 2/3, since it’s unclear which is the correct term.<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a> Draft 4 remains as such.</p>

<p>Prereading note: this post was written as an assignment, so drafts 4-6<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> lack much of my snark and<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> will read much more like an academic essay. In the final draft, I hope to have restored some of the charm<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> that I tend to have in my writings.</p>
<h1 id="draft-7">Draft 7</h1>
<p>Diaries today are becoming more and more of a digital phenomenon. That is, people are deciding to record their thoughts on computers, rather than paper. This transition from analog to digital is not wholly uncontroversial.</p>
<p>Many people have a distrust of digital diary keeping. However, their objections almost always orient around the alleged fragility of digital diaries.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with the Internet, online storage can seem horribly fragile. Unlike a bound book, which can last indefinitely,<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a> digital diaries require constant upkeep. If written in a word processor, a blog<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"><sup>5</sup></a> post could become unreadable if the file format becomes obsolete or unused.<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref"><sup>6</sup></a> But, most blogs are, as the name suggests, hosted on the Internet.</p>
<p>A second concern is that posts on the web may be pulled down or somehow become unavailable.<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref"><sup>7</sup></a> The fact that two different agencies,<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref"><sup>8</sup></a> both make constant backups of the Internet is seen as a lackluster response.<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref"><sup>9</sup></a> And, unlike physical diaries, anyone can access any blog from anywhere and anytime, which frees the researcher from needing the funds to go to the specific library where a diary is held, or find a way to have a copy made. The copies are automatically made to every computer accessing the site.</p>
<p>Since these backups exist so widely, it is far less likely that we will undergo a similar loss to the burning of the Library of Alexandria or the burning of the linguistic library in Brazil.<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref"><sup>10</sup></a> Had the files in the library been digital, they would have been hosted in a different site from the physical artifacts, preventing that horrible loss of knowledge.</p>
<p>That tragedy calls out the most important problem with preferring physical media over digital media. Yes, you can duplicate a physical document. If you don’t care about the exactness of the replicated document,<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref"><sup>11</sup></a> it is a fairly trivial process<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref"><sup>12</sup></a> to transcribe a backup.<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref"><sup>13</sup></a> But, as the recent burning of the Brazilian library shows, even vitally important documents aren’t always backed up.<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref"><sup>14</sup></a> The Internet, however, backs up everything.</p>
<p>And to me, the heart of digital diary and the Internet is reflected by this fact: neither promises permanence, only equality. Every work hosted on Wordpress, for instance, is equally likely to be there in fifty year’s time.<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref"><sup>15</sup></a> The famous and forgotten will both exist in perpetuity. Therefore, to me, the arguments against online diaries, especially now, some 20 years after the first published arguments, are nothing except baseless fear of the future.</p>

<p>Diaries today are becoming more of a digital phenomenon. That is, more and more people decide to record their thoughts on digital displays, rather than analog records. However, this transition from analog to digital is not wholly uncontroversial.</p>
<p>Many people have a distrust of digital diary keeping. But, examination of these objections tends to show that they are rooted in either classism or appeals to tradition.

But, most blogs are, as the name suggests, hosted on the Internet.</p>
<p>A second concern is that posts on the web may be pulled down or somehow also become unavailable. The fact that the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine<a href="#fn23" id="fnref23" class="footnote-ref"><sup>23</sup></a> or Google’s own caching system both make constant backups is seen as lackluster. O’Sullivan complains that “the Wayback Machine does not have word or subject search capabilities,”<a href="#fn24" id="fnref24" class="footnote-ref"><sup>24</sup></a>, which would hold merit if not for the fact that physical diaries and libraries also lack subject search without the work of dedicated stewards..

<p>Diaries, like many written records, are becoming more and more of a digital phenomenon. That is, more and more people decide to record their thoughts on digital displays, rather than analog records. And, like the other forms becoming digital, the transition from analog to digital is not wholly uncontroversial.</p>
<p>For many reasons, people have a distrust of digital diary keeping. But, even a mild examination of most of these objections shows that they are deeply rooted in either classist thoughts or appeals to tradition. They almost always find themselves orienting around the alleged fragility of digital diaries, regardless of the factuality of these claims.<a href="#fn26" id="fnref26" class="footnote-ref"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with the Internet, online storage can seem horribly fragile. Unlike a bound book, which can last indefinitely, digital diaries require constant upkeep. If written in a word processor, for instance, a blog<a href="#fn27" id="fnref27" class="footnote-ref"><sup>27</sup></a> post could plausibly become unreadable if the file format becomes obsolete or unused. However, since nearly old computers are still functional, and old operating systems are constantly being ported to new machines, it is unlikely that we will ever have files that we truly cannot open. They may be difficult to interpret, but no more so than damaged manuscripts.</p>
<p>A second concern is that posts on the web may be pulled down or somehow also become unavailable. The obvious rebuttal to this statement, namely the Internet Archive<a href="#fn28" id="fnref28" class="footnote-ref"><sup>28</sup></a> or Google’s own caching system is seen as lackluster. O’Sullivan complains that “the Wayback Machine (the Internet Archive) does not have word or subject search capabilities.”footnote<span>Diaries, On-Line Diaries, and the Future Loss to Archives; Or, Blogs and the Blogging Bloggers who Blog Them. C. O’Sullivan p.71</span> That argument would hold merit if not for the fact that physical diaries lack search capabilities, and libraries holding them do as well. What searching methods are available come only when dedicated people add them.</p>
<p>However, the lack of searching capabilities is never seen as a flaw in traditional diaries. Unlike physical diaries, anyone can access any blog from anywhere and anytime, which frees the researcher from needing the funds to go to the specific library where a diary is held, or find a way to have a copy made. They can also search, since every modern web browser has search and find capabilities.</p>
<p>Additionally, since these files are spread over many different servers, it is far less likely that we will undergo a similar loss to the burning of the Library of Alexandria or even the very recent burning of the linguistic library in Brazil.<a href="#fn29" id="fnref29" class="footnote-ref"><sup>29</sup></a> Had the files in the library been digital, they could have been more easily duplicated, and would have been hosted in a different site from the physical artifacts, preventing that horrible loss of knowledge.</p>
<p>That tragedy leads to the third problem with preferring physical media over digital media. Yes, you can duplicate a physical document. If you don’t care about the exactness of the replicated document, it is a fairly trivial process to transcribe a backup. But, as the recent burning of the Brazilian library shows, even vitally important documents aren’t always backed up. What guarantee does a random, insignificant citizen of the world have that anything they write will ever be relevant to historians?</p>
<p>The most honest answer is that they don’t. Most likely nothing any given blogger has to say won’t be relevant. Nonetheless, the Internet protects and safeguards it. Yes, it is true that we may not have a guarantee that this generation’s Beowulf will survive if not printed. However, even many of the manuscripts from that time are still gone. The Internet makes it more likely that the unimportant words will live on.</p>

<p>Diaries, like many written records, are becoming more and more of a digital phenomenon. And, like these other records, the transition is not wholly uncontroversial. For many reasons, people have a distrust of digital diary keeping. However, these objections are almost always classist, unreasonable, or Ludditical. They almost always find themselves orienting around the alleged fragility of digital diaries, regardless of the factuality of these claims.<a href="#fn53" id="fnref53" class="footnote-ref"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with the digital world, online storage can seem horribly fragile. Unlike a bound book, which can last indefinitely,<a href="#fn54" id="fnref54" class="footnote-ref"><sup>54</sup></a> digital diaries require constant upkeep. If written in a word processor, for instance,<a href="#fn55" id="fnref55" class="footnote-ref"><sup>55</sup></a> the blog post may can hypothetically become unreadable if the file format becomes obsolete or unused. However, since every currently obsolete file storage<a href="#fn56" id="fnref56" class="footnote-ref"><sup>56</sup></a> currently has an interpreter, it is unlikely that we will ever have files that we truly cannot open.</p>
<p>A second concern is that posts on the web<a href="#fn57" id="fnref57" class="footnote-ref"><sup>57</sup></a> may be pulled down or somehow also become unavailable. The simple rebuttal of the Internet Archive<a href="#fn58" id="fnref58" class="footnote-ref"><sup>58</sup></a> or Google’s own caching system is seen as lackluster.

Regardless of the search capabilities, the files still exist. Unlike the physical diaries, we can access all of the blogs from anywhere with an internet connection, which frees the researcher from having to find the funds to go to a library where a diary comes from.</p>
<p>Additionally, since these files are spread over many different servers, it is far less likely that we will undergo a similar loss to the burning of the Library of Alexandria<a href="#fn60" id="fnref60" class="footnote-ref"><sup>60</sup></a> or even the very recent burning of the linguistic library in South America.<a href="#fn61" id="fnref61" class="footnote-ref"><sup>61</sup></a> Had the files been wholly digital, they could have been more easily duplicated, and would have been hosted in a different site from the physical artifacts.</p>

<p>That truly is the heart of the internet. It doesn’t promise permanence, it promises equality.

And that, along with the different archiving methods, brings to the next point. This is the first time in human history where we can not only see what was written, but pinpoint to the exact second when a piece is written, edited, or deleted. Diary studiers point to the spread of the clock as a phenomenon leading to the rise of the diary and see this as a good change, and yet don’t feel the same way about the rise of digital media. To me, this is, especially 15 years after the publishing of O’Sullivan’s article, nothing except baseless fear of the future.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Diaries, like many written records, are becoming more and more of a digital phenomenon. And, like these other records, the transition is not wholly uncontroversial. For many reasons, people have a distrust of digital diary keeping. However, these objections are almost always classist, unreasonable, or Ludditical. They almost always find themselves orienting around the alleged fragility of digital diaries One common complaint about digital diaries is their alleged fragility.<a href="#fn66" id="fnref66" class="footnote-ref"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with the digital world, they can seem horribly fragile. Unlike a bound book, which can last indefinitely,<a href="#fn67" id="fnref67" class="footnote-ref"><sup>67</sup></a> digital diaries require constant upkeep. If written in a word processor, for instance,<a href="#fn68" id="fnref68" class="footnote-ref"><sup>68</sup></a> the file may become unreadable if the software becomes obsolete or unused. However, almost any old file system has seen some sort of official use, and so interpreters exist. It’s unlikely that we will ever have files that we truly cannot open.</p>
<p>A second concern is that posts on the web<a href="#fn69" id="fnref69" class="footnote-ref"><sup>69</sup></a> may be pulled down or somehow also become unavailable. The simple rebuttal of the Internet Archive<a href="#fn70" id="fnref70" class="footnote-ref"><sup>70</sup></a> or Google’s own caching system is seen as lackluster. O’Sullivan complains that “the Wayback Machine does not have word or subject search capabilities.”<a href="#fn71" id="fnref71" class="footnote-ref"><sup>71</sup></a> That argument would hold merit if not for the fact that physical diaries lack search capabilities, and libraries holding them do as well. Regardless of the search capabilities, the files still exist. It is far less likely that we will undergo a similar loss to the burning of the Library of Alexandria<a href="#fn72" id="fnref72" class="footnote-ref"><sup>72</sup></a> or even the very recent burning of the linguistic library in South America.<a href="#fn73" id="fnref73" class="footnote-ref"><sup>73</sup></a> Had the files been wholly digital, they could have been more easily duplicated, and would have been likely hosted in a different site from the physical artifacts.</p>
<p>That leads to the third problem with physical over digital media. Yes, you can duplicate a physical document. But, as the recent burning of the library shows, even drastically important documents aren’t always backed up. What guarantee does a random, insignificant citizen of the world have that anything they write will ever be relevant to historians? Even if it isn’t, the internet protects and safeguards it. Yes, we may not have as good of a guarantee of this generation’s Beowulf surviving on parchment. But, we have a much higher chance that the random thoughts of a random individual will be as accessible to future generations as that epic.</p>
<p>That truly is the heart of the internet. It doesn’t promise permanence, it promises equality. Every work hosted on wordpress is just as likely to be there in fifty year’s time.<a href="#fn74" id="fnref74" class="footnote-ref"><sup>74</sup></a> And that, along with the different archiving methods, brings to the next point. This is the first time in human history where we can not only see what was written, but pinpoint to the exact second when a piece is written, edited, or deleted. We no longer can question which draft of a manuscript is older.</p>

<h1 id="othello-review"><a href="othello.html">Othello Review</a></h1>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Tonight I had the pleasure of watching Othello at the Globe Theatre. In a wonderful turn of events, I was a groundling.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> I was right next to the stage, and even leaning on it for the piece of the play after intermission.</p>
<p>Sadly, the set and lighting didn’t blow me away. The lights were fixed and immobile, and the set more or less was as well. What I can comment on, however, was the music.</p>
<p>The show began with natural trumpets,<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> which was nice. Come the scene where Cassio becomes drunk, they are replaced with valved trumpets. Before the first intermission, they bring out the cornetti,</p>
<p>In the second act, the cornetti play lamentations as the piece falls to its tragic fate. The ending dance, however, returns with the beautiful jazz trumpeting. Other instruments included a lute during the drunk scene, played masterfully by Iago, drums and other percussion played by instrumentalists, and whistles.</p>
<p>Finally, as is requested by Shakespeare, there is singing. The drunken songs sounded drunk and merry. The whole cast song at the end was sung brilliantly.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> But, the song that struck me hardest was Desdemona and Emilia’s duet of the Willow Tree. They flowed between two part harmony and unisons flawlessly and beautifully. I stood entranced for the first<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a> time in the show. Nothing existed for me except the two flowing voices and the story they told.</p>
<p>And truly, that’s all that I can ask of a show. There was a moment where time stood still, and I found myself drawn, not into the story or characters, but simply into a place where I feel what the characters feel. Even in professional theatre, those moments can be hard to come by, but the cast brought me nearly to that point time and time again, and to the point in the soulful duet. But, as all good things do,<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"><sup>5</sup></a> it too came to an end.</p>

Jesus doesn’t reproach Peter in soft words, or calmly. In fact, he doesn’t even do it kindly. In no uncertain words, he tells Peter that he is sinning.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, 6 days later, he takes Peter to the mountain where he meets with Elijah and Moses.<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref"><sup>6</sup></a> Even though the Gospels don’t mention it, clearly Jesus forgave Peter for his actions, and Peter tried to accept this change.</p>

<p>Peter, the man who<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref"><sup>15</sup></a> loved and trusted so much so that he entrusted the Church to him, is called Satan. This is truly the best example of Jesus saying that we are to love the sinner, even if we abhor the sin. Moreso, it points out to me that we have the responsibility to help those around us who make mistakes. 6 days later, he takes Peter to the mountain where he meets with Elijah and Moses.<a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref"><sup>16</sup></a> Even though the Gospels don’t mention it, clearly there was some conversation during those 6 days where the misunderstanding was resolved.</p>

<p>Some days you go to sleep, anxiously awaiting the coming morning and day. Other days you wake up, counting down the moments until you can go back to sleep.</p>
<p>There are many factors that can influence both of those, from what’s happening in your life at a macro scale,<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> at a micro scale,<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a>, and how much sleep you’ve gotten the night<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> before.</p>
<p>Today I remembered that sleep you miss is at least as important as the other two. I didn’t sleep enough, and so today wasn’t as fully experienced as it could be. I’m hoping tomorrow will be better.</p>

<h1 id="playing-the-ukulele"><a href="playing-the-ukulele.html">Playing the Ukulele</a></h1>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As you many have gathered from my <a href="http://j.rebelsky.com/pierogi-recipe.html">prior post</a>, I play the ukulele.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> There are two reasons I thought it important to bring with me on my trip to London. First, it’s the smallest instrument I know<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> that can play chords and harmony, which is nice when I want to sing along with a backing.</p>
<p>The other reason is that I have minimal difficulty playing melodies on it. Whether I’m plucking out an old familiar melody to decide how to accompany it, playing along to my singing new melodies, or picking out new melodies, I can do them all with relative ease. Part of this is that the instrument is tuned to four of five pentatonic notes<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> as its four strings. This also means when I want to play something with the dominant as the low note, it’s fairly easy to do, as the pentatonic scale a fourth below C still uses 4 of the 5 notes. The only difference is F instead of E.</p>
<p>All in all, the ukulele is a fun and easy instrument. I would highly recommend anyone to learn it.</p>

<p>As you may remember from my last mention of this topic, some songs are very difficult to arrange for bagpipe. Today, I was lucky enough to find a song that was easy.</p>
<p>I found myself today with the best problem an artist can have: a hyper focused muse. I could not focus on anything else until I had set the hymn “How Can I Keep From Singing” to bagpipes. Unlike the anthem that I previously discussed, this son was far easier. It’s pentatonic,<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> and only occupies an octave, from the dominant to the dominant. As you may remember, the bagpipe has a range of an octave and a second starting from the subdominant. So, I put the song in the key of d, added a few grace notes, and was done. It’s nice when things go well.</p>

<p>By now, I’m sure you’ve noticed that I’m currently studying in London.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> As a result, much of the typing I’m doing here is being done on keyboards with the UK’s key layout.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>When people find out that I dive, a frequent question is why. There are a variety of reasons for that. The most common<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> reason for this is that I don’t look like a diver. That is, many people seem to think<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> that I am much larger than the average diver. The other reason people seem disbelieving is that I’m not too terribly flexible. I don’t disagree with either assessment, but they don’t affect my choice for one key reason: I dive because I enjoy it, not because I dream of being the best. If my size becomes a limit for how fast I can spin, that’s fine because I don’t need to be throwing 407B.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> Another reason I enjoy diving is that people really seem to appreciate watching the dives where I fail.<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a> If I’m being honest, I’m one of them.</p>

<h1 id="dance-nation-review"><a href="dance-nation.html">Dance Nation Review</a></h1>
<p>Today, I had the wonderful opportunity to watch Clare Barron’s <em>Dance Nation</em> at the Almeida Theatre. The show follows a U13 dance squad as it prepares for national qualifying tournaments. What follows is a review.</p>
<h1 id="draft-3">Draft 3</h1>
<p>The show speaks about the sexualization and sexuality of young women. As I share no part of that experience, my review will focus on other aspects of the show.</p>
<p>As many of you know, I was a techie<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> in high school. Perhaps because of that, or perhaps because something about the medium of live theatre really allows the technical aspects to shine forth, I tend to focus a lot more on the technical theatre aspect than the acting. My reviews<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> will also likely focus on these.</p>
<p>When we are first allowed on stage, we see a curtain in the murky realm between translucence and transparancy. We can barely make out a mirrored wall behind us, and lights running up the seams. When the show opens, the curtain drops. I was struck by the paneling of the stage. Mirrors made up the entire back wall, with lights strung between each. Throughout the show, the use of the lights as a way to demarcate different areas of the stage and different characters was masterful. However, the panels do not remain mirrors. The first piece of the show that struck me was the paneling of the stage.</p>
<p>Throughout the show, the panels turn and twist about, becoming anything from doors, to black glitter decoration, to a wolf’s head, to a bathroom stall. The use of the panels as entries and exits, as a way to bridge and break scenes, and, at the end, as a way to recognize the disjointed nature of both the show and life is fantastic.</p>
<p>The lighting of the show is also incredibly helpful for setting and moving the scenes along, as well as making the minimal set feel larger. When Luke is on the car ride home with his mother, the moon in the upper right of the stage tells us of the long day he’s had, and connects us to the other dancers, who each have their own memories of the night. As the drive continues, orange lights flow by their faces, reminding the audience of their movement. When Zuzu has a breakdown, the lights become harsher and harsher until her realization comes through.</p>
<p>Continuing to mess with the set, the show did a wonderful job of playing with set as prop and prop as set. Actors tended to carry in the set pieces, or pieces that they worked with remained a part of the show. Always in the wings of the stage were the detritus of a dance studio, reminding that it’s never far away, especially in the minds of the dancers. As the show progresses, the stage becomes more and more cluttered, just as the depth of the characters’ experiences do.</p>
<p>A final note about the set, as means to transition into the acting, all along what is meant to be the ceiling of the room are trophies from dance competitions past. In my experience as an athlete, leaving mementos of victory where they are always visible is meant one of two ways. Either the coach wants to say “you’re a part of a program with past success, and with hard work you can be a part of that too,” or “winning is all that matters. The teams that aren’t up here don’t belong in our memories because they were a failure as a team and as people.”<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> This show chose to take the second approach, and took it to the comical extreme that some coaches take it. Not only does the coach point out the one year with no trophy by saying no one remembers them, he then mentions the next year, where a dancer was recruited to become a professional. One of the panels turns and shows us a shrine dedicated to the dancer and all of the dancers chant her name. This is the first of many times throughout the show that the coach and dancers talk about how winning<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a> is the only important aspect of dance. To quote a common sports saying, “winning isn’t everything, it’s the only thing.” What the show quietly points out, however, is that there is a constant culling of winners. No one the rest of the star’s team. Slowly but surely, in memory and in action, the weak are culled. Only the strong remain.</p>
<p>In the first scene, a dancer gets injured and is never heard from again. Near the end of the show, another dancer makes a mistake and quits as a result. These actions, along with monologues, showcase a dangerous aspect of not only children’s athletics, but also of society. Weakness and failure are not opportunities to grow, but rather signs of being inherently inability. And, since the weak get culled, any mistake means you no longer belong.</p>
<p>All in all though, it was a very enjoyable show.</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>The show speaks about the sexualization and sexuality of young women. As I never went through that, my review will focus on other aspects of the show.</p>
<p>As many of you know, I was a techie<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"><sup>5</sup></a> in high school. Perhaps because of that, or perhaps because something about the medium of live theatre really allows the technical aspects to shine forth, I tend to focus a lot more on the technical theatre aspect than the acting. My reviews<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref"><sup>6</sup></a> will also likely focus on these.</p>
<p>When we are first allowed on stage, we see a curtain in the murky realm between translucence and transparancy. We can barely make out a mirrored wall behind us, and lights running up the seams. When the show opens with the curtain dropping, I was struck by the panels of the stage. There was a string of lights between each mirror. Throughout the show, the use of the lights as a way to demarcate different areas of the stage and different characters was masterful. However, the panels do not remain mirrors. The first piece of the show that struck me was the paneling of the stage.</p>
<p>Throughout the show, they turn and twist about, becoming anything from doors, to black glitter decoration, to a wolf’s head, to a bathroom stall. The use of the panels as entries and exits, as a way to bridge and break scenes, and, at the end, as a way to recognize the disjointed nature of both the show and life is fantastic.</p>
<p>The lighting of the show is also incredibly helpful for setting and moving the scenes along. When Luke is on the car ride home with his mother, the moon in the upper right of the stage tells us of the long day he’s had. As the drive continues, orange lights flow by their faces, showing the audience how they’re moving through time. When Zuzu has a breakdown, the lights become harsher and harsher until her realization comes through.</p>
<p>The show did a wonderful job of playing with set as prop and prop as set. Actors tended to carry in the set pieces, or pieces that they worked with remained a part of the show. Always in the wings of the stage were the detritus of a dance studio, reminding that it’s never far away, especially in the minds of the dancers. As the show progresses, the stage becomes more and more cluttered.</p>
<p>A final note about the set, as means to transition into the acting, all along what is meant to be the ceiling of the room, there are trophies from dance competitions. As an athlete, leaving trophies where they are always visible has in my experience been meant in one of two ways. It either is left to say:“we have a history of hard work and success. Keep that alive,” or “these trophies represent the years we remember and care about. The years without trophies are failures, and the athletes are too.” This show chose to take the second approach, and took it to an almost comical extreme. Not only does the coach point out the one year with no trophy by saying no one remembers them, he then mentions the next year, where a dancer was recruited to become a professional. One of the panels turns and shows us a shrine dedicated to the dancer. This is the first of many times throughout the show that the coach and dancers talk about how winning<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref"><sup>7</sup></a> is the only important thing. The show quietly points out that there is a constant culling by no one remembering the rest of the team. The show systematically culls the weak from its ranks. Only the strong remain.</p>

<p>The first piece of the show that struck me was the paneling of the stage. When the curtain drops to begin the show, the back wall is composed of mirror panels. Throughout the show, the panels are turned and become anything from doors, to black glitter decoration, to a wolf’s head, to a bathroom stall. Throughout the show, the use of the panels as entries and exits, as a way to bridge and break scenes, and, at the end, as a way to recognize the disjointed nature of the show and life is fantastic.</p>
<p>The lighting of the show is also incredibly helpful for setting and moving the scenes along. When Luke is on the car ride home with his mother, the moon in the upper right of the stage tells us of the long day he’s had. As the drive continues, orange lights flow by their faces, showing the audience how they’re moving through time.</p>
<p>In terms of the show itself, the show is set in a dance academy featuring the parts of youth athletics I was so incredibly fortunate to miss out on. These preteens are being told that their future success in life depends wholly on how well they perform at a single show. The coach<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref"><sup>8</sup></a> reinforce the idea that it really doesn’t matter whether you’re having fun.<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref"><sup>9</sup></a> All that matters is being the best and winning. Weakness isn’t tolerated, and the weak are culled out.</p>
<p>From the first scene, where a dancer gets injured and is never heard from again, through to the end, where a dancer makes a mistake and, as a result, quits dance forever, the idea of mistakes as being reflective of character flaws, and that character flaws (and by extension, those who hold them) should be hidden.</p>
<p>All along what is meant to be the ceiling of the room, there are trophies from dance competitions. As an athlete, leaving trophies where they are always visible can be meant in one of two ways. It can either be: “we have a history of success, and y’all are going to be a part of it,” or “we only care about you if you win.” As you might guess, this show chose the second approach, and took it to an almost comical extreme. Not only does the coach point out the one year with no trophy by saying no one remembers them, he then mentions the next year, where a dancer was recruited to become a professional. He fully tells both the dancers and the crowd that the only important thing about dance is being the best. Even the rest of the famous dancer’s group is forgotten. Only the strong remain.</p>
<p>Returning to painting the scene, the show did a wonderful job of playing with set as prop and prop as set. Actors tended to carry in the set pieces, or pieces that they worked with remained a part of the show.

<h1 id="a-pierogi-recipe-or-why-i-pronounce-ukulele-the-way-i-do"><a href="pierogi-recipe.html">A Pierogi Recipe: Or Why I Pronounce Ukulele the Way I Do</a></h1>
<h1 id="draft-two">Draft Two</h1>
<p>At first glance, today’s title may seem like a non sequitur.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> What do pierogi<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> have to do with the ukulele?<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> No, this title isn’t<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a> written as an intentional non sequitur to spark my creative energies. Rather, I realized that the same thought processes inform my choice of both making pierogi and pronouncing ukulele.</p>
<p>To understand what I mean by that, at the bottom of today’s essay are two pierogi recipes.<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"><sup>5</sup></a> One of them is a recipe I found online,<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref"><sup>6</sup></a> and the other is the recipe I used last time I made pierogi.<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref"><sup>7</sup></a> As a bonus, I also include the gluten free pierogi dough recipe I used.<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>If you’ve read the recipes, you might notice a few differences between the two recipes.<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref"><sup>9</sup></a> The biggest difference to me is in the dough.<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref"><sup>10</sup></a> They use both sour cream and water in their dough, while I don’t use either. My reason for this comes from my formative years, when I learned to make pasta. According to my teacher,<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref"><sup>11</sup></a> Italian pasta dough<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref"><sup>12</sup></a> only contains salt, egg, flour, and oil.</p>
<p>Since that dough has worked for everything I ever needed a dough for,<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref"><sup>13</sup></a> I never felt the need to use other pasta doughs.<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref"><sup>14</sup></a> So, when I made my pierogi, I just made dough the way I always do.<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Now, by this point you might be asking what making dumplings has to do with the pronunciation of ukulele.<a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref"><sup>16</sup></a> To me, they’re two reflections of the same universal truth: people adapt everything they learn to fit into their prior knowledge and experiences.</p>
<p>In IPA<a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref"><sup>17</sup></a> notation, the word ukulele is pronounced<a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote-ref"><sup>18</sup></a> /?uku?ll/, which contrasts to the SAE<a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote-ref"><sup>19</sup></a> pronunciation of /ju?k?lejli/. This is due to the nature of word movement through languages. When a word is assumed into a new language, it<a href="#fn20" id="fnref20" class="footnote-ref"><sup>20</sup></a> change its pronunciation to align to the new tongues phonological rules. In Hawaiian, there is no schwa,<a href="#fn21" id="fnref21" class="footnote-ref"><sup>21</sup></a> while SAE uses the schwa almost exclusively in unstressed syllables. Additionally, SAE almost never begins words with vowel /u/<a href="#fn22" id="fnref22" class="footnote-ref"><sup>22</sup></a>. So, when the Hawaiian word entered the SAE lexicon, the /j/<a href="#fn23" id="fnref23" class="footnote-ref"><sup>23</sup></a> was added, to make it align with the rules of the language.</p>
<p>Now, both of these changes to the word are fine and natural, at least to me.<a href="#fn24" id="fnref24" class="footnote-ref"><sup>24</sup></a> But, I’ve heard and seen complaints about the both how to pronounce ukulele, and, indirectly about how to make pierogi. To be specific, I’ve been told that the way I pronounce the word “ukulele” is wrong, since the word is pronounced differently in the language of origin. Additionally, there are many people who feel that changing a culture’s recipe<a href="#fn25" id="fnref25" class="footnote-ref"><sup>25</sup></a> is wrong.<a href="#fn26" id="fnref26" class="footnote-ref"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>To me, both of those erase the idea of positive change, which is makes the world beautiful and exciting. Should I stop calling what I make pierogi because I don’t use an “authentic” recipe?<a href="#fn27" id="fnref27" class="footnote-ref"><sup>27</sup></a> Should I try to relearn the phonological system of my native tongue to accommodate a single word?<a href="#fn28" id="fnref28" class="footnote-ref"><sup>28</sup></a> I personally don’t think so, and that’s where today’s title comes. Both the way I make pierogi and the way I pronounce ukulele come from the background and mental connections I made before encountering the idea.</p>
<h1 id="draft-one">Draft One</h1>
<p>At first glance, the title may seem like a non sequitur.<a href="#fn29" id="fnref29" class="footnote-ref"><sup>29</sup></a> What do pierogi<a href="#fn30" id="fnref30" class="footnote-ref"><sup>30</sup></a> have to do with the ukulele?<a href="#fn31" id="fnref31" class="footnote-ref"><sup>31</sup></a> No, this title isn’t<a href="#fn32" id="fnref32" class="footnote-ref"><sup>32</sup></a> written as a non sequitur as a way to spark my creative energies. Instead, while reflecting on my recipe for pierogi, especially in context with “authentic” recipes I’ve read, it occured to me that I feel similarly about pierogi and the pronunciation of the word ukulele.</p>
<p>To understand what I mean by that, below are two pierogi recipes. One of them is the recipe I found online,<a href="#fn33" id="fnref33" class="footnote-ref"><sup>33</sup></a> and the other is the recipe I used last time I made pierogi.<a href="#fn34" id="fnref34" class="footnote-ref"><sup>34</sup></a> As a bonus, I’ll also put in the gluten free pierogi dough recipe I came up with.<a href="#fn35" id="fnref35" class="footnote-ref"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>So, you might notice a few differences between the two recipes.<a href="#fn36" id="fnref36" class="footnote-ref"><sup>36</sup></a> The biggest difference to me is in the dough. They use both sour cream and water in their dough, while I don’t use either. This mostly comes from when I first learned how to make pasta.

<h1 id="recipes">Recipes</h1>
<h2 id="from-internet">From Internet</h2>
<p>For the dough:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>3-1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</p></li>
<li><p>3 large eggs</p></li>
<li><p>2 tablespoons sour cream</p></li>
<li><p>3/4 cup water</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Filling:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>2 cups mashed potatoes</p></li>
<li><p>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</p></li>
<li><p>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</p></li>
<li><p>1/2 teaspoon salt</p></li>
<li><p>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</p></li>
<li><p>1 cup grated cheddar cheese</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Since pierogi making instructions, like most dumplings, are effectively just “make dough,” “make filling,” “put filling in dough,” I elide them here.</p>
<h2 id="from-memory">From Memory</h2>
<p>For the dough:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1 egg</p></li>
<li><p>olive oil in equal amount to the volume of egg</p></li>
<li><p>sprinkle salt</p></li>
<li><p>sprinkle black pepper</p></li>
<li><p>flour to correct consistency</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For the Gluten Free Dough:<a href="#fn52" id="fnref52" class="footnote-ref"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>1 egg</p></li>
<li><p>olive oil in just under amount of egg volume</p></li>
<li><p>sprinkle salt</p></li>
<li><p>sprinkle black pepper</p></li>
<li><p>white rice flour to correct consistency</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Filling:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>5 pounds potato, peeled<a href="#fn53" id="fnref53" class="footnote-ref"><sup>53</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>1 lb cream cheese</p></li>
<li><p>1/2 pound butter</p></li>
<li><p>2 red onions</p></li>
<li><p>5 cloves garlic</p></li>
<li><p>olive oil as needed</p></li>
<li><p>sharp cheddar to taste</p></li>
<li><p>salt and pepper to taste</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To make the filling, boil the potatoes, mince garlic and fry with onion in olive oil until caramalized. Drain potatoes when soft, then add everything together, mixing well.</p>
<p>To make the dough, all ingredients but flour in a bowl, then slowly add flour until solid enough to handle. Move onto a floured workspace and add more flour until the correct consistency.</p>

<h1 id="arranging-for-bagpipe"><a href="arranging-for-bagpipe.html">Arranging for Bagpipe</a></h1>
<p>Prereading note: I definitely have far more footnotes here (59 in total, 34 in the final draft) than normal (between 1 and 17 in total, and between 1 and 10 in the final draft) in my blog thus far. I have no clue why I felt the need for so many notes while writing this post, but they feel pretty needed. Additionally, since nested footnotes are apparently so frowned upon in different style circles that my editor doesn’t support them at all, nested notes will go in (), and if I doubly nest, I’ll use other [], and will continue to add as needed.</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>This spring, I started learning the Scottish bagpipes.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> While learning the bagpipe, one of my cross-country running friends<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> asked me if I would be willing to play the (United States’) National Anthem<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> at the Grinnell team’s only home meet, the Les Duke Invite. That meet is today, and (I think) just ended at the time of my writing this post. Obviously, I was unable to be there. But, their mentioning of the idea did spark me to try to find a bagpipe arrangement for The Star-Spangled Banner.<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"><sup>5</sup></a> Initial searches were fairly fruitless, with what versions I could find sounding nothing like the anthem I knew.<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref"><sup>6</sup></a> I found a <a href="http://www.therealviperpiper.com/viewtopic.php?t=11731">forum</a> discussing this, and they concluded that the anthem is unplayable on the bagpipes.</p>
<p>Now, those of you who know me may know that I don’t take being told something is impossible well.<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref"><sup>7</sup></a> It feels like a challenge. Some of you may also know that I<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref"><sup>8</sup></a> compose music. The brilliant<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref"><sup>9</sup></a> part of my mind thought that I would be able to arrange the piece for bagpipes. Obviously,<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref"><sup>10</sup></a>that wouldn’t fit the song,<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref"><sup>11</sup></a> which requires an octave and a fifth range,<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref"><sup>12</sup></a>, and some chromatic notes.<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref"><sup>13</sup></a> But, you can always drop and raise octaves to fit a piece in. Additionally, my teacher mentioned offhandedly that there are chromatic fingerings for the bagpipe. So, I worked off of a version of the piece in the key of G.<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>There I ran into my first problem: I have no clue how to play a C natural on a bagpipe, which was required in the second half of the piece.<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref"><sup>15</sup></a> But, more importantly than that, it was centered around G,<a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref"><sup>16</sup></a> which those of you familiar with harmonics may see is dissonant to A.<a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref"><sup>17</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote-ref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>When I asked a friend of mine who plays bagpipes,<a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote-ref"><sup>19</sup></a> he told me that, in his experience, people would play the second half of the song,<a href="#fn20" id="fnref20" class="footnote-ref"><sup>20</sup></a> because the first half isn’t doable. That’s when I suddenly realized that there’s a modulation in the middle of The Star Spangled Banner.<a href="#fn21" id="fnref21" class="footnote-ref"><sup>21</sup></a> With that in mind, I transposed the end of the piece to D major, which worked pretty well.<a href="#fn22" id="fnref22" class="footnote-ref"><sup>22</sup></a> I then put the initial half back in the song.<a href="#fn23" id="fnref23" class="footnote-ref"><sup>23</sup></a> I expected some cognitive dissonance from the<a href="#fn24" id="fnref24" class="footnote-ref"><sup>24</sup></a> modulation in my version of the piece, but it was fairly minor. And, since the piece was centered around D, it fit in nicely with the harmonics of the instrument.</p>
<p>Then came to the part of arranging for bagpipe that I struggle with: adding the embellishments. The bagpipe plays a continuous note, so to break up repeated notes,<a href="#fn25" id="fnref25" class="footnote-ref"><sup>25</sup></a> small chirpy notes are played to break the sound. There are many kinds of embellishments, including grace notes,<a href="#fn26" id="fnref26" class="footnote-ref"><sup>26</sup></a>, doublings and half doublings,<a href="#fn27" id="fnref27" class="footnote-ref"><sup>27</sup></a> and many others. As you might expect from a musical tradition lasting centuries, there’s a lot of theory behind deciding what embellishments go where<a href="#fn28" id="fnref28" class="footnote-ref"><sup>28</sup></a> which I don’t know and can’t easily find only. So, I put in embellishments that I knew<a href="#fn29" id="fnref29" class="footnote-ref"><sup>29</sup></a> and looked right where they were, then tried playing through. Nothing looked or sounded horrible to me, but I also don’t know enough to know if anything I do would be horrible. So, now I have a version of the National Anthem of the United States of America that fits entirely on the bagpipe. If anyone wants it, feel free to drop me a message at <a href="mailto:flyingrebelpipes@gmail.com">flyingrebelpipes@gmail.com</a>. My only request if you end up using the piece is that you send me a recording of yourself playing it.</p>

<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>Today, I went on a riverwalk. Nominally, it was to fulfill an academic assignment.

A part of me really wanted to go all the way to the English Chanel, but I knew that was a poor choice. For one, it would have been far longer than a 90 minute walk. Second, it’s really hard to decide where a tributary ends and where the real river<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref"><sup>6</sup></a> ends. Finally, the footpath that would have let me walk along the Thames was closed. Nonetheless, it was a great time.

<p>Today for a homework assignment, I went on a riverwalk.<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref"><sup>9</sup></a> I chose to go from the London Aquatics Center<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref"><sup>10</sup></a> to the River Thames.<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref"><sup>11</sup></a> I found that you can go the entire distance from the Aquatic Centre to the Thames without ever leaving the river.<a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref"><sup>12</sup></a> It was a really fun walk. It was tempting to walk to where the Thames meets the Chanel, but I was unable to for two reasons: that would have put me well over the maximum time of 90 minutes, and the footpath following the Thames was closed.</p>

<h1 id="draft-3">Draft 3</h1>
<p>I’m almost always listening to music, even if only inside my head. There’s something sublime about music’s ability to transport me from wherever I am and whatever I’m doing into a different place. Although every song doesn’t send me to the same place, or even the same place for each song, they always send me somewhere.</p>
<p>People ask me what kind of music I like<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>, and it’s a fair question. I’m a music major, I listen to a lot of music, and it’s a normal question. Nonetheless, I can only ever answer that I listen to almost everything. It’s both the most and least factual statement I can make.</p>
<p>The statement is filled with fact because there is no genre, artist, or even song that I completely refuse to see the merit of listening to. Every song has its place, and even if I don’t love every aspect of a piece<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a>, I still can recognize why its loved. Even if I can’t think why a song is loved, I can see its belonging in a situation, whether as ambiance or as transition.</p>
<p>For a very similar reason, the statement is totally devoid of fact. That is, there is no song that I always love. Songs that I love in most circumstances are unbearable in others. As much as I love soft lilting pieces, I recognize that they don’t belong in most people’s pregame<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> playlists. And, as much as I love heavy electronic beats, I understand that most people don’t use them as lullabies<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Even If I don’t like a song though, I always prefer music to its absence, which may be one of my defining traits. If given the option between music or no music, there are nearly<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"><sup>5</sup></a> no situations wherein I would not prefer music. Music is the joy of life, and it’s a joy that I refuse to do without.</p>

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>I love music. There’s something sublime about its ability to transport me from wherever I am, whatever I’m doing, into a different place. Every song doesn’t send me to the same place, and the same song may not send me to the same place twice, but they always send me somewhere different.</p>
<p>However, people ask me what kind of music I like<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref"><sup>11</sup></a>. My usual answer of “anything” generally isn’t well received. Nonetheless, it’s both the truest and least true statement I can make.</p>
<p>It’s the truest because there is no genre, artist, or even song that I completely refuse to see the merit of listening to. Every song has its place, and even if I don’t love every aspect of a piece, I still can recognize why its loved.</p>
<p>It’s the least true statement I can make for the same reason. There is no song that I would always want to listen to. Songs that I love in most circumstances are unbearable in others.</p>

<h1 id="disclaimer"><a href="disclaimer.html">Disclaimer</a></h1>
<p>Pre-reading note: I’m writing this post<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> as I tend to write my papers. That is, a very rough sketch, a more polished draft, and so on until I have the quality I want<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> in my writing. Since I’m not too embarrassed of my (lack of) writing ability, I thought I’d post my drafts here as well<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a>. I’ll leave the final draft on the top, with the lower drafts in order from newest to oldest underneath.</p>
<h1 id="draft-4">Draft 4</h1>
<p>Those of you following this blog closely may note that this is the eighth blog post I’ve made since starting the blog. Starting one week ago today, I began writing daily. While I don’t feel the need for a disclaimer at this exact moment<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a>, I think it wise that I craft one sooner than later</p>
<p>You may ask why I feel this need<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"><sup>5</sup></a>. To answer, I would reply that disclaimers are a good way to distance oneself from their work. I have in the past<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref"><sup>6</sup></a> expressed views and beliefs I personally don’t ascribe to because I believe that they are not being given their fair share of time. Even though playing the Devil’s Advocate hasn’t come back to haunt me yet, I know that people tend to believe what you write is what you believe<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref"><sup>7</sup></a>, so I want to lessen the probability of misunderstandings. Additionally, my views often change over time. Since I’m not sure if I’ll believe everything I write in the future, it seems smart to say that my thoughts may change now rather than later.</p>
<p>Now that I’ve explained, why I’m writing my disclaimer, I should probably write it. I could copy my disclaimer from my inspiration’s blog site: “The opinions stated herein are those of <strong>me</strong> and do not necessarily reflect those of <strong>employer</strong>, the Rebelsky family, <strong>organizations</strong>, or even most other sentient beings.”<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref"><sup>8</sup></a> However, much of that disclaimer isn’t relevant to me, and it doesn’t quite express the situation I find myself in. So, this is my version: “The views and opinions expressed on this site (and linked sites) do not necessarily reflect those of the author’s current, past, or future employers, the Rebelsky family, rebelsky.com, or even the author. Readers are advised to read at their own discretion.”</p>

<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>I’ve been writing this blog for a week now, so I feel like I should probably write a disclaimer sooner rather than later. You may ask why. To that I would reply with the following:</p>
<p>Disclaimers are a good way to distance oneself from their work. Although I work for no-one, it seems important to me that I distance myself from some of my words. Those of you who know me may know that I say things I don’t believe because I believe that they are supportable enough views that they deserve their time. Even though that hasn’t come back to bite me yet, I know that people tend to believe what you write is what you believe<a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref"><sup>13</sup></a>, so I want to be aware. Additionally, my views<a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref"><sup>14</sup></a> change over time. Since I’m not sure if I’ll believe everything I write in the future, it seems smart to say that my thoughts may change now rather than later.</p>
<p>Now comes the writing of the disclaimer. I could copy my disclaimer from my inspiration’s blog site: “The opinions stated herein are those of <strong>me</strong> and do not necessarily reflect those of <strong>employer</strong>, the Rebelsky family, <strong>organizations</strong>, or even most other sentient beings.”<a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref"><sup>15</sup></a> However, that feels intellectually dishonest. So, with some slight revisions: “The views and opinions expressed on this site (and linked sites) do not necessarily reflect those of the Rebelsky family, the domain, rebelsky.com, or even the author. Readers are advised to read at their own discretion.”</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>I’ve been writing this blog for a week now, so I feel like a disclaimer is probably a good thing to get out of the way. I could copy from my inspiration’s blog site: “The opinions stated herein are those of <strong>me</strong> and do not necessarily reflect those of <strong>employer</strong>, the Rebelsky family, <strong>organizations</strong>, or even most other sentient beings.”<a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref"><sup>16</sup></a> However, that feels intellectually dishonest. Let’s see, I could say: “The views and opinions expressed here do not necessarily reflect those of the Rebelsky family, GitHub, rebelsky.com, most sentient beings, or even the author. Any and all offense taken is deeply regretted.” That seems pretty good.</p>
<p>Why a disclaimer though? I feel like all of the cool writers use disclaimers as a way to distance those they work for from their works. Even though I work for no one right now, I still know that people tend to believe what you write is what you believe<a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref"><sup>17</sup></a>. Since I’m not sure if I’ll believe everything I write in the future, it seems smart to get that idea out of the way quickly, as well as avoiding indemnifying my family.</p>

<h1 id="feeling-safe"><a href="feeling-safe.html">Feeling Safe</a></h1>
<p>As many of you know, I am a large white man. There are many aspects of these two identities that are incredibly beneficial. What I didn’t really realize today, though, was how important that first identity is.</p>
<p>While getting ready to leave for a theatre show that we were both seeing<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>, I mentioned that I thought I might walk there, since I had time. It was around a 2.5 mile walk<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a>, so I thought there might be an objection due to the length. However, the person I was talking to, who was also a white man, said he wouldn’t feel safe walking there alone.</p>
<p>Now, I’m not sure whether it’s that living in a census-defined “rural” area makes me unafraid and trusting of my fellow person<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a>, or whether he grew up in a far different place, which led him to his comment. Nonetheless, it struck me that maybe the most important of my three identities is, in fact, large. It goes first when I describe myself<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a>, and maybe it belongs there. Where before I thought it was just the white man portion that made me feel safe, I’m reevaluating now to believe that it’s a combination of all three characteristics that lets me feel safe in any situation I find myself in.</p>
<p>But, since the goal of my blog is to be happy and cheerful<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"><sup>5</sup></a>, I’ll mention the walk. It was a beautiful walk across and then along the River Thames. I got there at sunset, so the river looked amazing. The show was fabulous, with amazing sounds and a flawless set. The acting was of the highest caliber, as was to be expected from its cast.</p>

<h1 id="my-wonderful-brothers"><a href="my-wonderful-brothers.html">My Wonderful Brothers</a></h1>
<p>Those of you who know me likely also know my brothers<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>. This post seems like a great way to talk about how amazing they are, since I sometimes forget to do that enough.</p>
<p>My older brother is everything an older brother should be. He’s smarter, kinder, and more generous than me. He follows the rules, and is just all around the perfect older brother to have. Because of him, teachers assumed I was trustable, groups accepted me, and just generally his presence made my life better growing up.</p>
<p>Now that we’re older, he’s still amazing to have around. He’s incredibly knowledgable about a variety of topics that I’m beginning to find interesting. He, along with a mutual friend of ours<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a>, share books that we enjoy reading, as well as share interesting short writings as we find them. When I need help with Excel, or really any software that a business person is likely to use, he’s there and willing to drop most things to help.</p>
<p>But, as I mentioned above, I have two brothers. The younger is really everything I could hope for in a younger brother. He is also smarter, more musical, and far more technically adept than me. For all of the softwares that aren’t common business ones, he either already knows them, or is willing and able to quickly learn them to hold my hand as I try to learn them<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a>. He’s a brilliant musician, and I love listening to him perform<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a>. He’s much wittier than me, but also much more sly about it.</p>
<p>Just as my older brother is incredibly knowledgable about topics I know nothing about and am interested in, my little brother is too<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref"><sup>5</sup></a>. He’s well versed in music theory, and helps me a lot when I need a sounding board. He also has shares my impulsiveness, but in a much more constructive way. For instance, right before I left, he decided that with the extra fabric he had<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref"><sup>6</sup></a>, he would make a shirt. He’d never made clothes before, didn’t have a pattern, and still did a passable job.</p>
<p>In the interest of full disclosure, my little<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref"><sup>7</sup></a> brother is the reason for this post. I prefer writing my documents in LaTeX <a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref"><sup>8</sup></a>, and WordPress doesn’t really support that. So, I asked him to build me a website, since we own a domain for some unknown reason. He did, and assuming that I’m able to follow the (incredibly simple) instructions he gave me, my blog will be moving to <a href="http://j.rebelsky.com">j.rebelsky.com</a>. Depending on how my ability to not break software goes, I may stop updating this site.</p>
<p>In summary, I have the best brothers anyone could ask for, and I’m grateful every day that they’re in my life.</p>

<div id="analog-vs-digital">
<h1 id="analog-vs.-digital"><a href="analog-vs-digital.html">Analog Vs. Digital</a></h1>
</div>
<p>As I mentioned <a href="how-im-keeping-track-of-my-time-abroad.html">yesterday</a>, I’m keeping a digital and analog journal of my day. This is inspired by a course I’m taking on London diaries, partially my own past experience, and partially a conversation I had with the professor of the course.</p>
<p>The course on diaries includes an interactive component. That is, in addition to reading London diaries, we will be crafting our own. Now, like many children of the 21st century, I love the idea of keeping everything journaled online. This way I can make notes on my phone as I walk, have them automatically update on my computer, where I can expand with more time. If I wake up in the middle of the night with an idea, I don’t need to wake up a roommate with a lamp. However, the course requires an analog diary, so I needs must also keep a handwritten journal.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that each journal will be totally the same. Conversely, they will not be totally different. I plan to keep both journals mostly in sync, and keep only specific things out of each. For instance, problems I might have with the professor I won’t be putting in the journal that will be graded. Conversely, experiences I don’t much care about that I write for a grade won’t be recorded digitally.</p>
<p>In speaking to the professor about the idea of digital data, the point of Beowulf was raised. However, as I think about it, I agree with the professor, for the opposite reason. My professor’s point was that the Beowulf manuscript survived because it was hand written, and if a similar digital file would exist, it needs constant maintenance to keep operable.</p>
<p>I, however, feel the opposite, at least with regards to a journal. When I write in my physical journal, there are no other copies of the information. If I don’t show it to others, no one may ever know what I’ve written. I can burn the journal and remove all traces of it. Not so with a digital record. Even if I delete this WordPress site, there are still the memories left in the minds of those who read it <a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> and potential digital caches and metadata associated with it. My “private” journal is only synced through the internet and a company or three, so there are almost certainly digital records of it. So while I agree with my professor about the permanence of digital and analog writings, I don’t quite know if I agree with the logic, especially on the level of skill and importance that my writings will <a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> lack.</p>

</div>
<p>I don’t tend to keep track of my daily movements for a variety of reasons. The biggest of these is that one day in Grinnell is rarely much different from a handful or more other days, and those that are I don’t always want to remember.</p>
<p>The second reason I don’t track myself is the time required. Writing takes time, and I’m usually doing or recovering from doing.</p>
<p>Finally, as far as I can tell, most of the time I’m the only one who really cares what zany adventures I’ve gotten up to. Obviously my professors care if I show up to class <a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>, my coaches care that I show up to practice, and my friends and family care that I show up at prearranged times. Other than that, though, I really doubt that anyone cares whether I studied for three hours in Noyce or in Bucksbaum.</p>
<p>None of these apply to my time abroad. With no frame of reference, every day in London feels very different. So far I have far more free time than I know what to do with <a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a>. Finally, I’ve had at least a few people mention that they want to know what I’m doing while abroad.</p>
<p>So, for those of you keeping track at home, that was 224 words to explain why I’m writing, but not addressing the title of how <a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a>. I’m keeping track of my life in a plethora of ways. Like in Grinnell, I send the minutiae of my life to friends via various instant messaging platforms. Unlike in Grinnell, I update different social media far more frequently, I hope not to the annoyance of my friends there. I’m writing this daily journal <a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a>. Finally, I’m maintaining a hybrid journal. That is, I’m writing a journal that is partially digital and partially analog. I’ll talk about the nitty gritty of that later, but it’s been probably the source I use most to record my days.</p>

<div id="street-music-in-london">
<h1 id="street-music-inlondon"><a href="street-music-in-london.html">Street Music in London</a></h1>
</div>
<p>As with most cities, London has its share of musicians performing on the street. Although I’ve only been here a few days and in a small portion of the city, I’ve noticed two things about the street music that I don’t like.</p>
<p>The first, and pettiest, of these is that I haven’t seen or heard any bagpipes. Maybe I’m just conditioned from growing up in Grinnell, where our local bagpipe troupe practices with some regularity, but it’s shocking to me that a small Iowa town is more bagpipe-centric than London.</p>
<p>Second, almost all of the musicians I’ve seen have been using amplifiers. It’s not that I’m an audio purist, who has a problem with the idea of amplifying music. My problem is mostly just the fact that it reduces the number of musicians who can play in an area. When musicians are playing acoustic instruments <a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>, the sound is easily overwhelmed if you’re more than a few score feet away. In places like New Orleans, there’s a different musician at almost every intersection, if not also one in the middle of the block. In London, however, the sounds are amplified, which means that the entirety of King’s Cross Station only seems to have room for one person.</p>
<p>With that said, I still love the fact that there are people who are making music near where I am. It’s great, and so far they’ve all been incredibly talented.</p>
<p>Edit 1 September: Today I saw bagpipers. It looks like there is a rotating group who stands between the underground station near Parliament and Parliament.</p>

<h1 id="first-56-hours"><a href="first-56-hours.html">First 56 Hours</a></h1>
<p>My first 56 hours of life in London have passed me by, so it felt like a good time to get some reflections out of the way. Since I’ve never lived anywhere but Grinnell, I thought I’d be a little more culture shocked than I was. To be honest, London feels a lot like Grinnell so far. Or at least, London feels a lot like Grinnell during NSO. <a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> I don’t recognize most of the people, and everyone is rushing somewhere. It might help that I’m in a part of London that’s fairly old, so the buildings aren’t towering over me.</p>
<p>Some big takeaways from my first 56 hours:<br />
1. Apparently when I don’t have a 24/7 access to Google Maps and the internet, I actually have pretty good navigation.<br />
2. It takes around 30 minutes to walk around King’s Cross Station if you find yourself in that situation.<br />
3. Apparently bagpipes aren’t all that common here. In Grinnell I’m surprised if a week goes by where I don’t hear bagpipes, but so far I’ve heard and seen none.<br />
4. London weather is much nicer than Grinnell’s.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> When I walk out in the morning it’s almost, but not quite, too cold for my shirt and slacks. By 1700 <a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a>, it’s heated up to what feels like the peak of the day, and it’s only slightly uncomfortable to powerwalk through the streets.<br />
5. It’s a lot harder to find a Catholic church in London than in America. I’ve so far seen a few Church of England churches, a Baptist church, an Ethiopian Reformed Church, and a Christian Scientist gathering place. Looking at Google Maps, however, I think I should be able to find one.<br />
6. The underground is really simple to navigate. I’m still not sure how the busses work though.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!<br />

<h1 id="hello-world"><a href="hello-world.html">Hello World!</a></h1>
<p>“Hello World!” is one of the first <a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> pieces of code that I <a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> learn to code when learning a new language. There are a variety of reasons for this, none of which I am aware of. However, it’s still a great way to start this blog.<br />
Speaking of starting, I’m starting this blog for three major reasons <a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a>:<br />
1. Someone asked me if I would be sending email updates about my time abroad <br />
2. I like having a forced place to write <br />
3. As my tagline notes, my father also writes <a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a> daily essays. <br />
So, expect to see some updates about travel, my life abroad, and whatever else happens to be on my mind when I sit down to write.</p>
