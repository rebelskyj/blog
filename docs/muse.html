<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>At this point, I’m more and more sure that I’m the only one who reads this blog, for all that I rarely do so. In many respects, that makes this mostly a write-only space. But, I am currently listening to an audiobook about the creative process, and there are some interesting ideas in it about creativity.</p>
<p>A brief search of my musings<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> shows me that I have mentioned my muse in apparently only two posts, both of which are from my initial blog. In <a href="arranging-for-bagpipes-ii.html">one</a>, I talk about how I was blessed with a hyperfocused muse that day. In <a href="making-a-mixtape.html">the other</a>, I mention how my muse should be considered to have the name Janet that day.</p>
<p>The book talks about how writing more makes you more creative, though it does so in more of a spiritual sense than I think I am personally willing to ascribe to it. Still, it made me think about the fact that what I do now does shape who I am in the future.</p>
<p>So, to the future me, I hope that the writing I do now is helping you write better. To my muse, I hope that my willingness to keep writing will encourage you to keep giving me ideas.</p>
