<p>Today was the second and final day of the Conference Championship diving meet. I placed fourth. I threw my 203a for the first time, and it went pretty well. All in all, it was a fun season.</p>

<p>Today was my last practice before Conference. My coach decided it would be a really short practice. Hopefully I do well tomorrow.</p>

<p>Today I learned that if I give my toenail the choice of sticking to me or staying on a diving board, it will choose the diving board.</p>

<p>Sometimes I realize that I am forgetful.<a href="#fn041" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Today, it was realizing that I had purchased some Celtic music while abroad that I still hadn’t converted to MP3. So yay! I now have four new hours of music to listen to. Today is a good day.</p>

<p>Isaiah 6:8: “Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, ‘Whom shall I send? Who will go for us?’ ‘Here I am,’ I said; ‘send me!’”</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today’s readings speak about the nature of God’s relationship with us. As Isaiah was, we are to be awed and fearing.<a href="#fn051" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> As Simon was, we are to be unquestioning,<a href="#fn052" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> and again, fearful.<a href="#fn053" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>But this is not all that the relationship is. For just after Isaiah speaks about his unworthiness, he is made pure.<a href="#fn054" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> And when Simon and his partners too followed God, they are exhorted, “Do not be afraid; from now on you will be catching men.”<a href="#fn055" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> All in all, that’s nice to think about. We can trust wholly in the Lord our God, and he will make us pure and worthy.</p>

<p>As many of you know, I dive. I also dive poorly very often. Most of the time this is me making a mistake in the air<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and hitting the water hard.</p>
<p>Once, it was hitting the board. Today, it was my foot slipping on an inward dive. As a result, my chest and leg are now scratched up. On the plus side, it did spark a moral dilemma among some friends.<a href="#fn062" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
