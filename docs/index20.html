<p>As some of you may know, I dive. And, as a result of this, I’ve learned the numbering system for diving. It’s fairly straightforward. For example, 103 means front one and a half. Each time the final number increases by one, the number of half-rotations does as well. So, 104 is front double, and so on. Now, this brings us to a topic of debate among my teammates and I. Should front 5 and one half be 111 or 1011? While in London, I heard that one of my teammates knew someone who threw the dive, so I could’ve asked what the number was. But, I forgot, and now don’t know the number. However, some research I’ve never tried to do before now suggests that the answer is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27418210">1011</a>, which is fine, just wrong.</p>

<p>As some of you may know, as a way to kill time and attention, I sometimes draw celtic knotwork. Today, I tried to make a shape that included some interesting breaks. Unfortunately, I realized that the shape required more than one line. To remedy this, I tried some different patterns before asking my father.</p>
<p>After a quick Google search, we learned that<a href="#fn011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> the number of lines required for a knot is the greatest common divisor of the length and width of the knot. Unfortunately, that didn’t end up being incredibly useful for my piece, but it’s still cool to learn.</p>

<p>For the past two weeks or so, I’ve been listening to a long audiobook. Unfortunately, other than a transatlantic flight, I’ve had very little time where my ears are free and the rest of me is not. That is, these past two weeks, either I’ve been unable to listen to something, because my ears are otherwise occupied, as in meetings and conversations, or I’ve also been able to use the rest of my body. Again, that is, I can use my hands to make music, or my eyes to read a book. Since I can’t read a book while listening to one, I couldn’t do that. Nonetheless, it was very fun.</p>
<p>While I still don’t love audiobooks, I understand some of the appeal. Had I still been in London, with my long commutes, I think the audiobook would have been more useful. Nonetheless, I’m mostly just glad it’s over.</p>

<p>Today I tried baking again. Instead of the attempts I’d made before, where I made one full-size cake, and asked for others to compare to no reference, today I made 5 small recipes and had comparisons from there. The five recipes I tested were: the original, browned butter and coffee, browned then cooled butter and coffee, just coffee, and just browned butter. I had two amazing friends who were willing to taste test for me.</p>
<p>Sadly, one person’s favorite<a href="#fn031" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> was the other’s least favorite: browned butter and coffee That was the browned and coffeed recipe. Both found the browned, coffeeless recipe a close second, so that appears to be a good choice. However, the original was also one’s favorite and the other’s third favorite. So, I’ll probably try those two recipes on Saturday, as I have a chance to talk to the judge again.</p>

<p>Merry Christmas! Today, I had the wonderful opportunity to celebrate Christmas with family and friends. It was amazing. And, as my sleep schedule is pushing me to bed earlier and earlier, I am reminded of the quote “merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night.”</p>

<p>Christmas Eve has always been a weird day to me. Mostly, this is because I accept that<a href="#fn051" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> days start and end at sunset. That’s the reason for Vigil Masses and such. However, Eve means <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&amp;search=eve">the evening before.</a> So, the idea of Christmas Eve just seems weird to me. The evening before Christmas is technically the 23.</p>

<p>Luke 1:45 “Blessed are you who believed that what was spoken to you by the Lord would be fulfilled.”</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today’s Gospel, as befits the eve of Christmas Eve, is very focused on the coming of the Lord. The first reading tells how Bethlehem will be where “one who is to be ruler in Israel” comes from.<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The Gospel takes place right after Mary accepts the angel telling her that she will become pregnant.</p>
<p>Her cousin Elizabeth sees her and recognizes what child she carries. The Gospel ends with the message I hear in different variations almost daily from friends and others who profess the Christian faith. However, none speak it<a href="#fn062" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> as well as Elizabeth does, as befits one consumed by the Spirit. We are told many things by the Lord. We are told that we will be blessed if we believe.</p>
<p>Of course, we also know that believing requires doing. Without this belief, Mary could have believed that the angel was from God and still said no. But instead, because she believed and trusted in the Lord, she accepted the angel’s request, saying “May it be done to me according to your word.”<a href="#fn063" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>Today, I tried the recipe again. It came out more solid, though less strong flavored, and with a texture described as “grainy.” All in all, I’d say it’s marginally better.</p>

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As I mentioned <a href="baking-competition.html">before</a>, in a few weeks I’ll be competing in a baking competition. So, today I tried making the recipe for the first time. Reviews were generally positive, though many commented that the flavor was almost too strong. Given that I remember the recipe having a strong chocolate flavor before browning the butter and adding coffee, that would make sense. So, next time I make it, I’ll have to also try adding on the whipped cream and strawberries.</p>
<p>Right now, I need to think of a way to lighten the dish, as most reviewers found it too strong. I hope that adding the whipped cream will be enough to lighten it. Tomorrow should tell me.</p>

<p>As in <a href="first-56-hours.html">one of my first posts</a>, I’m using this as a space to reflect on my time back home. Not much has changed at Grinnell, other than some new faces showing up and some old faces not being there. The codes to some doors I need to use have changed, others have stayed the same. All in all, these first few hours back in Grinnell are far less shocking than the same in London.</p>
