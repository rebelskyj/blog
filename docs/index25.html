<p>Tonight, I had the lovely fortune of seeing George Furth and Steven Sondheim‚Äôs <em>Company</em> performed at the Gielgud Theatre. It was a show where the main character‚Äôs sex was flipped. No longer about Bobby, this show was about Bobbi.</p>
<p>It was incredibly enjoyable. The set mostly took the form of small, modular pieces which were surrounded by neon lights. They moved back and forth and up and down stage, and in some instances even up and down vertically. The music was beautiful, as is to be expected.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the orchestra was above the actors, rather than in a pit. The actors and actresses all performed brilliantly.</p>
<p>As to the production itself, for most of the show I‚Äôm unsure how different it was from the original script. I went in mostly blind, as I do for most musicals. However, I had seen a recording of the song ‚ÄúBarcelona.‚Äù</p>
<p>In this version, where the main character sleeps with a man, rather than the original which had the genders switched, there were some differences in how I felt as an audience member. Despite the fact that the staging seemed almost identical, it‚Äôs interesting how different some of the lines and blocking felt when delivered from a person of the opposite sex.</p>
<p>Overall, it was very enjoyable</p>

<p>Mark 12:44-44 ‚Äú A poor widow also came and put in two small coins worth a few cents. Calling his disciples to himself, he said to them, ‚ÄòAmen, I say to you, this poor widow put in more than all the other contributors to the treasury. For they have all contributed from their surplus wealth, but she, from her poverty, has contributed all she had, her whole livelihood.‚Äô‚Äù</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today‚Äôs Gospel gives the message that I‚Äôve always had the hardest part reconciling with the teachings we see in daily religious life. The Lord says that the widow‚Äôs gift, though small, means the most, as she has the least to give.</p>
<p>As a Catholic, I am taught that faith is a call to action. The sentiment that ‚Äúfaith without action is dead‚Äù is not an uncommon one. So, why is it that we see good deeds done by the faithless as anything but the miracles that they are?</p>
<p>When a faithful person performs a good deed, it shouldn‚Äôt be remarkable. They are simply doing what their soul tells them to do. When they make the choice to not do good, it takes an effort. But, someone who doesn‚Äôt believe doesn‚Äôt have that call. For those without faith, if we believe that faith is what calls you to action, there is no call to do good.</p>
<p>And yet, the faithless still do good. To me, that‚Äôs the most beautiful part of life</p>

<p>Assuming anyone actaully reads my daily posts, they might have noticed that yesterday, for the first time in more than 70 days, I didn‚Äôt update. In a way, it was sort of a relief. I knew that at some point, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to update every day, so getting it out of the way was a relief. I had visited Belgium to see a friend, and didn‚Äôt find the time to make a post. I also didn‚Äôt write for NaNoWriMo, but since I was well ahead of schedule,<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I‚Äôm not too worried.

<p>Today is Friday. It‚Äôs also the Friday ending what my host university calls ‚ÄúReading Week.‚Äù As class ended last week, my professor made a note of that, before commenting that little to no reading happens during reading week.</p>
<p>I planned on reading during reading week. But, Monday turned into Tuesday turned into today, and I did no studying. Somehow, I even read less of my pleasure reading than I tend to do. But, I did destress, which is important, since I didn‚Äôt realize how ragged I‚Äôd been running myself. So, I guess I read the right amount?</p>

<p>As I mentioned <a href="nanowrimo.html">earlier</a>, I‚Äôm doin NaNoWriMo this year. But, I‚Äôm also competitive with myself. So, around four days in, I figured out how I‚Äôd challenge myself. Each day, I‚Äôll not only write more,<a href="#fn041" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> but also increase the rate with which I‚Äôm writing more. Since I didn‚Äôt think ahead, that means that each day I need to write more than 3% more than I did the day before. So, by the end of the month, I‚Äôll have around five thousand words to write a day.</p>
<p>On the bright side, if I can do it, I‚Äôll have certainly made papers in the future much easier.</p>

<p>As I mentioned <a href="feeling-lucky.html">earlier</a>, I saw the <em>Book of Mormon</em> a little bit ago. It was a fun show, and somewhat interesting.</p>
<p>I already knew the main storyline, plot, and music, because I live a life in proximity to musical theatre. Sadly, I remember only a few bits from the actual production.<a href="#fn051" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>First, it was interesting that, other than Jesus, who had what I think was meant to be a California Surfer accent, all of the characters spoke with East Coast accents. Second, I didn‚Äôt realize how explicit the innuendo was in ‚ÄúBaptize Me.‚Äù Finally, the characters were almost over the top in how stereotypically American they sounded and acted at times. It was an interesting reminder that America is viewed differently from the outside looking in as from the inside looking in. Overall, however, it was a wonderful production. The cast and crew did a great job.</p>

<p>Tonight I had the wonderful opportunity to see <em>La Bayadere</em> at the Royal Opera House.<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> It was odd.</p>
<p>Apparently in ballet, unlike theatre, you‚Äôre supposed to read what‚Äôs going to happen ahead of time. I did not. I was confused.</p>
<p>I did like the second act, though. There were a couple of dances with the whole chorus that were super fun and made nice lines and shapes.</p>
<p>Overall, while not a fan of opera, at least I have another piece in the music to theatrical story spectrum. It begins with symphony, then sound painting, then ballet, opera, musical, then non musical theatre. Yay.</p>

<p>And, about an hour and a half into rising, I realized that I didn‚Äôt really want to wait until tomorrow to eat it, so I made it a semi-knead bread. I just kneaded it, and gave up on rising, so threw it in the oven. As I remember from this summer, I can‚Äôt let it sit for 90 minutes, so I‚Äôll come back in the future, but since I‚Äôm not editing the draft any other way, it‚Äôll be in this draft.</p>
<p>After cooking for around 20, it looked risen but still too pale. I set another timer for 10 minutes, and threw in more water.</p>
<p>Looked cooked, so out it came. After letting it cool, I opened it, and it smelled bready. It tasted like bread, and that‚Äôs the general goal</p>

<p>Deuteronomy 6:5 ‚ÄúTherefore, you shall love the LORD, your God, with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength.‚Äù</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>The Gospel today spoke to me for the same reason that it speaks to many people. It‚Äôs an incredibly simple command that Jesus lays out. Instead of having hundreds and hundreds of rules and laws, there are only two.<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>You are to love the Lord with all your heart, soul, and strength. And you are to love your neighbor as yourself. Wow that sounds nice and easy to understand and completely impossible to follow.</p>
<p>What does loving the Lord with all your heart, soul, and strength mean? How do we love Him?</p>
<p>And when we start asking those questions, we realize why there are so many rules and laws in both the Jewish faith,<a href="#fn082" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> and also in the Catholic faith.<a href="#fn083" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> It‚Äôs the same reason that we can‚Äôt just say ‚ÄúI‚Äôll write a novel,‚Äù and instead need to break it into smaller steps. People aren‚Äôt good at big picture projects. Dedicating our lives to a cause is the biggest picture any of us can do, but without frameworks to help us, we either find ourselves paralyzed with indecision,<a href="#fn084" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> or led down dark paths, forged with the best of intentions. Of course, there is the slight chance that we do brighten the world, and make it a better place.</p>
<p>But, to steal an analogy given to me, the Church provides an interstate. It guarantees that if you don‚Äôt ever get off the interstate, you‚Äôll go to heaven.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs nothing stopping you from driving down the country roads and side streets, and you‚Äôll likely see more exciting vistas than if you stay on the interstate. But, you always run the risk of your car breaking down before you get to where you‚Äôre going.</p>

<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>People who know me might know that I‚Äôm somewhat flighty. Despite this, I really try to build my days around touchstones, or events that are required at a certain place and time. This works nicely in a majority of my life, as academics and extracurriculars provide this. Somehow, having anything to do in a day makes me keep track of the entire day so much better.</p>
<p>But, some days don‚Äôt have any events. Even Sundays, where I attend Mass, don‚Äôt feel like an event, because there are multiple options for time. These past two days in particular, I feel as though time has simply passed me by. I don‚Äôt really know where the last 48 hours went, though I know they must have gone somewhere. Such is life I suppose.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Normally I keep my days very structured. While it isn‚Äôt the structure that most people think of,<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I have the entirety of my days flow around focal points, as a way to orient myself. So, when I have days with no imposed structure, they tend to disappear.</p>
<p>Today is a great example of this. I woke up at nearly 11 am, because I had no reason not to. Over the next hour and a half, I apparently wrote.<a href="#fn092" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> After that, I think I watched a tv show until 5, when I helped people make dinner, and then did activities with friends. But, the day still feels as though it‚Äôs barely started. I don‚Äôt like this feeling.</p>
