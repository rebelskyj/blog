<p>First Published: 2024 January 1</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>Happy New Year! It has been basically a year to the day since <a href="reflection-2022.html">my last yearly reflection.</a> Last year I did five things that I was excited for and five things that I was excited to have done in the previous year. So, five things that I am excited for in the upcoming year:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Publishing my first first author paper</p></li>
<li><p>Giving an invited lecture at a university</p></li>
<li><p>I’m excited to grow in my relationships<a href="#fn001" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I’m once again also excited to watch my little brother graduate</p></li>
<li><p>I’m excited to record an album</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Five things not on last year’s list that I’m glad I did,</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I got to explore my new home state and visit a lot of the state parks in it as outreach!</p></li>
<li><p>I got to give a lecture to a classroom which is only slightly different than the last item but felt significantly different.</p></li>
<li><p>I did open mics!</p></li>
<li><p>I kind of became a computational chemist</p></li>
<li><p>I got much better at writing! Both in terms of content and in terms of quality.<a href="#fn002" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Last year I also had five items that I was excited for!</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Passing my third year exam. I did it!</p></li>
<li><p>Self publishing a book. I have more than a thousand followers, which is really exciting!</p></li>
<li><p>Taking an improv class. I sadly didn’t get around to it.</p></li>
<li><p>Watching my littlest brother graduate. It was fantastic.</p></li>
<li><p>Growing in my relationships. I did! It was very rewarding, and I am very glad that I did it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I had a number of goals for last year, and I generally did not do a great job with them.<a href="#fn003" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>This upcoming year, as with every year, I have any number of goals, however (un)reasonable they may be.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Blog Daily<a href="#fn004" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Finish the research for my dissertation<a href="#fn005" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Make significant progress on writing my thesis</p></li>
<li><p>Figure out what I want to do after graduate school</p></li>
<li><p>Apply to whatever I want to do next</p></li>
<li><p>I would like to finish the book on craft that I’ve started and then read the ones that I was gifted this past Christmas</p></li>
<li><p>I want to read through the books that I’ve checked out</p></li>
<li><p>I would like to be better at putting myself out there</p></li>
<li><p>Write and record an album</p></li>
<li><p>Do BiaY and CCCiaY. It should be easier because I can talk to a family member about them</p></li>
<li><p>Be better at exercise</p></li>
<li><p>Learn to weave</p></li>
<li><p>Learn to spin yarn</p></li>
<li><p>Learn a polka on the accordion</p></li>
<li><p>Swim a mile</p></li>
<li><p>Be better about exercise</p></li>
<li><p>Improve at prayer.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>That’s far more than I think might be reasonable, and so I will hope that I can make it through everything, increasing in productivity constantly.</p>
<p>Let’s move on to the other portion of the reflection, which is the monthly reflection. I think that monthly goals remain useful for constructing my month in the way that I would like to live it.</p>
<p>Goals for the upcoming month:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Finish at least three of the books that have been sitting maligned on my “Currently Reading” shelf. I did it! I think that I even cleared through more than three of them.</p></li>
<li><p>On a related note, read two of the books that I’ve checked out from the library. I don’t think that I did a good job with that, but I did read like a third of one book. I then found like another five or ten that I want to read, which isn’t great.</p></li>
<li><p>Following that line of thought, I want to spend my time more intentionally. I did a better job with it, even though it wasn’t super intentional.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to write a sonnet every day. I wrote a lot of sonnets, and I even revised a fair few of them</p></li>
<li><p>I want to read a book on the craft of writing start to finish. I had accepted that I might not finish this book at the end of the month, which is good, because I didn’t do it. Hopefully next month.</p></li>
<li><p>Get better at prayer. I really did not.</p></li>
<li><p>Clean my home. I think that I did improve the home at least a little bit.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch and do some other form of exercise every day. Oof, I fell off this wagon.</p></li>
<li><p>Get better at touch typing. I did! My words per minute has grown much higher, and I hope that I wil continue to improve.</p></li>
<li><p>Write letters to friends. I wrote a few of them, which is nice!</p></li>
<li><p>Get ahead on Jeb. OOf, I did not get ahead of the book, which is ok.</p></li>
<li><p>Get better at embroidery. I did get better! I think that I could have done better, but it’s ok.</p></li>
<li><p>Play guitar every day. I did play guitar more often! Even though I didn’t get there all the way, I tried my hardest, and that counts for something.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to keep up the daily blogging. I kept up with it! Yay!</p></li>
<li><p>I want to finish a full draft of the paper I’m working on. I did not, which is sad enough.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to drink more water. I don’t think that I drank very much water, sadly enough.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Anyways, goals for the upcoming month, which should hopefully reflect my goals for the upcoming year.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Keep up on BiaY and CCCiaY. If I want to egt there at the end of the year, I need to start there.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep blogging daily</p></li>
<li><p>Get ahead on Jeb</p></li>
<li><p>Write and record at least a song</p></li>
<li><p>Exercise and stretch more</p></li>
<li><p>Finish the book on craft</p></li>
<li><p>Read and/or return at least three of the library books that I have checked out. Three might be far too many, but hopefully at least one of them, maybe two?</p></li>
<li><p>Play guitar more</p></li>
<li><p>Pray better</p></li>
<li><p>Drink more water</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>So, it’s been a year.<a href="#fn006" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> I’m planning to work on this in a few drafts, so let’s take a page from last year’s yearly reflection and do five things I was grateful for last year and five things I’m excited for this year.</p>
<p>Last year I thought that I would be excited for:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Passing my third year exam. I did it! I’m very proud of myself, and it’s wild that I’m now a dissertator</p></li>
<li><p>Self publishing a book. As of the time that I’m drafting this right now, I’m sitting at just under three hundred and fifty thousand words, I have 1351 followers, and my chapters have been read an average of over four thousand times each.<a href="#fn007" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> It’s been a great experience, and I have definitely been forced<a href="#fn008" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> to reflect on myself based on how the writing I put out is received.</p></li>
<li><p>Taking an improv class. Sadly, this never happened. I do think that I went to an improv show last year, which was fun. Hopefully I’ll find a time with my friend to go to improv class this year.</p></li>
<li><p>Watching my littlest brother graduate. He did! It was fantastic to get to watch him, and it was really great getting to spend time with family and see him in his element.</p></li>
<li><p>Growing in my relationships. Oh boy did I! I started being deliberate about writing letters to friends, and I made an effort to stay in touch with a lot of people. I think that they have by and large been successful goals, though I’ve also finally come to the realization that I don’t have to be friends with everyone. Some people will dislike me for who I am, and that’s ok.<a href="#fn009" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>All of those tasks that I did accomplish were things that I am glad I did. Other highlights from the year,<a href="#fn0010" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>I got to explore my new home state and visit a lot of the state parks in it as outreach!</p></li>
<li><p>I got to give a lecture to a classroom<a href="#fn0011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I did open mics!</p></li>
<li><p>I kind of became a computational chemist</p></li>
<li><p>I got much better at writing! Both in terms of content and in terms of quality.<a href="#fn0012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>That is all very exciting! What am I looking forward to in 2024?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Publishing a first author paper!<a href="#fn0013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Growing in my relationships.<a href="#fn0014" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Giving an invited talk at a university<a href="#fn0015" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I’m excited to watch my littlest brother graduate again!<a href="#fn0016" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I’m excited to write and put out an album.<a href="#fn0017" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Ok cool, that also includes some of my goals for 2024. Turns out I did set goals for 2023, I just put them in a separate document. My goals last year were to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Blog Daily. I did better at that towards the end of the year, but I think that I averaged somewhere like one day in three overall.<a href="#fn0018" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Do BiaY and CCCiaY. I completely dropped the ball on both of these. I do think that they’re important, and a family member is doing them, so that should help be a motivator.</p></li>
<li><p>I wanted to be better about exercise. I think that I ebbed and flowed in that goal over the course of the year. I’m generally pretty ok with that fact, though. I have higher priorities, and I’m comfortable with that fact.</p></li>
<li><p>I wanted to write more and varied forms of poetry and prose. I think that I generally did a pretty good job of writing more, for all that I kind of dropped the ball on the poetry. I think that I did do a pretty good job with varied forms of prose.<a href="#fn0019" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I wanted to practice music more. Again, this is a goal that ebbed and flowed, but I would like it to flow more than ebb this coming year.</p></li>
<li><p>I wanted to try monthly, quarterly, and yearly goals. I generally did alright<a href="#fn0020" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> with the monthly goals, but I gave up on quarterly goals almost instantly and never really referenced the yearly goals.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Last year I wanted to make an effort to learn species counterpoint better. I don’t think that this is a goal that I am going to take with me to 2024. I’ve briefly talked about it before, but to recap: I do want to compose, but mostly for my own solo performance, rather than traditional choral composition. I don’t think that there are enough hours in the day, days in the week, or weeks in the year for me to explore everything that I want, so I need to prioritize.</p>
<p>What else are things that I want to work on or do this year?</p>
<p>I said in my 25 for 25 post that I want to learn how to weave, swim a mile, take an improv class, learn a polka on the accordion, and spin yarn. Those all remain things that I think that I want to do. Let’s see what I think that I would need to accomplish each of the tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Learn to weave: sign up for a class with my friend who also wants to learn how to weave</p></li>
<li><p>Swim a mile: Start swimming regularly, focusing on just swimming</p></li>
<li><p>Take an improv class: force my schedule to overlap with the friend I want to take the course with and the course itself</p></li>
<li><p>Learn a polka on the accordion: get my accordion back and look up an easy polka for it</p></li>
<li><p>Spin Yarn: either use the kit that I have or sign up to take a class with a friend</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What else do I want to accomplish?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I would like to figure out what I want to do after graduate school</p></li>
<li><p>I would like to finish at least most of my thesis research</p></li>
<li><p>I would like to make significant progress on writing my thesis</p></li>
<li><p>I don’t think that I want to do NaNoWriMo again. It was fun the past few years, but I know myself now well enough to know that the way I should grow as a writer is by writing better, not necessarily writing more.</p></li>
<li><p>On that note, I would like to finish the book on craft and read at least the other books that my friends have given me for Christmas.<a href="#fn0021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I would like to read through a lot of the books that I’ve checked out, and I would like to be able to return them with the knowledge in my mind</p></li>
<li><p>I would like to be better at putting myself out there, at least in terms of presenting a genuine version of myself more readily.</p></li>
<li><p>I would like to apply for a job in whatever field I end up deciding feels right for my next steps</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Wow that’s a lot of things that I want to do. I guess that I should either reduce the goals or increase my productivity. Those both sound like a lot of work, so we’ll see what ends up happening. For now, time to look away from this and do work for the day, rather than looking months into the future.</p>

<h1 id="reflections-on-todays-gospel"><a href="reflections-on-readings-holy-family-b-23.html">Reflections on Today’s Gospel</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 December 31</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>Today is the Feast of the Holy Family. There are a number of optional readings today, which means that there is no way that I would be able to discuss every variation on the readings. Instead, I am going to reflect on the readings that were read at the Mass I went to today.</p>
<p>Year B’s version of the first and second readings focus on Abram turned Abraham. We see his conversation with the Lord, where he bemoans the fact that all of his blessings will fall to his servant, rather than one of his descendants. This conversation is striking to me for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>First, the G-d of the Old Testament, for all that we talk about the anger, is also a kind and loving Father. I could never imagine a Greek myth where someone complains to Zeus about the way that they have not been blessed the way that they wanted to be. Of course, the Greek gods are gods in a very different sense than the Almighty. I don’t need to go into that, but it is something that I thought about as I started redrafting this musing.</p>
<p>Second, the Lord assures Abraham that his children will be as countless as the stars. As a child, that felt interesting to me, because it seemed like we should be able to count the stars. Or, at least, there is a way to count all the stars that the naked eye can see in the night sky.<a href="#fn011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Similarly, there is, in theory, a way to measure all of the biological descendants of Abraham. We could genetically sequence the world and find all of his living children, at least.</p>
<p>However, the stars in the sky are far more than the stars that we can count. One of the biggest discoveries of Hubble was that there is no such thing as empty space. For those who don’t know, one of Hubble’s projects was staring into a dark void, previously thought to be empty space. What it found was more and more dimmer and darker stars. Similarly, as the priest reminded us during his homily today, all Christians are adopted children of Abraham.</p>
<p>The second reading reminds us of the many ways that the Old Testament prefigures the new. Abraham is willing to trust his son, his only child with Sarah his wife,<a href="#fn012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> to the Lord. When the Lord says that the is to kill his son, Abraham trusts that he could bring his son back from the dead. Thankfully, however, the Lord does not require Abraham to go through with the sacrifice. In the New Testament, however, the Lord does give up his only son.</p>
<p>I’ve seen discussions of the Binding of Issac which point out that Abraham was ancient when he was asked to kill his child. There was no way, the commenters claim, for Abraham to overpower his child. That is, his child went to the sacrifice willingly. That doesn’t directly relate to the Gospel today, but it feels at least somewhat relevant.</p>
<p>Anyways, time to move to the Gospel. This passage, like one of the readings from Luke a few weeks ago, contains one of the Canticles that we use frequently. We have the Canticle of Simeon. The Canticle of Simeon, like the Canticle of Mary, is a song of praise to the Lord. Today’s reading notes that Simeon is full of the Holy Spirit as he says the words.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that Christ is introduced to the Jewish people according to custom. For all that modern Catholicism tends to overlook a lot of the way that Christ existed as a Jew in the Second Temple Era, it was a vital part of the early Christian theology. Christ was brought into the Temple, the same way that every other Jewish boy child would have been.</p>
<p>However, this entry to the Temple is not entirely filled with joy. A prophetess of the Lord sees Mary and tells her that a sword shall pierce her heart.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think about the song “Mary did you Know?” It’s often unpopular among the theologically inclined, because the answers to most of the questions are yes. For all that these complaints are valid, I do think that there’s something really powerful in knowing that Mary spent 33 years with her son, knowing the entire time that he would be murdered before she would die. It is often said that the worst fear a parent has is outliving their child. I cannot even imagine what it would be like to not only outlive your child, but to watch him grow and develop knowing, the same way that you know the Lord is G-d, that he will die before you. Anyways, I think that’s as far as I can get in understanding the readings right now. I’ve still got some hours until the New Year<a href="#fn013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, so there’s always a chance that I’ll be inspired to write more in the upcoming time. If not, I’m pretty ok with where I’ve gotten.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-realized-theres-some-critical-framing-errors">Draft 1, Realized there’s some critical framing errors</h1>
<p>I found out today that there are optional first and second readings for Years B and C for today’s readings.<a href="#fn014" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> In the Year B readings, we focus on Abram<a href="#fn015" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> and the promise the Lord gave him, that he would have descendants as countless as the stars. As a person tangential to astronomy, that’s an interesting thought to me. Every time we look in what should be a dark region, we see more stars, fainter and further away.</p>
<p>The Second Reading comes from St. Paul, who reminds us of the first reading. Abraham is gifted children countless beyond any number because of his trust in the Lord.</p>

<p>First Published: 2023 December 30</p>
<h1 id="draft-2-30-december">Draft 2: 30 December</h1>
<p>N.B. In the interest of showing chronology of my thoughts, any rough drafts will end where I end them on a given day and start as a new section or draft afterwards.</p>
<p>The phrase Fides et Ratio means many things to many different people. To those who are not Catholic and speak<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> no Latin, the phrase likely means nothing. To those who know Latin, it translates perfectly to Faith and Reason.<a href="#fn022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> For those who are familiar with their Papal Encyclicals<a href="#fn023" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, it is the opening phrase<a href="#fn024" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> to Pope Sain John Paul II’s writing on the way that faith and reason<a href="#fn025" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> overlap. It is also the name of any number of catholic and catholic adjacent groups who focus on that same overlap.</p>
<p>If I’m being honest with myself, I think that Fides et Ratio, and the worldview it professes, are what makes Catholicism so fundamentally different from most other forms of Christian thought.<a href="#fn026" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> It is not that Faith and Science occupy different spheres and never overlap. That story, while often told to young children, especially those with questions, is only true in the way that most stories we tell children are.<a href="#fn027" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Faith and reason both give us glimpses into the truth. As such, JP2 writes, they cannot contradict each other. If there is an apparent contradiction, one of the two must be wrong.</p>
<p>For me, a great place to point to for this is the concept of the death penalty. It was long taught as licit for nations to have capital punishment, with one of the primary justifications being that it reduces crime rates. As more and more modern research has shown that not to be the case, however, the Church changed her stance on the issue.<a href="#fn028" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, we have what is allegedly taught as one of the great sticking points of modern Catholicism for atheists: transubstantiation. That is, the bread and wine that the priest holds at the altar does, in fact, truly become the body and blood of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. However, absent other miracles<a href="#fn029" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>, it is still indistinguishable to mortal eyes. A chemical analysis would not show that they have changed.</p>
<p>There are two ways of<a href="#fn0210" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> disputing this. First is the way that I feel least comfortable with, which leans close to the God of the Gaps heresy. That is, just because the Host remains unchanged by any technique we currently have available does not mean that it is unchanged. New equipment or forms of measurement could be<a href="#fn0211" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> developed which would account for the difference.</p>
<p>The other is a much easier argument from a theoretical basis. The second argument is, however, far more difficult to convince someone of. It is to claim that there are truths that cannot be measured via scientific inquiry.</p>
<p>Of course, we know that this is true. Science cannot prove its own validity. Even outside of that, though, philosophers<a href="#fn0212" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> since Godel<a href="#fn0213" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> have proven that there is no way to construct a set of truths that can prove every truth.<a href="#fn0214" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Before I drift too far into my “multiple methods of inquiry are good, and what do we mean when we say science anyways” rant, let’s pull back to faith and reason. The two should be thought of as supporting each other, rather than existing independently or in opposition. For instance, because I know that the Lord created the universe to follow rules,<a href="#fn0215" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> I can perform scientific inquiry. More than that, though, because the universe we were created can be studied from within itself, we are capable of showing when things are, in fact miracles.</p>
<p>This is a fine line to walk, of course. Just because something cannot be explained by modern science does not mean that no science is capable of explaining it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Lord helps those who need it. I am fully willing to believe that in days before antibiotics and immunizations, far more miraculous healings were performed. This is not the God of the Gaps, whose power diminishes as we learn more. This is a G-d who loves us so dearly that he gives us what we could never hope to have on our own accord.</p>
<p>So that is one way that I can use faith to increase my ability to do science.<a href="#fn0216" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> How can we do the reverse?</p>
<p>Truthfully, that is where the spark for this musing came. Yesterday I was talking with a friend who knows that I was raised Catholic.<a href="#fn0217" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> The friend asked me if there was any way that I connected the work I do to the faith that I was raised in.</p>
<p>It’s a difficult question to answer.<a href="#fn0218" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>If faith and reason can both complement<a href="#fn0219" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> each other, then the system needs to work both ways. As someone who does science and reads reason, how can that enrich my faith life? There are the obvious places like reading great works of speculative theology or works like the Summa.<a href="#fn0220" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> However, that feels like a cop out.</p>
<p>Today is a Saturday musing, and those are supposed to be deeper delving than my usual musings. So, let’s take some time and stew for how my science makes my faith grow. There’s the fact that it forces me to remember that there is beauty on every level? That’s true but an easy answer.</p>
<p>There’s the stock answer that I give people, which is that you cannot hope to understand a sculptor without understanding his sculpture, which feels on the right track, if still a little too pithy. Can I take that a little deeper?</p>
<p>Let’s see, I study the bible<a href="#fn0221" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> because it helps me to understand G-d, since it’s His divine revelation. The universe, however, is just as much a creation of the Almighty, and it is sustained constantly through his active choice to keep it. In studying the universe, we get glimpses into something deeper? Is that true?</p>
<p>Sometimes I find that questions are best answered by approaching from another angle. When learning about the vastness of space, it is common to fall into a state of existentialism. The universe is just so vast that it defies words and explanations.<a href="#fn0222" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>When I learn about the vastness of the universe, though, I do not feel smaller. Instead, I understand that the Lord created such a large space for us. Why, exactly, he did it is a mystery, but I guess that I can take some stabs myself.</p>
<p>The earth is so big that it feels almost infinite. The Odyssey, for instance, takes place completely within the Mediterranean Sea. Moses and his people traveled for forty years inside of a small middle eastern desert. I can absolutely see how there could be a motivation to treat the concept of infinity with less grandeur if the universe was as small as the earth.</p>
<p>There’s also the concept of harmony of the spheres. I know that science has more or less entirely moved past<a href="#fn0223" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> the concept, but science has also seemingly given up on animism. Animism means a lot of things to a lot of people.<a href="#fn0224" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> In general, though, when I think about animism I think about the idea that the inanimate, isn’t.<a href="#fn0225" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> One of the biggest flexes that modern scientists try to have over prescientific thought is that we now know that lightning doesn’t come because the gods are angry.</p>
<p>On the other hand, every explanation of more or less any scientific concept does rely on the idea of animism. We say that atoms form bonds. In part, this is because we are taught to write in the active voice, which requires an agent and therefore agency. However, when we speak in that way, we end up defining our thoughts.</p>
<p>I knot that there’s more for me to say, but I can no longer find the words. As much as I would like to keep going or post this next week, I think that I need to throw in the towel.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I embroider today? It has been another day without embroidery, but maybe tomorrow would be a better day. I hope it will, at least.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I play guitar today? Shoot! I spent the day with my family, but that’s about all that I can say for most everything.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I practice touch typing today? I dd a few lessons, and that is what matters. I don’t think that I made any progress.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Reading</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have I made progress on my Currently Reading Shelf? A bit! I talked about it with the person I’m reading it with, which is fun and exciting. That’s always great, and I’ll probably make more progress reading after I post this.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I read the book on craft? Drat. If I want to finish the book by the end of the month, I really need to do a bunch of reading tomorrow.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I blog? I even blogged yesterday, even though I didn’t post it. I didn’t like the post, and I wasn’t proud of it, so I didn’t post it. I think that, for all that I keep planning to write the posts every day, I will give myself grace to not post them when they are bad.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write ahead on Jeb? I really need to start writing. Even though I am not posting Monday, I still hope to find time to write it before Monday. Unfortunately, that’s abut all that I can say.</p></li>
<li><p>Letter to friends? I wrote to a few friends, and that was fun! That’s about all that I can say in terms of that, though.</p></li>
<li><p>Paper? I did a little, and I started thinking about appendices that I might need to add to my thesis. I think that there’s something to be said about needing to justify a lot of what I did, and even more to be said about explaining what happens.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Wellness</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How well did I pray? Not at all, really. I need to do better, but it’s hard.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I spend my time well? I spent it more or less napping and spending time with my family. There’s nothing wrong with that, but I wish that I didn’t need more sleep.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? I was so sedentary, which I’m not happy about.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I exercise? See just above.</p></li>
<li><p>Water? Rip</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="draft-1-29-december">Draft 1: 29 December</h1>
<p>Fides et Ratio are the opening words to an encyclical by Pope St. JPII. It is also the name of various faith and science groups that I have friends who take part in. After a conversation with a friend today, I find that I am thinking a lot about it as a concept.</p>
<p>I’ve mused before about the way I find mysticism and science to be intrinsically linked, but this is something different. Mysticism, after all, is a tradition that nearly every faith has. As a scientist, I do believe that there is objective truth. As a Catholic, I believe the same.</p>
<p>As far as I have ever been taught, the two domains should never intersect. Or, as JP2 put it, truth cannot contradict truth. That’s probably the better way to frame the differences. It isn’t that science and faith cannot answer the same questions, it’s that they should come to the same answer.</p>
<p>For instance, we have the Big Bang. It’s the most famous example that I can think of where science and faith absolutely agree. We believe that the universe was created ex nihilo<a href="#fn0226" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a>, and that seems to be what the Big Bang suggests. Because the universe was created out of nothing, it makes sense to me that there would be no way to predict what came before the Big Bang, much as scientists might try to speculate.<a href="#fn0227" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>But, there’s far more to it than just that. I am getting a Ph. D. On some level, I do believe that this involves dedicating my life, at least in part<a href="#fn0228" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>, to science and teaching. Even if the rest of the world and field no longer thinks that Doctor means teacher, I still do.</p>
<p>But, of course, I also find that I am continuing to grow in my faith. On some level, everything that I do should and needs to be oriented towards the salvation of the world. As someone whose favorite research questions do not heal the sick, feed the hungry, clothe the naked, or house the homeless, that means I have to find another way that the research points to salvation.</p>
<p>As I reconnect with old friends and meet new people, a common question I am asked is what my favorite part of my research is. Of course, they rarely actually mean the research, and tend to mean my favorite part of being a graduate student.<a href="#fn0229" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

<h1 id="what-i-read-and-wrote"><a href="reading-writing-23-12-28.html">What I Read and Wrote</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 December 28</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As I mentioned <a href="schedules-3.html">yesterday</a>, Thursdays are going to be reserved for what I’m reading and writing lately. It is currently a form of vacation for me right now, which means that I am doing far less of both than normal.<a href="#fn031" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>In terms of reading, this past month<a href="#fn032" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> I finished:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Genesis of Gender by Abigail Favale. The book came recommended to me, and it’s a deconstruction of modern gender theory from a former gender theory professor who converted to Catholicism. I found it better the more I read the book, probably because the focus shifted towards the latter parts. I may or may not discuss it in greater depth in the future, depending on how starved for content I become.</p></li>
<li><p>There’s a serialized version of C.S. Lewis’s Screwtape Letters<a href="#fn033" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> that ended this year’s run in December. It was a much different experience to read the book in short weekly snippets.</p></li>
<li><p>I listened through C. Mantis’s Path of Ascension<a href="#fn034" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. I think that it’s my third or fourth read through, since I’ve been following the serial since early on in its career on the internet.</p></li>
<li><p>I also listened through Casualfarmer’s Beware of Chicken, which is another former web serial turned book available from an indie publisher.</p></li>
<li><p>I read through Peter Kreeft’s Fundamentals of the Faith. It was a really beautiful book, but I unfortunately<a href="#fn035" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> gave it away to a friend.</p></li>
<li><p>I finished Dr. Bessel van der Kolk’s The Body Keeps the Score, which I’ve been working on in theory since last year. I found that it was much easier to get through in audio format, but that may have just been where I was at for that week.</p></li>
<li><p>I listened to one of the recommended reads for my entire campus, Clint Smith’s How the Word is Passed. It was an interesting reflection on the way that America has or hasn’t dealt with slavery and the consequences of chattel slavery. I know that it changed my views of the Confederacy at least a little, if only because I tend to be sympathetic to foot soldiers.<a href="#fn036" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I listened to Travis Baldree’s Legends and Lattes. I know the author primarily as an audio book reader, so I was very interested in his book when it came out. It’s apparently become a fairly well known book, at least in the sense that I’ve seen it more places than any of the books I’ve heard of his.</p></li>
<li><p>After watching CGP Grey’s video about how to be miserable<a href="#fn037" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>, I read the book that he based it on, How to Be Miserable: 40 Strategies you already use by Randy Paterson. It was really eye opening to me how half of the items or so I read and went “who would ever do that?” and the other half were habits I hardly realized I had, they were so ingrained.</p></li>
<li><p>I generally kept up on the web serials that I’m reading. Path of Ascension and Beware of Chicken both post fairly consistent updates, which is fun. It’s wild how far ahead the freely available content is from the nominally published.<a href="#fn038" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>That more or less sums up the reading<a href="#fn039" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> that I’ve been doing. In terms of writing, I’ve written a fair amount of code, though that’s been a lot of writing long functions just to delete them when I realize that I don’t want the functionality they provide.<a href="#fn0310" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> I’ve recently been taking a break from Jeb, which has been really restful, though I am excited to get back to writing it. I wrote a fair number of sonnets this month, and I finally got to the point that writing a sonnet is hardly an effort, even if it isn’t good.</p>
<p>Oh! I suppose that I’ve also been reading the book on writing, Writing Well by Sven Birkerts and Donald Hall. It’s a fantastic book, and I’m really enjoying the way that it’s making me think about the way that I write and consume language. I just finished the section of words, and one piece of advice they kept repeating in that section is that “a change in style, however slight, is a change in meaning, however slight”. I feel like often, at least in my experience, people don’t treat rephrased sentences as different meaning. As someone who does legitimately believe that no distinguishable wordings are fungible,<a href="#fn0311" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> it was nice to have that take explicitly stated. Even the difference between “I read a book” and “a book was read by me” has a shade of difference, even outside of the taste. Of course, the taste of words is not something that they underestimate. One piece of advice they stress almost as much as not mixing metaphors or using dead cliches is having sentences flow. I’ve just started the sentence section, so I haven’t heard exactly what they mean by it, but I am excited to find out.</p>
<p>I also just started the first of my Saturday Musings, which is focused about copyright. I don’t know if it will end up being the first Saturday Musing I post, because it’s a lot to write about, but I hope to do the subject justice. I’d also like to start plotting out the next few chapters of my web serial, and now is as good of a time as any, I suppose. Plotted out the next three and a half chapters, and I’m excited to write them again. If I was smart, I would find a writing guide that actually teaches how plotting works, since right now I just kind of free associate what I want to see and then write in details.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I embroider today? Shoot! I should do that tomorrow. It’s too late o clock right now.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I play guitar today? No, sadly today was more focused on real work.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I practice touch typing today? Once again, a few lessons. I think that it might not be the best choice ever to go straight from 50 wpm goal to 75 wpm. Might be a smarter choice to do smaller, more iterative versions, where I go up by like 5 wpm at a time. Then again, it isn’t like I need to worry about optimizing this. Any typing practice is probably ninety percent as effective as any other.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Reading</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have I made progress on my Currently Reading Shelf? I am!</p></li>
<li><p>Did I read the book on craft? I read it a little last night and then a fair amount this morning!</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I blog? Kind of! More brain dump than anything else, but that’s life sometimes.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write ahead on Jeb? I plotted out a few chapters, which is nice.</p></li>
<li><p>Letter to friends? I met with one and set up a meeting with another!</p></li>
<li><p>Paper? I once again proved to myself and the smart people<a href="#fn0312" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> in my life that, not only can I not use derivative based methods for most of the work, I cannot even use most derivative free methods for optimization.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Wellness</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How well did I pray? Remaining less than great. This is something I’d like to work on in the future.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I spend my time well? Kind of! I spent a lot of time with family again, caught up with a close friend, and did some research work. Between that, pretty well.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? sadness.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I exercise? sorrow.</p></li>

<h1 id="on-schedules"><a href="schedules-3.html">On Schedules</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 December 27</p>
<h1 id="draft-3">Draft 3</h1>
<p>I’ve mused <a href="schedules.html">a</a> <a href="meta-schedules.html">few</a> <a href="schedules-2.html">times</a> about schedules on this blog. I have also mused more than a few times about writer’s block or general struggles to find a prompt for the day.<a href="#fn041" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Finally, I’ve started realizing that I want to try writing better essays, and that the most effective way to do that is by spending more chronological time with the essay as a work in progress. There’s an old expression about birds and stones that feels relevant here.</p>
<p>To write better musings, I need to be able to spend more time on a musing. The amount of mental energy that it takes to come up with a prompt and start exploring it is such that I cannot really dedicate myself to writing two completely disparate and unique musings at once.<a href="#fn042" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Additionally, I do better with deadlines. There’s an expression I once heard in a class<a href="#fn043" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, which goes something like “a work of art isn’t finished until it’s wrested from the author’s grasp”. Or, in slightly more real terms, as Jim Butcher once said, “I don’t have a muse, I have a mortgage”.</p>
<p>All that to say, I think that it is important for me to schedule not just a day where I post more in depth musings, but also a more scheduled way of musing overall so that I have the mental space to write it.<a href="#fn044" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Having spoken to my family, they still think that it is too ambitious to write a blog post every day, keep up with my research and work, record an album, and keep up with my web novel.<a href="#fn045" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> However, I think that I have the space to be able to do so, at least for now, as long as I make some changes.</p>
<p>Moving forwards, I will reduce the mental load on myself by scheduling each day’s activity. Sundays, as you might expect, will continue to be dedicated to Reflections on the Readings.<a href="#fn046" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Fridays, as well, will remain focused on Flash Fiction Friday musings.<a href="#fn047" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Saturdays, I have decided, will be for long form writing.</p>
<p>Now, this is three of seven days. Even that is more planning than I have been typically doing<a href="#fn048" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>, but that’s not enough. Also, as mentioned, my family is worried about my ability to remain focused on research. To help with that, I will be dedicating the Monday Musing of each week to Thesis Work.<a href="#fn049" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> My thought there is that starting each week with writing explicitly focused on my thesis will help me to remain focused on my life goal.<a href="#fn0410" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>On Wednesdays I will muse about the progress on my album. Wednesdays tend to be one of my freest nights, which gives me the space to do some last minute writing or recording if I feel behind. Additionally, since it will often be a short reflection, that will give me more time for writing.</p>
<p>Thursdays will be dedicated to quick recaps of what I have been reading or writing. Partially, this is because Thursdays tend to be busy nights for me, and often what I read and write does not change week to week. However, I do also want to be more intentional about what I’m reading and writing, and I think that needing to reflect on them weekly will help me with that.</p>
<p>The astute among<a href="#fn0411" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> readers may note that this only describes six days of the week. The week, however,<a href="#fn0412" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> is seven days long. I know that many musings that I might be interested in pursuing do not deserve or warrant<a href="#fn0413" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> a full week of consideration<a href="#fn0414" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>, and I want the freedom to be able to write about whatever I want at least once a week. I think that I know myself well enough to know that I do best when I have some freedom, however constrained. Giving myself one day a week to let musings die will probably be a good valve for my stress to escape.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I embroider today? I went through another needle’s worth of embroidery! I think that I only need two or three more total strands, given that I’ve filled in about a quarter of the grid.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I play guitar today? I also took today off, which is probably less great given that I want to start writing for an album.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I practice touch typing today? A few lessons! I’m kind of unsure how it prioritizes which letters go when, but I think that it might be lowest wpm letter<a href="#fn0415" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> going through?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Reading</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have I made progress on my Currently Reading Shelf? I’m enjoying the book once more, which is really nice.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I read the book on craft? I brought it with me, but it is currently dark, so I don’t think that I’ll be reading it for at least a little longer (if at all)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I blog? Three drafts may have been the right number for this musing.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write ahead on Jeb? I should probably start Jeb again tomorrow.</p></li>
<li><p>Letter to friends? Met with two and set up a meeting with a third!</p></li>
<li><p>Paper? I will try to work on it tomorrow as well.<a href="#fn0416" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Wellness</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How well did I pray? oof.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I spend my time well? Eh! I wrote this which I’m pretty proud of, and I spent a lot of time with family.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? Should probably delete this goal. Won’t but will continue to feel bad.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I exercise? Nope</p></li>
<li><p>Water? Eh. not a lot</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>I’ve mused <a href="schedules.html">a</a> <a href="meta-schedules.html">few</a> <a href="schedules-2.html">times</a> about schedules on this blog. Additionally, I have mused more than a few times about writer’s block or general struggles to find a prompt for the day.<a href="#fn0417" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> There’s an old expression about birds and stones that feels relevant here.</p>
<p>As I’ve grown older, I’ve realized that schedules generally make my life better. I not only prefer to know where I’m going and what I’m doing when, but also find that it makes me more productive. As I’ve grown older, though, I’ve also gotten more and more freedom to set my own schedules.</p>
<p>Because I know that I need schedules, I have begun to find ways to govern myself. At least once every few months, I try some strategy to keep me productive through every minute of the day.<a href="#fn0418" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> Without fail, these plans fail. However, I’ve gotten better at following the advice of some random blogger somewhere, who said that it’s far far healthier to reframe that. That is, rather than saying that I failed to keep up my tracking activities to the minute, I could instead say that for the week I did track my time, I was more productive. Things can serve you for short periods of time without becoming permanent fixtures.<a href="#fn0419" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>However, there are kinds of schedules that I do find I can keep myself on, at least in general.<a href="#fn0420" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> In general, things which occur monthly or weekly are much easier for me to keep up on. Daily activities that don’t need to be done in a schedule can also be easier to keep up on, which isn’t really relevant here. The fact that I can do things with a weekly schedule is the way that I can kill the birds with a stone.</p>
<p>There is even a third bird that my suggestion will help ricochet to.</p>
<p>Sorry, I have written about 500 words in footnotes for this draft, and I find that I’ve completely lost the thread of this musing. Time to try again (if you didn’t read the footnotes, they’re a time).</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>I’ve mused a few times before<a href="#fn0421" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> about schedules. As I come to another day where none of the prompts that I have feel particularly good, I’m going to jump the gun on 2024’s New Year’s Resolutions and start talking about my schedule. I’d like to start writing one really good essay a week.<a href="#fn0422" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>I think that one way I can get through that is by scheduling other blog posts to be more mundane, and therefore require less energy, with the goal and expectation that I then use the extra time and mental space to write parts of a longer and better thought out musing. So, what are things that I want to keep up on every week?</p>
<p>Maybe I should take a step back and ask what things I want to prioritize in the next year.</p>
<p>Nope, that’s a bad idea because most of what I want to prioritize are habits.</p>
<p>There are seven days each week. If Sundays are reserved for Reflections on the Gospel or Readings generally<a href="#fn0423" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>, and I want to spend Saturdays on a more in depth writing, what do I do with the other five days?</p>
<p>I want to do more composition, so one day a week could be reserved for my progress getting through species counterpoint. Actually, let’s take a moment and decide whether I actually want to keep learning species counterpoint. The choir I’m in has implied that it would be willing<a href="#fn0424" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> to let me compose some music, but I don’t really know if that’s something that fits into my life. Right now writing is really becoming a huge part of it, and I think that I would like that to continue.</p>
<p>One day a week could be reserved for me to reflect on the writing I’ve done over the past week. I think that monthly and daily checkins might be the wrong level for me to be motivated to outwrite on my web novel.</p>
<p>Since I want to make progress on the album, one day a week could be reserved for talking about it. Right now, I need to write and record and all the other parts of songs, so there’s bound to be stuff to talk about re: difficulties, fun parts, etc. That brings us to four.</p>
<p>If I continue doing open mics semi regularly, talking about them could be fun. When I consider that open mics tend to run opposite a DND campaign that I’m in, we get Mondays taken care of. Then again, I don’t want to have to force myself to do those activities or muse about them.</p>
<p>Still, four days a week of musings is better than one. One day a week could be a brief review of everything that I’ve read.<a href="#fn0425" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> That actually sounds really fun, especially because I can also jot down my notes somewhere more cogent. On weeks that I feel like reviewing a book, it can go there, and on other weeks I can just discuss the reading that I’ve been doing.</p>
<p>One day a week devoted to working on my thesis would probably not go amiss. Since I want it to be fairly long, I do need to get a lot of writing done. I do worry about the fact that I would like those to also be edited, and the musing format tends to be more informal than I’d like. Still, I am sure that I could find at least one thing to quickly talk about each week, especially since I want to work on making a lot of my research more approachable to the general person.</p>
<p>(took a break to play some backgammon, time to start musing again)</p>
<p>Right now we have:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sunday: Reflections on Readings</p></li>
<li><p>Saturday: Better Musing</p></li>
<li><p>A Day: What I’ve been Reading</p></li>
<li><p>A Day: Thesis Work (very nominal, can be as vague as needed)</p></li>
<li><p>A Day: Progress on the Album</p></li>
<li><p>A Day: Progress on writing generally</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Oh shoot! I also have flash fiction fridays! That takes up my whole weekend, so then we should probably get rid of one of the seven so that I have time to have one day free? There are absolutely topics I want to discuss that I don’t think deserve a full length essay.<a href="#fn0426" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>so:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sunday: Reflections on Readings</p>
<p>Rationale: I’m obligated to attend Mass on Sunday, it’s the day that I’ve been told I should set aside for the Lord, and it’s a good habit to make me more prayerful.</p></li>
<li><p>Monday: Thesis Work.</p>
<p>Rationale: Starting the week with active productivity will make me better at work generally and should help me prime the week to come.</p></li>
<li><p>Tuesday: Free day.</p>
<p>Rationale: I filled the other six days and I want one day where I’m free to write whatever is on my mind/ generally have a day to discuss what’s going on.</p></li>
<li><p>Wednesday: Progress on the Album.</p>
<p>Rationale: Wednesdays are my freest evenings, for all that I teach a discussion section until 5pm those days. As a result, when I’m not as far along as I want to be, I can use the rest of the night to write or record</p></li>
<li><p>Thursday What I’m reading/ writing.</p>
<p>Rationale: I think that it makes most sense to alternate these or maybe do both each week. Of the things that I want to do, these are the freest, and so I feel like deserve to get crammed together.</p></li>
<li><p>Friday: Flash Fiction Friday.</p>
<p>Rationale: the event is on Fridays, and I think that it will continue to do me good to think about it.</p></li>
<li><p>Saturday: Long form Musing.</p>
<p>Rationale: Saturdays should be days of rest, and that way I have the whole week to look forward to the writing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For all that this feels very ordered on the page, a retrospective note should say that I wrote it in order: Sunday, Monday, Friday, Saturday, Wednesday, Thursday, Tuesday.</p>
<p>1000 words later, let’s try to make this coherent?</p>

<li id="fn0411" role="doc-endnote"><p>I keep wondering what the difference between among and amongst is. I remember seeing part of it is formal and informal or new versus old.

Looking it up, Garner apparently believes that amongst is needlessly pretentious in American English, being as it is, an Archaism. Alack, nigh, and wot are all also in that list, which is kind of funny and interesting. Cambridge, on the other hand, suggests amongst is just the more formal version.

<h1 id="on-practicing-scales"><a href="practicing-scales.html">On Practicing Scales</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 December 26</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>I’ve talked on this blog many times about the fact that I often struggle with finding a topic for my musings. Today I began to look for inspiration in that best of places, my own blog.<a href="#fn051" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I found an old footnote about the fact that I don’t really like the phrase eating your vegetables, and prefer practicing your scales.</p>
<p>There are a variety of reasons for that. Obviously, there’s the fact that I tend to enjoy vegetables,<a href="#fn052" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> which makes the expression not resonate for me. Additionally, there is the fact that<a href="#fn053" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> I tend to hear eating your vegetables in the context of things which are beneficial to a small domain of tasks, while eating vegetables is something which is generally good and helpful for overall life quality. And, most importantly,<a href="#fn054" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> I tend to find that people use the expression not as a way of expressing need, but as a way to emphasize the difference between Amateur and Dilettante.<a href="#fn055" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>What do I mean by that?<a href="#fn056" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>I mean that I’ll be using the words as they initially were meant<a href="#fn057" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>, or for those less comfortable with that, I’ll be using the words based on their Latin roots.<a href="#fn058" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> That is, an Amateur is one who loves a craft, while a Dilettante simply enjoys it<a href="#fn059" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>. What’s the difference?<a href="#fn0510" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Well, what’s the difference between love and enjoyment? Love, to me, at least, has an element of growth. Enjoyment, on the other hand, asks and assumes nothing of that.</p>
<p>To practice scales, then, is to accept the unpleasant parts of a craft because you understand the benefits. As someone<a href="#fn0511" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> says, you don’t get to choose whether you go in the dirt, only what dirt you go in.<a href="#fn0512" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>I think it’s an important distinction, and one that really will be helpful to me as I continue framing my life.<a href="#fn0513" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> What does it mean to practice scales?</p>
<p>On almost every instrument, one of the assignments that an instructor gives fairly early in the pedagogy is practicing scales and variations thereof.<a href="#fn0514" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> Why?<a href="#fn0515" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> Even though almost no song is exclusively a scale,<a href="#fn0516" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> the majority of most music, especially music in the canon<a href="#fn0517" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> is primarily written in a scalar fashion. The reasons for that are ancient and long enduring, but it is generally easier for most people to sing scalar melodies.<a href="#fn0518" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>However, unless you are dedicating yourself to the craft,<a href="#fn0519" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> you almost never need to work on scales. If we move to the kitchen, one of the first tasks that I’ve heard every culinary institute or restaurant requires of its chefs is chopping loads and loads of vegetables perfectly and uniformly. As someone who merely enjoys cooking, I will probably never bother to do that. However, I also accept that the fact that I do not practice julienning or any other technique on countless thousands of carrots does mean that there is a level of reproducibility and refinement that my cooking will never have.</p>
<p>So, as someone who does not believe that it’s necessary to practice scales, I can choose to do so. When I practice scales, it is with the knowledge that, assuming my goal is to improve at the craft, the best use of my time is probably spent working on scales. However, there are many things that I do but do not love doing.<a href="#fn0520" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> Even if I enjoy them, it is not worth the effort of getting better for the sake of getting better.</p>
<p>When I work on embroidery, though, right now I am actively striving to improve. There may be something questionable in the fact that I intrinsically tie love with desire to improve, but I don’t know if I want to unpack that right now.<a href="#fn0521" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> Since I am dedicated to improving, I am willing to take time to simply embroider a specific stitch or test swatch over and over until it’s perfect.</p>
<p>In crochet, however, I don’t really care about getting better. Right now I know that I am good enough at crochet to make anything that I want to make. As a result, I’m not going to spend time, energy, and yarn, working on a specific skill simply to be better at that skill, even if it would be generally helpful to my overall craft.</p>
<p>Woof. This musing got away from me a little. Eh, I think that I got somewhere good, even if it’s only coherent to me.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I embroider today? I plotted out the actual next project I have and then started it.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I play guitar today? Took today off.</p></li>

</ul></li>
<li><p>Reading</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have I made progress on my Currently Reading Shelf? A little bit. I’m not enjoying the book right now, but that could have any number of causes.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I read the book on craft? I did not, for all that I thought about it a lot.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write a sonnet? I think that I’m done with sonnets for the month. I can do them quickly, and right now I want to just spend my time with my family<a href="#fn0522" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? Look at this! It even has some elements of growth.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write ahead on Jeb? At some point I need to start again. If I want to be five chapters ahead by the third, I really need to pick up the pace.</p></li>
<li><p>Letter to friends? Nope! A friend set up a meeting time, though, so that’s good enough.</p></li>
<li><p>Paper? I’ve started thinking again.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Wellness</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How well did I pray? Badly, but maybe better.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I spend my time well? I’ve decided that anything that I do with family counts as time well spent.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? Nope.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I exercise? Kind of! Because we had activities, if no other reason.</p></li>
<li><p>Water? Eh, not really.</p></li>
</ul></li>

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As much as I do trust the book on writing, I want to write my musings as essays only. So, despite the fact that they recommend writing my essays where the first draft is not a full essay, but as pieces, I will not be taking their advice. Of course, I am starting my musing<a href="#fn0523" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> from a much further point than normal. I already know what I want to muse about, and I already even have some concepts ready.</p>
<p>I was struggling to come up with a musing idea today. I read through some old musings that I made, and found inspiration. Today I finally started embroidering again. I thought that could be a good place to start, so I read through my old musings on embroidering.</p>
<p>In the footnote of <a href="embroidery-2.html">my second musing</a>, I mentioned that something good to muse about could be the concept of practicing your scales. Practicing your scales, to me at least, is a better metaphor than eating your vegetables. There are a few reasons for that.</p>
<p>First, I honestly tend to enjoy eating vegetables. The concept of eating your vegetables tends to be something unenjoyable but necessary.</p>
<p>Second, and far more importantly, I tend to think of eating your vegetables as something you do that is undesirable but good for a specific activity. Eating your vegetables is<a href="#fn0524" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> something that you have to do for general life purposes.</p>
<p>So, what does practicing your scales mean?</p>
<p>First, I don’t know that I’ve ever actually met someone who enjoys working on scales.<a href="#fn0525" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> Second<a href="#fn0526" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a>, working on scales is not, strictly speaking, necessary.<a href="#fn0527" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> Scales make music far easier, especially when you take scale not just mean playing the notes of a given key up and down stepwise, but also with some small intervals, like thirds and maybe fourths.<a href="#fn0528" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> The fact that they are not needed but make life far easier and better is really where this metaphor works.</p>
<p>So, at this point in the musing, we can either go for how we can use the metaphors or why scales are helpful. Or, I guess that the initial musing talked about how I’m only now enough of an adult to practice my scales, so I suppose that I could focus there. I think that I want to go with the first.</p>
<p>What does it mean to practice scales in other domains?</p>
<p>What are other domains? I suppose that for many athletes, cardio or strength is the equivalent. If you enjoy running or lifting, though, that metaphor breaks down a little.</p>
<p>Other domains include writing? I suppose that the practice I’m doing typing could count. Let’s talk about that (in the next draft).<a href="#fn0529" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> What else could count? In some regards, the reading about writing that I do is practicing scales.</p>
<p>Oh gosh, there’s a concern now that I could treat the parts of my craft I’m comparing here to practicing scales as something that is less than enjoyable. I assume that this will not be an issue, since I don’t plan on remembering this.<a href="#fn0530" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>Ok so reading about writing, practicing touch typing, arguably even the writing that I’m doing right now.</p>
<p>In music, there’s scales and fingering exercises, obviously.</p>
<p>In cooking, there’s repeating recipes? Practicing cutting? Oh yeah that’s the equivalent. Practicing just cutting to make everything perfect.</p>
<p>Oh hey, that makes me think that practicing scales is what separates masters from amateurs.<a href="#fn0531" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>As the above footnote points out, to be an amateur is historically to do something for love. Where did that shift come from? Oh duh, the word was initially used to refer to the rich gentlemen of England, who pursued a craft out of love, rather than to make a living. When we shift to the fact that America doesn’t really believe in class<a href="#fn0532" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a>, it makes sense that there would be a semantic shift. Dilettante is apparently a similar word.</p>
<p>Anyways, what separates the amateur from the not?</p>
<p>What’s the opposite of an amateur?</p>
<p>Because of how fully the world has shifted to thinking of amateur<a href="#fn0533" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> as non professional, it’s hard to think of the type of person who does the work primarily for the need. Oh wait, my opposite is not one who works for a living, but one who does not truly love a craft.</p>
<p>Dilettante<a href="#fn0534" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> works great for that. It comes from delight, with connotations historically and always as one who does something because it’s fun.</p>
<p>Ok so practicing scales is what separates the Amateur<a href="#fn0535" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> from the Dilettante. Great! That sounds like a good musing idea.<a href="#fn0536" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>So, let’s start with “what does it mean to practice scales?”</p>
<p>Practicing scales is similar to something that other people talk about: eating your vegetables.</p>
<p>Ok so as much as I want to focus on dilettante rather than amateur, I do still want to title the file practicing scales. I also do want to muse about that, for all that it doesn’t take much to do that. I feel like one hundred words is enough to explain it. Let’s try second draft and see what it looks like.</p>

<li id="fn0528" role="doc-endnote"><p>sixths and larger are just good for practicing leaps, which tend to happen very rarely. A common warmup I’ve done on basically every chromatic wind instrument (wind in the sense of blown, not just woodwinds) is to start on the fifth and then play down by half steps (e.g. G, f sharp, g, f, g e, g d sharp... g c g), so that I can practice intonation and leaps at once. Often I’ll go for an octave after that.

<h1 id="christmas-2023"><a href="christmas-2023.html">Christmas 2023</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 December 25</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>This is now <a href="christmas-2018.html">my</a> <a href="christmas-2022.html">third</a> musing on Christmas. As with the other two, I’m publishing it on Christmas Day.<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>My previous musings about Christmas have been fairly short. The first<a href="#fn062" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> was four sentences. Half of those were less than four words a piece.<a href="#fn063" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> The second was a little longer, but focused almost exclusively on the liturgical readings.</p>
<p>Today, I’d like to focus a little on the traditions that my family has kept. As I grow older, I find that I’ve been thinking a lot more about what parts of my life I’d like to keep forever, what parts I wish never happened, and what I think served its purpose and is no longer needed.</p>
<p>Our Christmas mornings tend to start with cinnamon rolls. This past Thanksgiving, my little brother<a href="#fn064" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> and I realized that we both had fond memories of orange rolls as children. We still are not entirely certain which family member we had the rolls for,<a href="#fn065" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> but we do know why we stopped having them. In short, none of the extant adults in my family like them.<a href="#fn066" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> I did not remember that, however, and got orange rolls for the morning after Thanksgiving.<a href="#fn067" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> My little brother and I loved them, and so this year’s Christmas morning breakfast also included orange rolls.<a href="#fn068" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Moving slightly back in the chronology, we get matching pajamas as a family every year. We open them on Christmas Eve, and then we all wear them on Christmas day. A related tradition: the children take a photo with Santa every year. Once we reached an age that it stopped seeming reasonable to go to the Santa in town,<a href="#fn069" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> we started taking them as a family on Christmas morning. We’ve now merged the two traditions, and it’s really fun getting to look back and see the siblings in matching clothes.</p>
<p>We do a gift exchange after the photos<a href="#fn0610" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>, and then we make a quick breakfast and eat it. After that, we play a board game.<a href="#fn0611" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> By that point, we’re all tired of each other<a href="#fn0612" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>, so we tend to be free until dinner. For some reason, I have no memories of what we historically eat for Christmas dinner.</p>
<p>All in all, I love the fact that my family’s Christmas is what it is. I’m sure that at least some portion of my attachment to the traditions comes from the fact that they’re the traditions that we have. If I had grown with others, I am sure that I would have loved them just as much.<a href="#fn0613" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I embroider today? I plotted out the next embroidery project I want to work on. Unfortunately, I did not start on it until 2100, and that is far too late to start embroidering for the day. Maybe tomorrow.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I play guitar today? Just a touch! But I did enjoy the amount that I did.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I practice touch typing today? I made it all the way to Q! It bothers me more than a little that the last letter we get is J, but as soon as I make it through the Q, I’m through all the letters at at least 50 wpm, which means that it becomes time to reset the goal with much higher wpm. Probably closer to 70, since that really is my goal speed. Then again, it isn’t really like I need to be able to type q at 70 wpm, since most of the time I won’t need it. B is the big issue letter today<a href="#fn0614" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>, so at least that’s progress, since C no longer is a struggle for me I guess.</p>
<p>Update a few minutes later, I’ve officially gotten the entire alphabet at 50 words per minute. Now it’s time to up the goal to 75 and see what happens. Ooh cool! It saves my progress, so now I just had to restart with A, and then go to Y. That’s pretty fun. I am wondering whether it might be in my best interest to set the intermediate goal a little lower. Idk.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Reading</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have I made progress on my Currently Reading Shelf? Nope! But that’s ok! I spent the day with my family instead.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I read the book on craft? Shoot! Hopefully tomorrow.</p></li>
<li><p>Have I read the library books? Not even a little. Let’s see if we cannot do more of that next month in particular. I feel like my schedule doesn’t really exist when I’m at home.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write a sonnet? I wrote one yesterday, and I’m going to take today off from writing one, since it’s very late out, and I would rather sleep.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? Another day where I’m not thrilled with the quality, but that’s life, I suppose.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write ahead on Jeb? It’s Christmas, so that’s obviously not happening either.</p></li>
<li><p>Letter to friends? I sent all the Christmas notes, and I had some good conversations with friends.</p></li>
<li><p>Paper? It remains a holy day.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Wellness</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How well did I pray? Not great.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I spend my time well? I think so!</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? No. Sad.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I exercise? Shockingly! A little, if only because there were some activities today.</p></li>
<li><p>Water? I drank water to the point that I no longer wanted it today! I’m very proud of myself.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>This is now <a href="christmas-2018.html">my</a> <a href="christmas-2022.html">third</a> musing on Christmas. As with the other two, I’m publishing it on Christmas Day.<a href="#fn0615" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> Apparently both of my musings on Christmas have been fairly short.</p>
<p>My initial musing, published in the initial iteration of this blog, was four sentences, half of which were under four words. My musing last year, being a combined Christmas and Reflection on Readings, was a little longer, and focused more on the liturgical aspect of the season.</p>
<p>This year, however, I am writing this musing early enough that I have time to actually think,<a href="#fn0616" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> and not on a Sunday.<a href="#fn0617" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> As a result, I find that I have more time to consider what I want to muse about.</p>
<p>So, what do I want to muse about? The book on the craft of writing suggests that it’s best to plan to spend half the time you have allotted to an essay on planning and half on actually writing. I don’t think that will be a part of my life for a while, but let’s try some of what they suggest.</p>
<p>One piece of advice was to do some free association. Christmas to Christmas movies to Scrooge. Christmas, advent, awaiting, Christmas, stockings, family, loved ones.</p>
<p>OK my mind doesn’t do free word association well right now.<a href="#fn0618" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>What are things that I did today?</p>
<p>Texted wishes for a happy Christmas to friends<a href="#fn0619" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>, and had some nice digital conversations with them. I spent time with family, which was lovely as always!<a href="#fn0620" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> In particular, we played games as a family, had some meals together, and did a small gift exchange.</p>
<p>I’ve started writing this musing, which is something. I honestly think that may be literally everything that I’ve done today. Ok so maybe musing about today as a thing isn’t a great idea. My family’s reaction to me saying who all I was texting today makes me think a musing about that might not be welcome either.</p>
<p>That’s really it for today. So, let’s think about what Christmas in general means to me? Let’s see what that sparks. I guess the question is if I want to focus on the cultural or religious connotations that Christmas has for me.<a href="#fn0621" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>Having now made, eaten, and cleaned up from dinner, there’s probably something I can muse about combining my post about family recipes, the fact that we only use red potatoes for mashed potatoes, and the fact that no one on the internet will say they’re meant for that. However, I don’t really know if I can connect that to Christmas, especially today. It might be a good idea to think more about it for future musings about family recipes.</p>
<p>Ok so let’s try to make a coherent draft. I still haven’t figured out what I want to muse about. The writing book says that you should spend a few days on this process, but acknowledges that you may not always have the option to do so.</p>
<p>Christmas. What’s it about? No that feels too trite and over done.</p>
<p>Christmas. Fears that I have related to it? Feels too personal to this blog.</p>
<p>Christmas. Why is it so hot out today? Could be good.</p>
<p>Christmas. Changes?</p>
<p>Hmmm. What can we talk about for changes?</p>
<p>There’s the obvious, that the weather is changing as the climate gets worse. There’s the way that family traditions change. There’s the voice in my head that says this might be the last Christmas we have together.<a href="#fn0622" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> There’s the fact that life hasn’t really returned to a stasis since Covid? Idk let’s see what happens if we just go like that.</p>

<h1 id="reflections-on-todays-gospel"><a href="reflections-on-readings-4-advent-b-23.html">Reflections on Today’s Gospel</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 December 24</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>Today is the Fourth Sunday of Advent. It’s a strange set of readings, especially when we look at the readings that we have had for the past few weeks. The first reading, as expected, is a reading from the Old Testament. Unlike most of the other readings, today’s does not come from one of the explicitly prophetic books. Instead, we have an excerpt<a href="#fn071" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> from the Second Book of Samuel. We follow David, who wants to build the Ark of the Covenant a better dwelling place.</p>
<p>Of course, as Catholics, we know that the Ark was a foreshadowing of Mary, who carried the Christ into the world.<a href="#fn072" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> And so, it’s only fitting that the Gospel today focus on Mary. In particular, we see one thread continuing from the time of David the king to the time of Christ the King: The Almighty’s angels. The Angel Gabriel delivers messages both to David and to Mary. And so, in the final hours before Christmas<a href="#fn073" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, I think it’s good to reflect on what Mary said to the Angel of the Most High, “may it be done unto me according to your word.”<a href="#fn074" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> The Pater Noster may be the perfect form of prayer, but Mary’s Fiat<a href="#fn075" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> is bound to be a close second. David wanted to build a fitting home for the Ark, but did not know what to ask.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I embroider today? I realized that I actually want to learn the stylistic aspects so tried to recharge a device that would let me plot out my embroidery. I charged it, but that’s as far as I got.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I play guitar today? I did! Even jammed with my brother for a little bit<a href="#fn076" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Did I practice touch typing today? I made it through B! Have to repeat P again tomorrow, but that’s a task for future me.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Reading</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have I made progress on my Currently Reading Shelf? I finished the currently reading book from the library, now I just need to finish the rest of the books that I’m reading.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I read the book on craft? I read! Only about twenty pages. If I want to finish the book by the end of the month<a href="#fn077" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>, I need to read a little more quickly. It’s really fascinating how much I feel like I learn in every word. I’m also glad to know that the authors agree with me that there are no perfect synonyms.</p></li>
<li><p>Have I read the library books? Oh gosh, there’s no chance at all that I finish the books in time. If I start reading just far too much, it would be possible for me to make it through, but it would mean that I kind of cannot do anything else.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write a sonnet? I feel bad about the amount of time that I’ve taken off from this goal. Let’s go write one right now.<a href="#fn078" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Did I revise a sonnet? Revision no longer feels needed. I’m going to delete it starting tomorrow.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? I’m not thrilled with this musing, but I don’t have the mental space to keep trying.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write ahead on Jeb? Sunday which is obviously a day off.</p></li>
<li><p>Letter to friends? I wrote out the Christmas notes that I want to send.</p></li>
<li><p>Paper? It’s a holiday.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Wellness</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How well did I pray? I went to two Masses, which means that there was at least a little bit of prayer.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I spend my time well? Pretty well! I spent it with family, which is really nice.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? I am regretting the fact that I don’t, and I need to find a way to fit it into my life from now on.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I exercise? See the prior item.</p></li>
<li><p>Water? I drank more water, if only because my voice kept breaking at my first mass.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>It’s the fourth Sunday of Advent, and it almost feels like Christmas.<a href="#fn079" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Today’s readings were pretty standard “be ready for Christmas” readings. The first reading comes from the Second book of Samuel, where we see David trying to pay homage to his Lord. He looks around, realizing that he lives in a beautiful home, while the Lord is being kept in a tent. The prophet of the day<a href="#fn0710" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> assures him that the Lord will appreciate any efforts that Daniel puts forth.</p>
<p>The Lord, however, comes to Nathan in a dream,<a href="#fn0711" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> and tells him to tell Daniel not to build a temple. More than that, though, the Lord says that he will establish an eternal kingdom from David’s descendants. As Catholics, we know what that kingdom is, and who the heir is. The Gospel, of course, makes that explicit.</p>
<p>The angel<a href="#fn0712" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Gabriel<a href="#fn0713" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> comes to Mary. Importantly, he is the same angel who came to Daniel to interpret his visions. It’s something that very rarely comes up in homilies that I’ve heard, probably for some good reason.</p>
<p>Of course, one reason could very easily just be that the Ave Maria<a href="#fn0714" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> is allegedly a very unpopular prayer among Protestants.<a href="#fn0715" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> The fact that the opening line comes directly from an angel<a href="#fn0716" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> of the Lord should, in theory, help assuage concerns about the prayer. Then again, I don’t know if anyone attending Mass on the Fourth Sunday of Advent<a href="#fn0717" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> needs to be convinced that Mary is a good and holy person, worthy of admiration.<a href="#fn0718" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Advent in general, as the priest today reminded us, is a season focused on Mary. It feels a little strange to me that we only really care about the last month of Mary’s pregnancy, but I suppose that otherwise we’d have to start Advent as soon as Easter ended.<a href="#fn0719" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> I’m sure there’s something to think about in the fact that we only really talk about Christ as a newborn child and as a thirty three year old. It is a little strange to think that, were I Christ, nothing that I’ve really done with my life so far would have been recorded.</p>
<p>Post writing note: I’m not really happy with the musing right now, for all that I don’t really know what else there is to reflect on in the readings. Maybe I should come back to this in a little bit?</p>

<h1 id="on-family-recipes"><a href="family-recipes.html">On Family Recipes</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 December 23</p>
<h1 id="draft-3-december-23">Draft 3: December 23</h1>
<p>Holidays are a time to remember. For many, it is a time when the entire family shows up in the same space to share a meal and fellowship. Traditions form as people bond to a specific food or ritual. As older members die and newer people join the family, traditions mutate and change.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, traditions last until they are questioned. I’m reminded of one from my own family, where we used to trim the ends off of each roast before cooking. When we finally reconstructed the narrative, it turned out that the only roasting pan one of the family owned was too small for the roasts. Even as we got larger pans, however, we continued trimming the roast.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I was reminded of this as I prepared the only family recipe I get from my mother’s half of the family. Now, earlier drafts<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> focused far more on the specific dish. I think that it’s worth taking a step back and thinking more about what family recipes tell us in general.</p>
<p>Until just a few years ago, for instance, I thought that we had a family recipe for green bean casserole. In some regards we do. We prepare the meal the same way, and it’s a recipe we use for every important meal.<a href="#fn082" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> However, it turns out that the recipe we follow comes directly from the French’s Fried Onion box.</p>
<p>I have read a number of so called family recipes that adapt<a href="#fn083" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> from a recipe book that someone’s mother or grandmother or aunt read. In the times before the internet, it was difficult to source information. If someone brought a dish you liked, asking them for a recipe would not necessarily come with the recipe’s provenance.</p>
<p>Honestly, my mind is blank today, and I do not know what else I could say. I’m sure that there’s more I could muse on, but I don’t know what.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I embroider today? I still haven’t figured out who I’d give the gift to, though I do like the last design I made. It could be fun to just make more letters.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I play guitar today? Just for a moment! It was fun, and I’m starting to enjoy E Major as a chord, for all that I still dislike B Major.<a href="#fn084" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Did I practice touch typing today? I did! I made it through P and am now ready to start on B tomorrow. I was once again stopped on c for a bit, which isn’t fantastic, but it is what it is.</p></li>

<li><p>Have I made progress on my Currently Reading Shelf? One of my library books is due soon, so I’m working to finish it tonish.</p></li>

<li><p>Did I write ahead on Jeb? Today is one of the days off.</p></li>

<p>Holidays are a time of memories. For many households in modern America, holidays are the one time a year that the entire intergenerational family is under one roof. Flavors and specific preparations can be handed down from the people with the greatest attachment to them. As the oldest members of the family die and younger family members are born, recipes and meal plans change. Sometimes, things continue to be done the same way, simply because there is no need to question the way things are always done.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, someone new<a href="#fn085" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> will ask what the point is of some tradition. I’m reminded of one from my own family, where we used to trim the ends off of each roast before cooking. When we finally reconstructed the narrative, it turned out that the only roasting pan one of the family owned was too small for the roasts. Even as we got larger pans, however, we continued trimming the roast.</p>
<p>In my own household, we have very little of this generational memory. In part, it comes from the fact that many members of my family in recent generations have disowned or been disowned by their relatives.<a href="#fn086" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h1 id="draft-1-december-22">Draft 1: December 22</h1>
<p>Today I made one of<a href="#fn087" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> the family recipes I’ve inherited. We’ve always called it halishki<a href="#fn088" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>: a dish of dropped egg noodles in a chicken and cream sauce. When you google the word, I mostly find a Polish word for a dish with noodles and cabbage in a pork based sauce. There’s more or less nothing in common with my family recipe and that.</p>
<p>However, this presupposes that my family recipe is Polish. We really don’t know where most of my family came from, especially this part of the family. I’ve always been told it was somewhere Slavic, but that really does not narrow it down too much. If we start searching for Polish drop noodles, we find kluski. Wikipedia for kluski takes us to a similar dish in other portions of Eastern Europe, halusky<a href="#fn089" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>. Halusky is small dropped egg noodles, which does accurately describe the dish that I make, for all that it is also described as typically being served with cabbage.</p>
<p>However, I know that many members of my family have been unable to eat cabbage. That could explain the lack of cabbage in the family recipe. At this point, though, I was excited to learn more.</p>
<p>I got the last name<a href="#fn0810" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> of the person we initially got the recipe from.<a href="#fn0811" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> The last name does come from the areas listed in the second Wikipedia article, which is pretty cool. One of the two variant spellings is allegedly Jewish in origin, which is interesting. I’m sure that there’s a fascinating history there that is now lost to the mists of time.</p>
<p>So, what is the family recipe? As far as I can tell, the recipe is more or less just chicken and dumplings in a cream sauce. I don’t see many recipes for chicken and dumplings that call for cream sauce.</p>
<p>How do I make it, though? I think that every time that I have been personally a part of making it<a href="#fn0812" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>, I’ve followed a slightly different recipe. However, this time through I think will be my recipe going forwards.</p>
<p>I started by melting some butter in a large stock pot and then browning some chicken.<a href="#fn0813" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> The goal was really just getting a bit of color on the meat and a touch of fond on the pan. Once the chicken was browned, we put some butter in the pot and then some white onion. Once the onion looked soft, I added in the chicken stock and let it come to a boil.</p>
<p>We made a very simple dumpling dough<a href="#fn0814" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> out of egg, flour, salt, and pepper.<a href="#fn0815" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> We then spoon some portions of the dough<a href="#fn0816" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> into the boiling stock, chop some celery and add it in, and add the chicken<a href="#fn0817" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> back. From there, I let it simmer covered fora bout an hour, and then uncovered it to let the stock reduce a fair amount. Just before serving, we taste the broth for seasoning, and then add cream to taste and texture.</p>
<p>This time around, we made a huge recipe of it, which should be really nice for leftovers. Historically, it’s tasted far better the next day, as all of the flavors have had time to meld together.</p>
<p>Post Script:</p>
<p>As I look at the past six hundred words, I realize that I want to focus more on the family recipe aspect than the specific recipe we followed. Let’s see how that goes, moving from the specific case to more of a general one?<a href="#fn0818" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<h1 id="flash-fiction-friday"><a href="flash-fiction-232.html">Flash Fiction Friday</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 December 22</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Another Friday, which means it’s time to try to answer another prompt. The prompt this week is among any option. I had no idea how to respond to this prompt, and reading the description didn’t make the prompt any more sensible. However, it did give me some ideas.</p>
<p>The prompt implies a choice. If we keep that in mind, then the prompt shifts to choosing between any option. What could be a good response for that prompt?</p>
<p>My mind is falling immediately to love, but I have to wonder how much of that is just me choosing a new creative rut. I think that the last few times that I’ve written a FFF, it’s been about romance of some sort. What else could we set as a number of choices?</p>
<p>I mean basically anything can be a set of choices, which makes this prompt feel almost too broad. I guess that more or less any writing I produce will be good for the prompt. A part of me really doesn’t like that, though, because part of my ideal for prompts is that it constrains my writing.</p>
<p>So, where else does my mind immediately go?</p>
<p>Given that we did a family recipe for dinner<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, I’m finding that I’m thinking about choosing foods. As the new Percy Jackson television series<a href="#fn092" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> is coming out, there’s choices about media we consume, hero’s choices, and the like. Since we play board games as a family, the idea of what game to play comes up a lot.</p>
<p>The hero’s choices feel like something that I want to interact with. What do heroes do? Or, rather, what terrible choice could a hero be forced into?<a href="#fn093" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>I’m still circling around the idea of romance, which may be something that I could do?</p>
<p>So, we have a hero<a href="#fn094" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> who needs to make a choice. Maybe there’s something to say about like deciding between the person you love and the work you need to do? Alright, how can we frame it in a way that hasn’t been done to death a million times?</p>
<p>Or, just as much in the choice, how do we do what we want to do with our full self, ignoring all the self doubt and negative self talk?</p>
<p>A hero has a choice. How explicit do I need to make that? I think that at this point I really need to focus on the writing, which means I need to stop writing about writing and start actually writing.<a href="#fn095" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Actually, wait, let’s think about the normal questions we have. Do I want to have first or third person? I don’t really know. I think that we should write it and see what happens.</p>
<p>Ok so about five hundred words of writing later, I find that I got too far from the prompt. I more or less wrote a retrospective, ten years later. I think that I focused too much on the retrospective, rather than the actual set of choices. Maybe I could do something looking forwards instead?</p>
<p>Ooh, I actually really like the FFF I wrote. Let’s see if there’s anything I can do to spice it up for take three, but if not, I am actually going to be ok with it. I assume that I’ll see something that I want to change, but you never know until you try.</p>
<p>Ooh, wow, the revision is way stronger, I think. I more or less replaced every word, which is kind of funny when you think about it. The scene played out more or less the same, though, which is interesting. I do still feel like I rushed the ending, which is more and more something I realize I struggle with. The ending of a story always seems to come too quickly, and I don’t quite know how to wrap it<a href="#fn096" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> up satisfyingly.</p>
<p>All this to say, good night.</p>

<li><p>Did I embroider today? I need to find the embroidery, and more importantly, I need to find time for the embroidery. Picking a project would probably help too. There has to be someone I can give a small thing to, and I can just make something for one of them.</p></li>
