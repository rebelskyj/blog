<p>First Published: 2023 November 26</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Wow! The end of another liturgical year. Despite the fact that the Church more or less created the calendar we use<a href="#fn001" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and absolutely created the liturgical calendar we use, the two do not line up. There is probably some legitimate reason for that. Off the top of my head, the fact that Christmas is not on January 1st, despite arguably being the most important winter day in the Modern Church<a href="#fn002" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, is already enough of a reason to know that the two would diverge. It does go further, though. The modern liturgical calendar begins with Advent, which begins on the first Sunday of November.<a href="#fn003" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>I can probably think of some benefits of doing it this way. One obvious one is that it gives us, at minimum, two days a year that we can call the first of the year. For all that each day is special and perfect in its own way, there’s something intrinsically human about the desire to treat continuity as discrete. Hearing that it’s the end of the year spurs us to consider the next year and to think about how we might change for the better.<a href="#fn004" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Regardless of how important the fact that each year has ended in a new beginning, and will continue to do so until time itself ends, the fact that a year ends is equally important. It reminds us of other endings, most pressing of which is the ending of our life.</p>
<p>The Feast of Christ the King is the last Sunday of the Liturgical Year. Obviously,<a href="#fn005" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> it concerns the end of time and the end of our own lives. It contains some readings that I’ve always struggled with, though differently as I’ve grown older.<a href="#fn006" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>The first reading comes from Ezekiel. In it, we are told that we will be separated into rams and goats. Of course, I know that this does not mean that we are predestined, as is a common enough heresy in the modern age. The fact remains, though, that we will be judged. We are reminded constantly that only in accepting our own limitations and weaknesses can we truly be strong. The reading emphasizes this, saying: “The lost I will seek out, the strayed I will bring back, the injured I will bind up, the sick I will heal, but the sleek and the strong I will destroy, shepherding them rightly.”<a href="#fn007" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The second reading comes, as they tend to, from Paul. Here we are reminded that all will be raised on the last day, beginning with Christ. For all that it’s very easy and settled theology now, I’m more and more appreciating the fact that he makes incredibly bold and outlandish claims by the standards of how the world is otherwise known to work.</p>
<p>Finally, we get to the Gospel. This Gospel passage is quite possibly the easiest passage to understand what we are called to do, for all that it is also one of the hardest to accomplish. In no uncertain terms, we are told that every time we see someone hungry, thirsty, a stranger, ill, or naked<a href="#fn008" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> we see Christ. We can either choose to ignore Him, or we can choose to help Him.</p>
<p>Of course, there is clearly more to the Gospel today than just that message. If there wasn’t, then there would be no way that the Church could justify letting the hungry starve, the prisoner live neglected, the ill die on the streets, or immigrants be torn from their families. Where we are able to draw the distinction, I do not know.</p>
<p>However, as I write today’s musing, I am in my heated home, wearing warm clothes and a soft blanket. I know that there are far too many people right now who are not inside, instead huddling for warmth in the bitter winter air. Knowing that each of them is as Christ to me makes me feel like I need to do more. When I look at what’s happening in the world right now, it seems as though no one has heard this Gospel.</p>
<p>A common objection to giving money to the poor is that they might waste it on something frivolous. As a person who believes very strongly in medicine, the idea that someone with a mental illness might self medicate with alcohol doesn’t really bother me. After all, I have plenty of friends who use different substances to self medicate, and I don’t judge them for it. Why would I judge someone living an objectively harder life?</p>
<p>I’m late enough in writing this musing that I don’t really have the energy to see what the great thinkers of the Church have said about this passage, but I would be curious. Maybe I’ll look another day.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write 1700 words for NaNoWriMo? It’s far too late for me to start, but start I must. Yesterday I was in a similar boat, which is why the musing didn’t come out.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb? I said I wasn’t going to work on it on Sundays, and so I shan’t.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? I think this counts, for all that I chose actively not to yesterday.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? Nope! I’m going lifting early tomorrow morning, though, so maybe that will count.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing better at prayer than a rushed and thoughtless rosary? I’ll try to do a rosary tonight, but very well may fall asleep during it.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing a good job writing letters to friends? I met with friends yesterday and called a friend for like 2 hours today. Even though it’s not a letter, it serves much of the same purpose, which is staying in touch with the people I care about and love. I also got to see some other friends during catechesis tonight, which is always nice.</p></li>
</ul>

<li id="fn001" role="doc-endnote"><p>it isn’t the Gregorian Calendar for no reason. One of the Popes Gregory (should it be Pope Gregories? I never quite know what to do with anglicized titles) created it, or at least mandated its usage. It happened after 1050, which we know because the Orthodox Church doesn’t recognize it (honestly, the fact that I can use random facts to start dating things relative to each other is kind of fun)<a href="#fn00ref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn002" role="doc-endnote"><p>ok, so pre Vatican 2, the Solemnity of Mary, Mother of G-d (January 1st) was celebrated as the Feast of the Circumcision (which I have always loved as a title, for all that it icks a lot of modern listeners out (for good reason)), and that was (as best as I understand Second Temple practice) the day that Christ would have been officially named and brought into the Church. It isn’t seen that way anymore, and that is probably not a fight the Vatican wanted to start<a href="#fn00ref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn003" role="doc-endnote"><p>I’m sure there’s edge cases, because there always are with simple rules. However, the edge cases were already dealt with, because we can, with total certainty, predict what day will occur when arbitrarily far into the future. There’s probably something to add about a post I saw recently talking about how modern society, having now given up belief in the Almighty, is almost required to fall into nihilism. Having just now watched a video from a science channel I really like exactly on how the universe will be mostly dead in a fraction of a fraction of the time that it will take to totally die, I can’t say that I have any real argument against that logic. I want to think about it later, but I’m not sure that now is the perfect time.<a href="#fn00ref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn004" role="doc-endnote"><p>Or at least it does for me. The fact that New Year’s Resolutions are a whole thing implies that it’s at least a strong cultural cue, even if it’s not innate<a href="#fn00ref4" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn006" role="doc-endnote"><p>the fact that I feel like most weeks I start the reflection with a comment similar to this about struggling probably implies something. Whether it’s dissatisfaction with the way the world is, lack of depth of understanding, or disagreement with the Church, I haven’t quite figured out. As it is, I think it’s good for me not to be complacent or comfortable. Growth only happens when you’re neither<a href="#fn00ref6" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<h1 id="flash-fiction-friday"><a href="flash-fiction-228.html">Flash Fiction Friday</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 November 24</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Prereading note: this is being written as a way to generate my fiction for the week. As a result, the first draft (potentially the only draft I post) will be very rambly and disjointed. I will pick up and discard ideas like small pebbles or shells on a wave-swept beach, sifting to find the one that speaks to me.</p>
<p>This is my third week in a row musing about what I want to write for Flash Fiction Friday.<a href="#fn011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> This week’s theme is “A form of distraction.”</p>
<p>Alright, let’s start iterating.</p>
<p>Form of distraction could mean kind of distraction. Form can also be like the shape of an object, such as form over function. What shape does distraction take?</p>
<p>Ok that’s maybe too far into the weeds, but we’ll put a pin in that and maybe come back.</p>
<p>What do I want to do with a form of distraction?</p>
<p>The obvious meaning<a href="#fn012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> is something we do to redirect our attention away from something we don’t want to deal with. Form here modifies distraction in the sense of a shape that distraction can be forced into.</p>
<p>If we instead make distraction the agent, and we the object<a href="#fn013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, we end up with a form of distraction being a way that distraction takes over us.</p>
<p>I haven’t been writing as much these past few days as I would normally like, so I suppose that it’s only natural that my mind goes to writing as the actual center of this story. A form of distraction here could refer to the ways that my attention are pulled from the writing and craft I’ve been dedicated to. Ok I also want to try using the writing advice that I read about recently. Since I don’t want to have to keep going to the <a href="writing-7.html">musing about it</a> and searching through the rambled prose, the rules are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>No think verbs</p></li>
<li><p>No remembering, only flashbacks</p></li>
<li><p>Characters do not belong alone.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If I stick to those three rules, there’s also an implication that I’m in either first person or third person omniscient, since third limited, in my experience, at least, explicitly calls out the thoughts that a character has. Maybe that’s just because the writing I read is bad according to this method, but I don’t think so.<a href="#fn014" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Ok so I think that I want to have something about the form of distraction in writing. I need to have characters, plural, but I don’t know if I really want that. The two desires are clashing. I’m going to take a minute<a href="#fn015" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> and try to form the fiction, seeing what I produce.</p>
<p>Quick note: even before starting to write, i realize that I don’t really want dialogue in this fiction. I write a lot of fiction in everything else that I do, and I think that this site being a place where I minimize dialogue in fiction might be a good idea for me. Maybe not. Ultimately, though, I’m writing this for fun, and it’s completely uncoupled from all the other writing I do, even more than the rest of it is fairly atomized. I’m going to write the first draft as free association and see what comes out.</p>
<p>Two lines in, I’m realizing that I want this to be poetry? I think that there could be something fun with a mixture between poetry and prose. Maybe the first half is poetry<a href="#fn016" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> and then it shifts to prose, reflecting a distraction at a meta level. Is that too edgy for the sake of being different? Maybe! Bu we’ll get to find out, and that’s really the nature of doing short writing. At worst, it doesn’t work and I spent a few minutes doing some writing that didn’t end up working how I thought it might.</p>
<p>Ok, so I don’t really hate what I’ve written. I think that it’s a really strong start, for all that I ended where I think that I want the actual story to start. I guess the question is how blatant I want to be. The writer I cite for writing advice says that starting with the declarative kills the suspense of the other writing. I think that I’ll try leaving the reveal to the end, for all that I know that I’ll need to put the reveal somewhere that makes it better. What I’ve drafted so far, though, is probably good enough for me to start working on the other two and a half writing assignments I have for the day.<a href="#fn017" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Having now finished one of the writing assignments,<a href="#fn018" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> it is now time, I suppose to try revising the FFF. Honestly, though, given that I’m spending time with my family, I don’t know what my motivation level really is. We’re all doing something else while watching a movie,. Then again, I should keep writing, if only because I want to increase my word count for the day. Maybe I’ll try my second assignment for the day.<a href="#fn019" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Well, I think that I honestly am pretty happy with the way this latest draft came out. I’m not sure if I quite want to post it, if only because I feel like there’s merit in writing things solely for my own sake. Now, I suppose, the question is whether I want to rewrite this draft or start writing the final thing I have to write today.</p>
<p>Let’s make a quick pro contra for each. Pros of redrafting this: it’s easy, and I think that it could be fun to reflect about what I wrote in a slightly more coherent manner. Cons of redrafting this: redrafting is really just code for rewriting wholesale, and I don’t know if I really want to do that. Pros of writing Jeb: I get further ahead of the writing that I give to my readers, and I have less stress about doing it in the future. Cons of writing Jeb: I have to figure out where I want the plot<a href="#fn0110" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> to go.</p>
<p>I think that it might be worth, if nothing else, trying to figure out where I want to take the book in the next few chapters. For all that it feels like I kind of have too many words to fill, the number of chapters I have left to tell my story is rapidly shrinking.</p>
<p>Honestly, drafting the book did a lot to help me start to feel ready for writing. I only got halfway through plotting the rest of this book, but I realized that there’s actually a very limited number of things that I need<a href="#fn0111" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> to have happen in the rest of this arc, but I started working backwards. Unfortunately, that means that I still have the rest of the intermediate content to do, including the chapters I need to write right now.<a href="#fn0112" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Anyways, good job with writing today me.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write 1700 words for NaNoWriMo? I did write the content. It’s weird for me to realize that I really only have six days to finish the book. I’m beginning to understand why so many authors put all the action in the last five to ten percent of the novel.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb? I did not, but I did start to plot it out, which is probably better for me in the mid to long term. A family member just caught up on it, though, which is pretty exciting!</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? Wow look at this completely incomprehensible post. It’s still a post though.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? I have been so lazy today. In fairness, I think that the day after a major holiday is almost always a lazy day for my family. It’s nice that we go from active rest, where we do things to make us all feel special, to passive rest, where we just spend time with each other.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing better at prayer than a rushed and thoughtless rosary? Despite the rosy description above, no.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing a good job writing letters to friends? I am not. I’m meeting with friends tomorrow, though, which is a similar vibe.</p></li>

<h1 id="thanksgiving-ahome"><a href="thanksgiving-2023.html">Thanksgiving Ahome</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 November 23</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>I often feel like even when I reflect on a day, the hours pass by in a blur and I have no clue what I’ve done with any of them. I don’t really want that to be the case, especially today. So, as much as possible, I’m planning to treat today as a “day in the life” log.</p>
<p>Let’s start where my morning started. At seven am, my alarms went off. I groaned and kept my eyes closed for a few minutes, too tired to stand up. By the time I managed to remind myself that I was about to go make bagels, an activity I’m excited for, it was closer to seven fifteen.</p>
<p>Downstairs, I found that the bagel dough had risen a lot overnight. It was an incredibly soft and supple dough, which I was grateful for. I felt called to make larger bagels than we have in the past.</p>
<p>I suppose I should explain. My family has a tradition that’s around 8 years old now of making bagels on Thanksgiving morning. If I remember correctly, it began because I was a little sad that my family didn’t really have any fun traditions, and we were also planning to bring a bunch of friends over for Thanksgiving. I also was in a trend of baking bread at that point, and I wanted some way to feel connected to my grandmother. The combination of all of those meant that I thought it could be really fun to make bagels on Thanksgiving morning.</p>
<p>The book we first made the bagels out of said that a single recipe would make two dozen.<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> However, bagels have clearly grown much larger since the book was written, because each of the two dozen bagels was far, far smaller than what I could get at any bagel store. This year, since I did not measure anything, I decided to make bagels that felt closer in size to what I’m familiar with in the rest of my life.</p>
<p>Somehow, this meant that instead of the 30 or so bagels I expected to make, I had 18. That did mean that the boiling and baking went much more quickly, because my family’s oven can easily hold two trays of bagels. The pot was barely too small for six of the bagels at the size I made them, but it worked out fine.</p>
<p>After shaping and boiling,<a href="#fn022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, my father came down. We chatted as I put the bagels into the oven, and we cleaned up from the mess.<a href="#fn023" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> As the bagel finished, we threw a butter braid into the oven, because we all wanted something sweet in addition to bagels.</p>
<p>My mother came down, and we chatted for a bit over coffee and bagels. I delivered a few to a friend of the family, which is another long running part of the tradition. Since the first year we’ve made thanksgiving bagels, we’ve also delivered them to people around the community. In years where we made a few hundred, we gave out far more. Nowadays, the list of deliveries is far shorter, which is a relief.</p>
<p>Coming home, I helped arrange the table and then chatted with my family. At around ten fifteen, I started thinking about writing. I did a few typing exercises, since I would like to be faster at typing.<a href="#fn024" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> I planned out the work I want to do today.<a href="#fn025" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> I know for certain that writing my to do list on paper is more effective for me, if only because I tend to ramble and journal around my to do list when I do it virtually. However, the journalling is a nice way to reflect on my thoughts, and it’s far less coherent than I ever want to put out into the world, so it is what it is.</p>
<p>At that point, it was time for me to start writing this blog. I sign off for now at twenty to eleven, because the rest of the family is up and about and we’re going to start chatting and planning the cooking for the day. We’re more or less unscheduled until 1300, at which point I’ll need to spatchcock turkeys and start cooking This year, we’re shooting for a 5 pm eat time.</p>
<p>Well, I’m signing back on at 2100 or so. I chatted with my family, which was fun, and ended up spatchcocking the turkeys at close to half twelve. Due to some confusion with spices<a href="#fn026" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>, it took a while to get them ready to bake Since my hands were covered in turkey juice and, quite frankly, turkey, I did not weigh in. Given that we were still well ahead of time, I didn’t worry about it.</p>
<p>The internet assured us that it should take about eighty minutes to cook the turkey. We didn’t believe that, and assumed two to two and a half hours. However, as it turned out, we only needed ninety minutes, if only that. I have strong memories of this being true in past years as well, at least since we’ve started spatchcocking. However, despite the fact that the turkey is fairly overcooked, by traditional standards, at least, the breast meat remains juicy.<a href="#fn027" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>While the turkey started to cook, we quickly browned the giblets, neck, and backbones.<a href="#fn028" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Once they had a little bit of color, we added them to a pot of chicken stock we’d made<a href="#fn029" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> and started simmering the two together. The stock ended up getting used for stuffing<a href="#fn0210" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> and gravy.</p>
<p>After that, we started making cranberry sauce and other such dishes. We finished everything about an hour ahead of schedule, at which point we did some cleanup and had dinner. After dinner, we finished cleaning, hung out for a while, and had dessert. At some point during the day, someone came to visit.</p>
<p>I’m sure other events happened throughout the night, but I cannot remember them. Right now, part of the family has gone to bed, and the rest of us are all watching a dumb Christmas movie.<a href="#fn0211" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> That feels like as good of a place to sign this off as any!</p>
<p>Also, I found out just now that I’ve never posted about bagels.<a href="#fn0212" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb? No. It’s thanksgiving, maybe I’ll do some writing tomorrow, once the day kind of nominally calms down. We’ll see.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? Again! A blog, that’s nice. It was fun</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? I cooked all day, which was pretty exhausting. Exhausting may be the wrong term. It was tiring, as a day well spent often is.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing better at prayer than a rushed and thoughtless rosary? Nope!</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing a good job writing letters to friends? Still no.</p></li>

<p>First Published: 2023 November 23</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-22-nov">Draft 1 (22 Nov)</h1>
<p>I’m writing this post tonight, but I know that I won’t get around to posting it until the morning. On the bright side, that means that I can write a second draft of it. Today, for the first time since starting the family tradition of Thanksgiving bagels, I made the dough before the morning of. I don’t know if that will end up being a good idea, but I’m glad that I no longer have to start waking up at 3 in the morning to begin all the prep work for the morning, especially since Thanksgiving is always a long day.</p>
<p>This year’s attempt at bagels included potato starch, bread flour, and vital gluten, which made for a very springy dough. I’m excited to see what it becomes.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write 1700 words for NaNoWriMo? Started too late but did it.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb? I might start slowing down Jeb writing, because my mind is blank.</p></li>

<h1 id="something-im-calling-carbonara-recipe"><a href="carbonara-recipe.html">Something I’m Calling Carbonara Recipe</a></h1>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>I’ve mused a few times in the past few days that, although I write a post a day and averaged out, come up with about a post a day, I almost never have a single idea in a day. Unfortunately, on days that I do not have any ideas, I also tend to forget the ideas that I’ve come up with on previous days</p>
<p>I had been considering writing about music, specifically writing music, but couldn’t find a post with that exact title. Searching through early posts on my blog, I remembered that one series I had was recipes I wanted to be able to remember, reference, and rely on in the future.<a href="#fn041" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Although most of my food exploration has been slowed in the past few months,<a href="#fn042" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> I have at least one recipe that was a mainstay for me for a few weeks.</p>
<p>There are some important contexts to the story of the dish I’m going to describe. First, although I’m going to call it carbonara<a href="#fn043" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, I’ve seen a lot of people on the internet get very mad at calling anything that isn’t exactly what their grandmother<a href="#fn044" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> made carbonara. This is not, in any meaningful sense, a traditional carbonara recipe. However, of the pasta sauces I know names for, carbonara is the closest to describing what I cook.</p>
<p>The recipe requires the following ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Olive Oil</p></li>
<li><p>Pasta, I recommend spaghetti that you know releases a lot of starch<a href="#fn045" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Lemon</p></li>
<li><p>Salt</p></li>
<li><p>Egg</p></li>
<li><p>Black Pepper<a href="#fn046" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Parmesan cheese or whatever local variation you prefer.<a href="#fn047" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Optional: mushroom</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The astute among you may notice that there are no specific ingredient amounts here. That is for a very basic reason: I only believe in measurements by the heart these days.</p>
<p>That being said, there are some constants in most iterations of the recipe. I almost always use a single, whole lemon. I tend to use two or three whole large eggs.<a href="#fn048" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Directions for cooking:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Put water and what seems like an appropriate amount of salt into the pot you plan to cook in.<a href="#fn049" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>While the water starts heating, measure out the amount of pasta you want.<a href="#fn0410" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>If using mushrooms, chop them to desired thickness at this point<a href="#fn0411" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Once water is boiling, put pasta in water.</p></li>
<li><p>At this point, we are now on a timer, which is great and nice. Grate the zest of one lemon into a bowl, along with two or three eggs,<a href="#fn0412" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> and as much cheese as it takes to make the mixture into something which resembles a thick paste.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s a well known fact that the two biggest issues that carbonara can face are a broken sauce and a sauce where the eggs have scrambled. To prevent both of these, I recommend vigorously stirring the beaten egg mixture as you stream in what seems like slightly too much of the pasta water, before draining the rest of the pasta.</p></li>
<li><p>If using mushrooms, put in about twice as much oil as you feel like you should use and cook the mushrooms until at your desired level of doneness.<a href="#fn0413" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>At this point, turn off heat on the stove and add the pasta to the oil and mushroom.</p></li>
<li><p>While stirring vigorously, slowly pour in the sauce. If you have done all the steps correctly, it will thicken as the water evaporates and the egg proteins set, but will not grow clumpy. At this point, squeeze either half or all of the lemon into the pot, again depending on how much pasta there is and how acidic you want it to be.</p></li>
<li><p>Serve immediately and eat before the sauce congeals.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Now, there’s a very valid argument to be made that this is not carbonara in any real sense. There’s no pork of any kind, at a bare minimum. Arguably, calling the sauce you make here mayonnaise is not too far off base, since it’s primarily an emulsion of oil and egg.</p>
<p>Taste wise, however, I have no complaints. The lemon zest and juice make what would otherwise be an incredibly heavy meal into something almost refreshing.</p>
<p>Oh, I realize I forgot to discuss the reasons that I started making this dish. Chief among them is the fact that I started keeping lemons in my home. The curious among my readers might ask why I started keeping lemons in my home.<a href="#fn0414" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> The long and short of it is that I had a friend who seemed appalled that I used lemon juice for all of my cooking needs. He argued that fresh lemons are just objectively better in every regard.</p>
<p>Truthfully, I cannot say that I disagree with that take, having now started to use them. Other than that, the main consideration was that I really just wanted pasta al burro<a href="#fn0415" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> every night for dinner, but knew that wasn’t healthy for me. This still scratched the itch, and had the benefit of a number of other macro and micro nutrients. However, I stopped eating as many lemons, and also wanted to eat more different foods, so I haven’t made this dish as much recently. Maybe I’ll start doing so again. We’ll see, I suppose.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write 1700 words for NaNoWriMo? I did. It was a slog and a half, but I did it.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb? I did not, but I’m too tired from teaching my first university level class and driving home. Tomorrow I have less on my to do list, and so I’ll hopefully have more mental space to do the writing.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? Woo! Look at this blog post.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? Still no.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing better at prayer than a rushed and thoughtless rosary? My rosary last night wasn’t too rushed, but that’s about all the prayer I did.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing a good job writing letters to friends? I brought the letters home with me, so I can at least hopefully make some time for letter writing. We’ll see if I do.</p></li>

<h1 id="dungeons-and-dragons-again"><a href="dungeons-dragons-7.html">Dungeons and Dragons Again</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 November 20</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As I said last week, I need to make a new character. Time passing, as it tends to, far too quickly, means that I did not get the new character made at all during the intervening hours. As I start this musing, I have less than 7 hours until the character is introduced to the group, which means that it’s time to generate character which rolls more dice.</p>
<p>I have the following things to optimize:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Race</p></li>
<li><p>Class</p></li>
<li><p>Background</p></li>
<li><p>Feats</p></li>
<li><p>Point buy spread</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I’m level four and get a bonus first level feat, which should help. Let’s start with Race, since I doubt that anything will really change too much. Other than a few racial feats, this is fairly self contained. I think my goal for a race is easier time criticalling, since crits double dice.</p>
<p>Race options that give benefits:<a href="#fn051" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Bugbear gets +5 feet on melee attacks, and I can think of places that would be useful. Also, +2d6 on a surprise round, which can happen often if we prepare well. It’s a clacky sometimes for sure.</p></li>
<li><p>Centaurs get the option to charge and then bonus attack as a bonus action. Situational for sure but</p></li>
<li><p>Custom lineage gives me a free feat, which can probably increase my dice rolls somehow.</p></li>
<li><p>Glitchling lets me reroll a 9 or lower, increases odds of hit</p></li>
<li><p>Grung lets me add a DC 12 Con saving throw to inflict 2d4 poison damage. I have to imagine most of the time people will succeed on that check, but not always I suppose</p></li>
<li><p>Half Orcs get an extra damage die on criticals with melee weapons</p></li>
<li><p>Lightfoot Halfling can hide behind any medium creature, which works well with Rogue</p></li>
<li><p>Variant Human also gets a free extra feat</p></li>
<li><p>Khenra lets me reroll any one as long as I can see my twin, so if I can convince someone else to play the race, could work.</p></li>
<li><p>Kobold lets me gain advantage on attack rolls proficiency modifier times a day</p></li>
<li><p>Kor lets me reroll every one, which is very strong.</p></li>
<li><p>Green Merfolk lets me hide when only lightly obscured by nature, similar to halfling</p></li>
<li><p>Minotaur lets me use a bonus action to attack with my horns if I take the dash action. Unfortunately, I think that I only get one bonus action a turn, so even if I dash as a bonus doesn’t work sadly.</p></li>
<li><p>Amonkhet Minotaur has the same thing as half orc where i get an extra die on criticals</p></li>
<li><p>Ixalan Orc also gets savage attacks</p></li>
<li><p>Revenant doesn’t work in any way for this goal, but does have the fun benefit of letting me bring my character back from the dead. Could be worth considering another time, esp since they cannot die</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Unsurprisingly, there are not too many options, especially given how many classes there are. Now I get to go through every feat available at or before fourth level to see how they balance, since I think that’ll be more impactful than backgrounds, and the two together should let me figure out my Class more effectively.</p>
<p>Relevant feats:<a href="#fn052" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Vital Sacrifice. I can take 1d6 necro damage to deal an extra 2d6 damage on an attack or spell. ok if I build a char resistant to necro damage, that’s legitimately tempting</p></li>
<li><p>Strike of the Giants: prof. bonus times I can add a die roll to a weapon attack</p></li>
<li><p>Squire of Solamnia<a href="#fn053" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> lets me add 1d8 prof. times</p></li>
<li><p>Spell sniper doubles range and lets me pick up a cantrip. Add that to warlock’s um eldritch blast and we get a fun thing</p></li>
<li><p>Sentinel lets me use my reaction to attack someone attacking an ally, or if they leave even if disengaging</p></li>
<li><p>Savage attacker 1/turn reroll my dice. Question becomes what I mean by rolling dice, because wow that’s fun</p></li>
<li><p>Polearm master lets me opportunity attack when they enter my space and also i can bonus action d4 attack. that plus bugbear and sentinel seems really fun</p></li>
<li><p>Piercer lets me reroll a piercing damage die once per turn and adds a damage die to any piercing critical. That stacks nicely</p></li>
<li><p>Orcish Fury lets me add one damage die once per long rest. That’s meh, but better than nothing.</p></li>
<li><p>Metamagic Adept - Empowered spell rerolls a damage die.</p></li>
<li><p>Metamagic Adept - Twinned spell doubles the attack dice</p></li>
<li><p>Martial Adept - Precision attack adds a die</p></li>
<li><p>Martial Adept - Quick toss lets me do a bonus attach thrown weapon which adds the die for damage</p></li>
<li><p>Mage Slayer makes it so I get to opportunity attack any mages in range</p></li>
<li><p>Lucky I’m pretty sure is banned</p></li>
<li><p>Great Weapon master lets me bonus attack another creature when I successfully reduce a monster to 0 hp or crit</p></li>
<li><p>Flames of Phlegethos lets me reroll all ones on fire damage from a spell</p></li>
<li><p>Fighting Initiate - Great Weapon Fighting lets me reroll 1 and 2s on melee damage dies from two handed and versatile weapons</p></li>
<li><p>Elven accuracy lets me reroll one non Str or Con die roll once whenever I have advantage. I’ve seen some people say that means three chances to crit</p></li>
<li><p>Cruel lets me add 1d6 damage to an attack prof bonus times a day.</p></li>
<li><p>Baleful Scion lets me do 1d6 necro damage and heal that much prof bonus times a day</p></li>
<li><p>Agent of Order lets me do 1d8 force damage prof bonus times a day</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Ok wow that’s a lot of options. Best options are those that do not limit the times I can use them explicitly, and come in the category of giving more places where I can attack and making attacks have more dice.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>More attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sentinel</p></li>
<li><p>Polearm Master</p></li>
<li><p>Mage Slayer</p></li>
<li><p>Great Weapon Master</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>More dice per Attack</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Vital Sacrifice</p></li>
<li><p>Savage Attacker</p></li>
<li><p>Piercer</p></li>
<li><p>Fighting Initiate - Great Weapon Fighting</p></li>
<li><p>Elven accuracy</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Ok so I think that it’s better for me to do more dice rather than roll more often. I feel like I generally use reactions and bonus actions, so the second category is probably better Aw shucks, Vital Sacrifice explicitly says I can’t reduce the damage I would take in gaining the boon, which is a shame, but does make sense because otherwise I build something with immunity to necrotic damage.</p>
<p>Most likely backgrounds won’t matter, and I’m very quickly running out of hours to figure this out. I think, at least at the level we are, Fighter makes the most sense. Champion at third level doubles my chances of a critical, and that’s really my only goal right now. For all that Great Weapon Fighting is considered subpar, it does increase the number of dice I get to roll.<a href="#fn054" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>I absolutely want Vital Sacrifice, and then I have to choose between Half Orc, elf, and Kor. If I choose Elf, I take Elven accuracy, which lets me reroll when I have advantage. If I take Half Orc, I get an extra damage die when I crit. If I take Kor, 1 on attacks become not one.</p>
<p>Ok so 1 will always miss, which means I roll no attacks. Kor feels better for that reason.</p>
<p>So I take Kor, Champion Fighter, and Vital Sacrifice. I still have my 4th level feat or raise statistics, point buy, and background to set up. There are far too many backgrounds but here we go:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Astral Drifter gives me Magic Initiate which gives me access to cantrips. Relevant ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Booming Blade: if creature moves after being hit, 1d8 thunder</p></li>
<li><p>Magic Stone: ranged weapons are nice</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Giant Foundling gives me Strike of the Giants</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I think Giant Foundling is the one to go for, especially because it works thematically. Now the question is whether it’s worth losing a level in Fighter for a level in rogue, which gives me access to sneak attack. I’m leaning towards probably not, because next level I get an extra attack. After that, though, might be worth switching over so I get extra dice.</p>
<p>Now time to generate stats and pick a weapon. I want something two handed so I benefit from great weapon master. Maul is the only two handed weapon other than double bladed scimitar, so I’ll take that. Mauls don’t do piercing damage, so that feat is out.</p>
<p>I’m going to do the nice sweet “dump dexterity, max out strength and constitution,” build. Assuming I’m allowed to take variant ability score increases, I’ll have</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Str: 15+1</p></li>
<li><p>Dex: 9</p></li>
<li><p>Con 15+2</p></li>
<li><p>Int 10</p></li>
<li><p>Wis 10</p></li>
<li><p>Cha 12</p></li>
</ul>
<p>From there, at fourth level I want a feat that increases my con by one, and then ideally adds hit points. Something that adds ac would also be nice. Vigor of Hill Giants seems like the choice, because I restore Con and Prof extra hit points every short rest. Since I know that I’ll be taking some damage from my feat, that’s a good idea I think. Oh, I wear chainmail, so Dex doesn’t matter, which is nice. Welp, sixteen hundred words later I now have my initial build for a creature. This took far more time than I thought it would, but in retrospect, I’ve never really read through all the options before. I’m sure that there will come a point where rogue will allow me more dice to roll, I just don’t really know when that would be.</p>
<p>Having now finished the session, things went well. I realized upon arriving that, even though I knew the mechanics of the character, I did not know such relevant information as name and appearance. I looked up Kor, and they’re apparently very washed out elf looking people. Alfred was the only name that I could think of, so that’s what he was named, and I decided that since he was also a giant foundling, he and Goob knew each other.</p>
<p>Anyways, we did not have any combat this session, which means that the only d6 I rolled were to inflict damage on myself with the hope that I might be able to use it next session. It was a fun time!</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write 1700 words for NaNoWriMo? Woo! Found out my plotting included some stuff I have accidentally already covered, so we’re good.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb? I finally finished the chapter that’s been driving me nuts for about a week now. It’s annoying, but I hope that I’ll be ready to do more in the next few days.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? A part of me feels badly about using work I was planning to do as a blog post. That part of me is less tired than the rest of me.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? I’ve fallen so far off of this goal.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing better at prayer than a rushed and thoughtless rosary? Yesterday’s rosary wasn’t too rushed, and I went to Mass, which was prayerful.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing a good job writing letters to friends? Still no. It is annoying to me that I can’t just write letters, for all that I respect the fact that there are a lot of things I want to do that I cannot do.</p></li>

<h1 id="reflections-on-todays-gospel"><a href="reflections-on-readings-33-ordinary-b.html">Reflections on Today’s Gospel</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 November 19</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today’s Gospel parable is the parable of the talents. It’s a parable I’ve always struggled with, for a few reasons.</p>
<p>The primary reason I’ve always struggled with it is that it doesn’t account for failure. The two options presented are either making more from what you are given, or not doing that. There is no fourth servant who attempted to trade his master’s property and failed.</p>
<p>I suppose that’s probably mostly just because it would muddy the story. The priest in today’s homily pointed out that a talent is around 100 pounds of precious metal. There’s certainly something to be said about the fact that the rich man trusted even his lowest servant with so much money, and it does do a lot to explain why the servant was so sure he would be able to find it after burying it.</p>
<p>There’s something else in the parable that sticks out to me right now, though. Even though at first the parable appears as a straightforward endorsement of capitalism, there are limits.</p>
<p>The first servant doubles his five talents to ten. That’s a 100 percent increase. However, he stops at that single doubling.</p>
<p>Some might argue that the market forces<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> would not support someone creating so much more than five talents of wealth. Ten talents might exhaust the field, creating a monopoly. The second servant, however, starts with two.</p>
<p>When he doubles his starting value, he has nearly as much as the first servant was given. If the message of the parable is that more is always better, then he should absolutely have doubled his investment again. And yet, he didn’t.</p>
<p>Now, as Catholics, we know a priori<a href="#fn062" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> that unbridled capitalism is not good.<a href="#fn063" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>In the context of what I assume we’re supposed to read the parable as, treating talents in the modern sense, rather than as a concept of wealth, it is a relieving distinction. Whatever gifts we are given are not needed to expand exponentially forever. As someone who finds that they’re constantly disappointed in lack of progress, that is a relieving proposition.</p>
<p>Of course, I mentioned at the beginning of this post that it bothers me that there is never an unsuccessful servant. Within the context of the parable, that does not necessarily hold. Those who try do not always succeed.</p>
<p>However, this is one of the places that<a href="#fn064" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> the fact that the story is a parable answers the question.<a href="#fn065" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> If our work is to use our talents for the building of the Kingdom, then there is no way for our work not to prosper.</p>
<p>They say that the road to hell is paved in good intentions. That may be true, but intentions are not action. To strive earnestly for a better world, with an open heart and mind, is to make the world a better place. Even if we do not see the ways in which our work helps those around us, we can be assured that there is no good we do which does not multiply to infinity.</p>
<p>As much as I want to go and read the reflections of great thinkers of the Church on this parable, I know that I need to take the advice I said above and not push for the sake of pushing. There are more upcoming hours in the day, and I hope that I will have the energy I need to do that reflection, but I will not count on it.</p>
<p>Update: I had my weekly bible study. This week, not all of the students were available, so we joined with another group. It is really interesting to see how much quieter my students are when surrounded by strangers. Even on the first day, when we were just meeting for the first time, they seemed much more willing to speak up than they were today.</p>
<p>I really hope that the same is not true for the other class’s students. I would hate to think that my being there made them uncomfortable sharing what they thought. Still, what little that each of the students said remained very well thought out.</p>
<p>Since I didn’t fill this out yesterday, two days of Daily Reflections:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write 1700 words for NaNoWriMo? I did yesterday, I have not yet today. As I said, though, there are a number of hours, which I hope to have time to do. Update: I have now written the words for the day. I’m starting to fall behind my plotting, which isn’t ideal, but is probably fine.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb? I wrote about 500 words yesterday. I wanted to write more, but I felt like the pace I was trying to set was much faster than the pace that I needed to write for the scene, which really deserved and demanded a lot of focus. As I said last week, I’m not going to write Jeb on Sundays, and I’m going to hold myself to that.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? Technically I blogged yesterday, for all that it was a few words. I also, as you can see, blogged here.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? I stretched my neck when stopped at stoplights.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing better at prayer than a rushed and thoughtless rosary? I think I fell asleep in the middle of my rosary on Friday, and I didn’t do one last night.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing a good job writing letters to friends? No. I have carried an unwritten letter with me for more than a week at this point, at every stop planning sincerely to write it.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Tonight I saw the same version of Twelfth Night that I saw <a href="twelfth-night.html">just over five years ago.</a> Of course, the cast and location were completely different. I didn’t think that I remembered any part of the show, but every time I heard one of the<a href="#fn071" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> musical numbers, it was like I was transported back to my time in London.

<p>Much like my musings in those days, I find that it’s late enough I have nothing else to say. Tomorrow I’ll do a comparative review, but tonight I must sleep.</p>

<h1 id="flash-fiction-friday"><a href="flash-fiction-227.html">Flash Fiction Friday</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 November 17</p>
<h1 id="draft-2-18-november-2023">Draft 2: 18 November 2023</h1>
<p>I find that I’m struggling to begin this second draft. On the one hand, I want to simply reflect on what I wrote last night. On the other, a reflection is its own post, not a new draft of a post. So, let’s rewrite my very scattered thoughts from last night into something a little more coherent, and then reflect?<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>As I mentioned <a href="flash-fiction.html">last Friday,</a> there is a weekly writing event called Flash Fiction Friday. I really like it as a concept, especially since they limit submissions to 100-1000 words. There’s something really nice about having to tell my narrative in such a tight format.</p>
<p>This week is apparently the 227th that they’ve put out a prompt. The prompt was “sands of time.” My mind immediately leapt between a number of ways that I could respond to the prompt, and I think it could be interesting to reflect on some of how my creative process works, if only to see if it helps me to construct narratives better in the future.</p>
<p>I do not think that I am alone in first thinking about an hourglass when thinking about the sands of time. There are so many ways that the concept is used in fiction that I’ve loved. Right now,<a href="#fn082" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> the first usage that popped into my head was Death in Discworld.<a href="#fn083" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>I’ve taken to rejecting the first idea that pops in my head reflexively. The second idea that pops into my head, by contrast, gets an inordinate amount of consideration. Yesterday, my second thought was how glass and sand relate.</p>
<p>As most people know, when you melt sand down, you get glass. As a person who has taken some coursework in material science, though, I am fascinated by the way that they two substances are so fundamentally different. Sand is crystalline, which in some circles of the world means that it is solid.<a href="#fn084" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> However, in bulk, sand behaves like a liquid. You can pour it, and it does not hold together without something to bind it.</p>
<p>Glass, by contrast, is definitionally a glass material.<a href="#fn085" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> It behaves, on incredibly long timescales, almost as though a liquid. This is because<a href="#fn086" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> it is completely amorphous.</p>
<p>An interesting consequence of this fact is that glass, even when ground down to particles the same size as the sand it was initially formed from, does not return to being sand. Instead, the tiny beads of glass remain completely amorphous. Now, I’m certain that over some time scale they eventually reconvert to crystalline, if only because I know a priori that a lot of the sand is, in fact, crystalline.<a href="#fn087" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>With that fact in mind, I started to think about what the metaphor becomes with sand and glass. Sand is a collection of completely discrete and stable particles. Glass is something solid and yet not static at all.</p>
<p>From there, my mind immediately moved to glass as memory. Memories feel and seem stable, but there countless studies that show how intrinsically fluid they are. At that point, I had sand as moments of time, and glass as the meaning someone constructs.</p>
<p>I tried framing the story in a few ways, though I ultimately ended up with something that felt more like literature or philosophy than a short work of fiction.<a href="#fn088" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> I ended my musing by saying both that I would read the post in the morning, and that I thought I would dislike it.</p>
<p>The friend I’m writing with this morning and early afternoon read my post and asked me to expound on my claim that “here is no genuine way to express something complex.” So, let’s go through the post and see what we think.</p>
<p>I feel like it’s a really rough post. As I said, there was not really a narrative. Reading it today, it really feels like what I have is the bones of a story, rather than the story itself. That being said, I don’t find it pretentious, which is a nice change.</p>
<p>Alright, let’s explore why I feel like expressing complexity inherently relies on artifice. I find that I’m immediately drawn to a conversation I had with a friend on Wednesday. As it turns out, this friend has a degree in poetry<a href="#fn089" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>, and he told me about an experience he had in one of his upper level classes.</p>
<p>One of his classmates refused to rewrite any poem. The classmate tried to justify it by saying that the poem expressed what it tried to express. To edit a poem was to compromise the artistic vision.</p>
<p>That anecdote came as we discussed the way that learning to revise is such a difficult skill. Separating the created work from the inspiration of creation is a difficult endeavor, especially as the creator.</p>
<p>I’m struggling to articulate how that prior sentence connects to my feeling of artifice. I think that, at first, everything is black and white, at least to me.<a href="#fn0810" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> To add nuance is to explicitly reject the initial impression.</p>
<p>I suppose that takes us to the question of what genuine means. Is my most genuine reaction the first impulse I have, or is it what I decide to believe when I have the chance to explore the consequences of each belief? I don’t have a good answer, for all that I have some more ways of musing about the difficulty of being genuine and nuanced.</p>
<p>I’ll use an example from my own life. When I write these posts, I often start by using identifying information about the people in my life. However, I do not want to harm them in the real world, and I know that there is a chance that anything I say here, regardless of how innocuous it feels at the time, could later come back to haunt one of the two of us. With that in mind, I scrub the identifying information as best as I can, until I’m sure that sometimes I’ve referenced people in a way that they would not even recognize as themselves if they were to read my blog.</p>
<p>As I keep writing each post, though, I fall into the mindset of anonymizing information. By the end of each draft, I instinctively write about others in a way that makes them faceless beings who exist solely in the context of the narrative I’m telling.<a href="#fn0811" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Which register of my writing is the real me? Is it the one who uses friend’s names, or the one who writes this blog?</p>
<p>I find that my gut reaction is to say, here, at least, the way that I construct the narrative as I write it is the genuine article. At the beginning of the post, the real me refers to friends by names. By the end of the post, the real me refers to friends only in how they intersect the story.</p>
<p>When I go back to add nuance, however, I have to choose which register to use for the entirety of the post. Since I made the conscious decision long ago to have this blog not name others explicitly, that is the register I shift things to. Given that I write each musing with the understanding that it will be posted, there’s an easy argument to be made that what I meant to construct from the beginning was something that did not refer to people by name.</p>
<p>Abstracting back to the general question of what it means to be genuine, there is a tension between what is created and the vision. Naively, the creation feels like the most genuine version of an act of creation. After all, there is no way to perfectly recreate the conditions that lead to every decision we make. No man can cross the same river twice, and everything we effect affects us.<a href="#fn0812" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>However, like most naive conceptions, that idea does not hold up perfectly to scrutiny. If I write a song about love, I almost always want there to be rhyme, because I feel like the sing songy nature of rhyming couplets fits well with my conception of what a love song should be. If I end my first line with something difficult to rhyme, though, it does not compromise the idea to change that word.</p>
<p>After rambling far further than I meant to for a revised and trimmed draft, I think I do believe it’s possible to discuss something complex in a genuine fashion. I think that it requires a separation of intent from creation, though, which feels artificial in a lot of contexts.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>It’s another Friday, which means that it’s time for another musing about the Flash Fiction I’m planning to write today. It’s far later than I’d like to be starting this musing, but I don’t regret the time that I spent doing other things today.<a href="#fn0813" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> The prompt today is “sands of time.”</p>
<p>Probably because I have thought about sand for the book I’m writing<a href="#fn0814" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>, I immediately thought about the fact that sand is crystalline, while glass is amorphous. While walking home, I considered a little more in depth how I could use that to a narrative.</p>
<p>I think that there’s something to the idea of each individual grain of sand being an explicit passage of time. Regardless of how we feel about it, there exists an objective way to measure the time displacement that occurs on earth. What’s more meaningful by far, though, is the way that we turn these objective passings into a narrative. I’m not entirely sure how to make fire or heat into the metaphor, but maybe there’s something about lightning which forms fulgerites.</p>
<p>Ok actually, I love the idea of fulgerites.</p>
<p>So, let’s reconstruct the narrative from there. A fulgerite is a place where lightning has melted and reformed the sand into an interesting shape. Sand, as sort of given in the prompt, is the passing of time. Lightning is a person constructing meaning out of a series of events. The result is a memory.</p>
<p>This feels like something that might be better expressed as a poem, for all that I refuse to do this as anything but prose.<a href="#fn0815" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Ok, let’s go through the same sets of questions I asked myself last week. My FFF question set apparently is:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Why am I writing it? Today, because I want to explore this idea of time as observation. I’m realizing that a lot of how I view myself as a more literary writer is by emphasizing the importance of observation and human naming. That’s probably worth interrogating on another occasion.<a href="#fn0816" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Person? Right now I’m leaning towards a third/fourth person telling.<a href="#fn0817" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Any other gimmicks? I don’t think so today.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Alright, time to try writing this. I think that I’ll let it be more poetic in phrasing than I tend to emphasize, in large part because I find that I wax poetic the later at night it is.<a href="#fn0818" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Well, I wrote it, and redrafted it at least four times. I switched between first and third person accounts of the narrative as I went through the different drafts, which I think did a lot to help me tell the story that I wanted. In my author’s note, I admitted that I don’t know if what I wrote really counts as prose or poetry, but I am as happy with it as I think I will be. I’m sure that in the morning I’ll read what I wrote and feel like it was too pretentious or trying too hard to be deep.<a href="#fn0819" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>It’s now well past time for sleep, so I’ll do my questions and head. Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write 1700 words for NaNoWriMo? I did! I’m now officially a full day ahead of schedule.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb? I wrote my ideas for the chapter and about 500 words of content. As I mentioned at the top, today was far longer than I planned on, for all that I do not regret it.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? I’m realizing that I can use footnotes for all my long diversions, which lets my actual text be<a href="#fn0820" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> more coherent.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? No.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing better at prayer than a rushed and thoughtless rosary? No? I feel like I’ve thought about my place in the universe a fair amount, which involves a certain level of prayerful intention for me, but I haven’t done anything explicitly so.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing a good job writing letters to friends? Today passed too quickly. Yesterday I mentioned making a to do list, and that did absolutely help a lot. Tomorrow I plan to spend a fair amount of time writing with my friend, which should give me the space I need to get through the chapter of Jeb I’d like to write, the NaNo writing I need to do, and the letter that I feel like I should write.<a href="#fn0821" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> Should is probably the wrong word. At this point, I’ve written all the letters to people I felt an obligation to write. What’s left is the letters I want to write. Framing it that way is probably healthier.</p></li>

<li id="fn083" role="doc-endnote"><p>Wow I really need to reread Discworld soon. Now that I’m in the part of my life where I want to focus on craft, the fact that Pratchett manages to tell such deep, complex, and interesting stories in such a small number of pages. Given that the majority of what I’m reading these days is serialized fiction, which, much like Dickens, uses hundreds of words where a single could suffice, I think it will be interesting to focus on how to tell a tighter story. Anyways, back to the musing<a href="#fn08ref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn086" role="doc-endnote"><p>I think, don’t quote me. Most of this information comes from vague recollections of the polymer class that I took the semester I started this blog.<a href="#fn08ref6" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn087" role="doc-endnote"><p>the rant about a priori knowledge having value is going to come at some point, as soon as I can figure out how to make it cogent.<a href="#fn08ref7" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn088" role="doc-endnote"><p>the line between the three is incredibly hazy, I’ll happily admit. It just feels like there’s something to the fact that there was only implicit story in my writing, rather than the explicit narrative that I shoot for normally. Actually, as I think about it, that tends to separate the prose and poetry I write from a lot of what I think of when i think of literature or philosophy. There tends to be explicit change in the writing I do, a way in which the world the story or poem is placed has changed as a result of the story being told. (That phrasing works with my apparent goal for FFF, which is trying to find a way to describe the fact that the action of assigning meaning is, itself, meaningful.)<a href="#fn08ref8" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn089" role="doc-endnote"><p>on some level, I didn’t really ask exactly what the degree was, but I know that the friend wrote a senior thesis of poetry (I wonder if there’s something inherently dehumanizing about the way that I try to anonymize everyone else that I refer to in these musings. It certainly does something to remind me that this posting is, on some level, artificial (shoot that belongs outside of the footnote. Will bring up to explore))<a href="#fn08ref9" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0810" role="doc-endnote"><p>there are essays about how that phrase is problematic, and I’ve considered how I feel about it. At this point, I don’t know that I have a phrase which works better, and I find that policing language with the explicit goal of never saying anything even potentially harmful is itself a way to harm. Shoot, that also belongs in the main text<a href="#fn08ref10" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0811" role="doc-endnote"><p>hmm I wonder if that tendency is part of why people have commented so much on the characterization in my books.<a href="#fn08ref11" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0812" role="doc-endnote"><p>ooh I love that ending phrase, for all that I also know I would hate having to read it<a href="#fn08ref12" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0813" role="doc-endnote"><p>more or less from 4:30 on tonight I’ve been celebrating a close friend’s birthday, and that seems more important to me than an arbitrary writing goal. I’m sure that there’s something to be said about finding a balance for writing where it can be the main thing that I do, but still takes a backseat to the important parts of my life. I should reflect on that further, and this footnote feels like as good of a place as any to do so. (I don’t want the main content of this blog post to be my reflection on writing, because I decided arbitrarily that it would be planning for the flash fiction (as you might have seen from the opening line))</p>
<p>I do very much appreciate the fact that I write. I love looking back at the content I’ve read, and there’s a part of me that beams whenever someone tells me they’ve enjoyed anything I’ve written. I can look at the writing I’ve done through the years and see a clear upward trend in quality, or at least quality per unit time. I feel like, at a general level, at least, the second draft of anything non fiction I write is about twice as good as the first draft, and it often takes far less time. However, all the content that goes into the first draft is important.</p>
<p>Last week’s musing on the readings is a great example. Before I had written the very long reflection, I don’t think that I would have gotten to the musing that I had. The second draft is strong, in large part, because the first draft is willing to take so many detours.</p>
<p>So, how do I square that reality with the fact that I find my writing improving? There are two ways. First, I find that the rabbit holes my mind explores are generally better the more I’ve written and read in my life. I continue to grow as a person, and continue to find better ways to express a truth that I see or feel or believe. Second, I get through each diversion more quickly. For all that I am willing to ramble through these musings, I strongly prefer being able to do them in a single sitting. The composite reality that the more I write, the more comfortable I am with spending a continuous amount of time writing and the fact that the more I write the physically faster I write means that I get through a lot more content in a first draft of a rambling musing. There’s the part I’m not addressing here which is that the quality of my first drafts is also increasing a fair amount, simply because my mind is getting better at plotting how a small narrative will end from a beginning.</p>
<p>All this to say, I think that the healthiest thing for me is to have writing be an important part of my life, but a part that is always able to be superseded by a friend or other social event. I know myself well enough to know that I am healthier when I spend more time with friends.<a href="#fn08ref13" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<h1 id="ib-thesis-prep"><a href="thesis-prep.html">Ib Thesis Prep</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 November 16</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>his morning, after my more or less daily writing session for NaNoWriMo<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, I realized that I had no clue what I wanted to write about tonight. It was suggested that I could muse on fan fiction, generally as a concept, and that seemed like a strongly potential idea.</p>
<p>However, my day ended up being far more eventful than I had expected. I’ll go through the particularly notable events as a series of vignettes, before seeing if I have something I can find a title for as a musing. If not, hopefully I’ll be inspired to find something to muse about from my journaling here.<a href="#fn092" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>While walking to work, I realized that I haven’t updated my yearly goals, which is a big oopsie. It’s a little late for that<a href="#fn093" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, but I put it on my to do list for tomorrow, so hopefully I remember to do it. Anyways, among the exciting things of the day was reading a really interesting old paper.</p>
<p>The paper itself was fun, but it cited a few textbooks for explanations of derivations. As it turns out, the textbooks were simply early quantum texts, and just framed how the Born Oppenheimer approximation<a href="#fn094" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> is justified. I realized how much I really appreciate older textbooks. There are absolutely a number of reasons for that. One major one, I realized today, is due to the limits of the system.</p>
<p>I read recently about how absolutely weird it really is that we can have so many images in all of our scientific papers these days. In earlier times, it was a massive pain to get images into books, especially if you didn’t want to dedicate an entire page to them. As a result, rather than simply being able to go “as you can see from the graphs,” authors had to consider how to best<a href="#fn095" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> communicate information without visuals.</p>
<p>I think that there’s also an element of novelty that modern textbook authors miss. The textbook I read today, for instance, explained that it is clear that there is an optimal location for all the nuclei in a molecule that is neither totally compressed<a href="#fn096" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> nor infinitely separated<a href="#fn097" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>. I said that to my group mates, and most of them rolled their eyes and said it was obvious. It is obvious, to me, who has now taken three semesters of explicitly quantum chemistry and had the concept implicitly taught in any other number of courses. If it was my first semester in quantum, though, I think that framing would be helpful. That is, we know that there is an optimal structure, and we can constrain it slightly.</p>
<p>Honestly, I kind of just want to go into my rant right now, but I said I’d do a few vignettes, so we’ll rush through them. Probably because of the way I loved the textbook, a few group members started to joke about how long my thesis will be. One phrase that came up more than once is “you should really be getting a degree in philosophy”, which makes me kind of sad. The degree that I’m going for is explicitly a doctorate of philosophy. Just because the modern world has moved past the idea that a Ph. D. is meant to represent philosophical reflections on the field, I don’t see why I need to.</p>
<p>Anyways, I realized that there are a number of ways that I could write an absurdly long thesis, if I felt so called.<a href="#fn098" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> There are a few ways that I could pad the length, which I will discuss after finishing vignettes.</p>
<p>I then found out that my choir rehearsal was cancelled for the night. Almost immediately after that, someone in the choir asked if I wanted to sign up for a date auction with them. I had no reason to say no, said yes, and then went to a young adult social night, which was really fun.</p>
<p>I also went to a cool seminar and got lunch with the seminar speaker today. I think that’s most of the vignettes. Onto the meat of today’s post: my path to an infinite thesis.</p>
<p>There are really two paths that can increase the length of my thesis: going deeper and going wider. To go wider is easy, I just have to make a wider claim of what I did that is relevant to my degree. Since I have given talks as part of my degree on a variety of subjects, there is an argument to be made that I should<a href="#fn099" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> dedicate some space to them. Of course, a long discourse on tuning theory may feel slightly off tone in a chemistry dissertation, which is where going deeper goes.</p>
<p>Going deeper can mean a lot of different things. Especially since I’m doing a fairly heavy computational project, I feel like having a description of how we can start at a molecule and get to rotational numbers would not be bad. However, since I like to take things to an extreme level, there are other ways we can frame it.</p>
<p>One joking idea was the history of the universe as seen through the lens of rotational spectroscopy.<a href="#fn0910" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> In the beginning, there was the big bang. There were no molecules, so it’s not interesting.</p>
<p>The first stars formed. They also didn’t have any molecules with dipoles, at most having diatomic hydrogen, so are also not interesting.<a href="#fn0911" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Then the stars exploded. Those are all ions and atoms, so not interesting.<a href="#fn0912" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>As much as I think that could be a fun thing to do, and may try as a creative writing exercise, that is not quite as academic as many might want for a thesis.<a href="#fn0913" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> However, there’s another way to go deeper. As I said, I could go through how we go from a molecular structure to rotational constants.</p>
<p>There’s no reason that I need to stop at molecular structure, though. We could go one layer deeper, to how atoms create molecules. Now, if I were a particle physicist, I could go the step lower to how atoms are constructed, but, again, the degree is philosophy. Especially since the conception of an atom is an interesting historical trail, it could be fun to trace that. One other cool thing could be to take some metaphysics.</p>
<p>I could<a href="#fn0914" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> go into a whole discourse on what matter is, not as a matter of physics but as a philosophical thing. I did say a few times that one goal I have for a thesis is that I can<a href="#fn0915" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> use it as a text for any course I could likely teach in the future. Now, does anyone really think that’s an appropriate idea? I sure kind of do, but I don’t know if it will be approved.</p>
<p>Oh! Right, I was going to rant about modern textbook design. I think another issue is that people today are too afraid of using words. There are reasons for this, to be sure.</p>
<p>First and foremost, writing is no longer emphasized at any real level of education for a growing scientist. You can see this in who gets recruited for technical writing. Companies find it easier to teach English majors science than science majors how to write.</p>
<p>It goes deeper than that, though. I think that most of the scientists I know only try to speak to other members of the field.<a href="#fn0916" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> There are shades of this, obviously.</p>
<p>I’m only going to be writing to people fluent in English, for instance. That does cut out a large portion of the world. If I cut it down to chemists who understand basic chemical nomenclature, that cuts it down significantly again. Most people would argue that a Ph. D. thesis can be targeted to at least the level of an upperclassman undergraduate in a field, though.</p>
<p>The issue I have is that people go even further than that. They repeatedly use phrases that only have meaning to people within their own specific subfield, sometimes to the point that there are maybe twenty people in the world who can understand the jargon. In a research paper, I can understand and even respect that choice. After all, a research paper is meant to focus towards the field. There are other avenues to share research with the broader public.<a href="#fn0917" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>I think that in a lot of people’s views, a thesis is just a continuation of that thought. Ok, think is probably a bit of an understatement. Given that the prevailing way to construct a thesis that I’ve seen recently is just stapling papers together, it is exactly the thought process.</p>
<p>Ope I never said why I respect the choice. Jargon has a purpose, and I will never deny it. There are shades of meaning, and it is far more efficient and effective to use a word with shared meaning rather than dancing one’s way around it for a paragraph. If I want to talk about benzene, for instance, there is no reason that I should have to describe it as a structure where each of six carbons is joined in a ring with on average one and a half bonds to its two neighbors.<a href="#fn0918" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> If I’m going to talk about benzene to a broader audience, though, I might need to do that.</p>
<p>Of course, if I’m talking to a broader audience, I might have to take the step back and explain what a bond is, and what exactly separates carbon from every other element. I might also, depending on the context I’m speaking about benzene, not need to reference its structure at all. If I’m describing the fact that there are many clear liquids, for instance, I can just say that benzene exists.</p>
<p>I do agree that I think a little more philosophically about my research than most of my peers, I’m realizing during this musing. Much like a child that asks “why” to each successive answer, I’m dissatisfied with ending my field at something above first principles. Of course, first principles means different things in different situations.</p>
<p>I cannot think of a way that I can meaningfully connect the Higgs-Boson to the rotational constant of a molecule, for instance. There are reasons for this.</p>
<p>One major reason is emergent properties. An emergent property is just when an ensemble of something behaves differently than you would expect from a single piece. It’s related to another concept that I can’t remember the name of but that I’m sure I remember an XKCD about. I can’t find the comic right now, for all that I remember it clearly.<a href="#fn0919" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Ok the concept is called reductionism, and it says that you can explain something by just explaining its component parts. The comic points out the ridiculousness of this approach, by separating the word “reductionism” into its component letters and their specific meanings. I don’t really like reductionism as a concept, and particularly not when looking at my molecules. They are fundamentally different than a collection of quarks, and I don’t know how much learning about quarks helps you to understand the rotations.</p>
<p>Of course, the same is true for any piece of information. On its own, it has no use. It gains value almost by existence of any other piece of information.</p>
<p>Anyways, while I don’t think that it’s useful to describe first principles in Chemistry<a href="#fn0920" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> as anything smaller than an atom. Of course, there are other orthogonal directions we can take.</p>
<p>Ensemble averages in statistical mechanics, for instance, are only really useful when you explain the quantum classical divide. Rotational spectroscopy, when I take a step back and look at it, is kind of wild. It’s inherently a statistical mechanics problem, because we’re probing millions and trillions of molecules and seeing how they respond in ensemble averages. However, the way that they respond still correlates really neatly to discrete quantum transitions. I’m sure there’s something analogous between the way that pressure broadening makes multiple lines look like one line and the way that energy levels become bands in metals.</p>
<p>Oh gosh, energy levels are something I haven’t even thought about or addressed. In general chemistry, they’re all over the place. Despite the fact that I’m doing quantized transitions, we never really use them in rotational spectroscopy.<a href="#fn0921" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> I wonder why that is.</p>
<p>A few reasons pop to mind immediately. For one, we often work with well over ten thousand energy levels. In order to represent that on a page in any meaningful way, the page would need to be massive.</p>
<p>Ope ok so returning to the essay. People today are afraid of language, which has a lot of reasons. I’m not afraid of having a distinct voice in my thesis, which I think will help, and I’m not against making it broadly understandable. I’m willing to put forth the extra energy to make it theoretically approachable.</p>
<p>Older textbooks come from a place of authors also not knowing as much, because the fields had so much less information. As a result, if they had five pages to fill on quantum mechanics, there was less information they needed to cram, which meant there was more time that could be taken to explain. Anyways, this feels like a good place to end for the night. It’s a rambly musing to be sure, but I plan to spend some time in the coming days and weeks revising some of these rambles.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write 1700 words for NaNoWriMo? I did! Just updated on the site too</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb? I did not. As mentioned, today was a busy day, which mean that I had less time and space to write. Halfway through the month, I’m more ok with the fact that I can’t write a long blog post and a chapter of Jeb a day. Right now I’m valuing the long posts more than the Jeb.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? This feels incredibly rambly, but I feel like I touched on a lot of things that I would otherwise forget and want to remember.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? I did stretch after last night, but not today.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing better at prayer than a rushed and thoughtless rosary? I spent time around Catholics and spent some time reading the book of essays, so kind of.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing a good job writing letters to friends? I really felt like I would have time for it today, but didn’t. The hours passed way too quickly. I need to get back into writing things down physically. For whatever reason, an inked page is easier for me to follow than a webpage. I keep hoping that won’t be true, but it keeps being true, and I need to learn to accept that fact.</p></li>

<li id="fn092" role="doc-endnote"><p>the fact that I treat this site as a journal is certainly an interesting change. Oh! I just remembered that one other idea I was given/ came to was reflecting on whatever I posted about five years ago today (the first year of the blog, and the most successful iteration). It’s a little strange to realize that I started this blog almost a fifth of my life ago. It feels both like far more than a fifth of my life has passed me by and like I’m exactly the same person I was then.

<li id="fn095" role="doc-endnote"><p>that phrasing felt wrong for a second. I realize it’s because I’m splitting the infinitive, which was frowned upon in early American grammatical conventions. The reason, like many, comes from the fact that everyone agrees that Latin is the best language. Since Latin has one word infinitives, you cannot split them. As a result, people thought we should not do it in English either. I hate that for a lot of reasons, not least that I like the fact that to go quickly and to quickly go have shades of different meaning.

<li id="fn0910" role="doc-endnote"><p>or, later, through the lens of a bunch of different disciplines.<a href="#fn09ref10" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0911" role="doc-endnote"><p>ooh, I suppose D existed, so you could have like DHD+, which does have a dipole. Shoot<a href="#fn09ref11" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0912" role="doc-endnote"><p>I think you can see where this is going. In some regards it’s a play on a semi famous quote in astronomy that things are either chemistry or interesting.<a href="#fn09ref12" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0913" role="doc-endnote"><p>hmmmm, I wonder if there’s a way to phrase and structure the chapter so that it is interesting. Cosmology as seen through rotational spectroscopy is limited, of course, but also hmmmm. I will consider more<a href="#fn09ref13" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0914" role="doc-endnote"><p>initially typed we, because I thought of this as a science thing, and as we know, science uses the royal we (a phrase not all my friends know about for some reason)<a href="#fn09ref14" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0915" role="doc-endnote"><p>changes in scientific understanding independent<a href="#fn09ref15" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0916" role="doc-endnote"><p>I know that it is a fairly common reaction when I say that I give a lot of public talks that scientists don’t like to do it (this is phrased badly, and is a sign I should start wrapping up this musing before my brain goes too much more to mush)<a href="#fn09ref16" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0917" role="doc-endnote"><p>for all that no one really uses them ever<a href="#fn09ref17" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0918" role="doc-endnote"><p>especially since that’s slightly inaccurate.<a href="#fn09ref18" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0919" role="doc-endnote"><p>I found it! <a href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1734:_Reductionism">Reductionism</a><a href="#fn09ref19" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0920" role="doc-endnote"><p>generally. I fully acknowledge the fuzzy edges of the discipline, but here I’m speaking for at the very least the chemistry I’m doing, which relies on molecules only barely being constructed of atoms (in that like we abstract away atomic information as quickly and fully as possible)<a href="#fn09ref20" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0921" role="doc-endnote"><p>I’m realizing this isn’t true. We do when discussing coriolis coupling, which is where two rotational transitions of similar energy both shift slightly to have even more similar energy. I’m a little unclear why that happens, but I think it’s something about how vibrational and rotational energies aren’t actually separable, we just pretend they are and add fudge factors<a href="#fn09ref21" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
