<p>First Published: 2025 April 7</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-7-april-2025">Draft 1: 7 April 2025</h1>
<p>I think a lot about the way that my life is and will be, especially these past few months. In part, I am absolutely sure that this is because dealing with a death, even one which is far from sudden, makes anyone think about the way that they’re spending their own time on the earth. In part, I think it has something to do with the fact that I’m closing a chapter of my life. Before I turn to the next section, I would like to think that it will be a better one.<a href="#fn001" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>I remember watching a video a few years ago that really changed the way that I view a lot of the goals I set. I am well aware of the SMART<a href="#fn002" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> method, but I find that a lot of the things I want to do are fundamentally not either of the first, and as a result, hard to know the achievability or timeline for. When life doesn’t work with a plan, one can either change the plan or the life. Since goal setting is to help me live, I want the goals to reflect my life, and not the other way around.</p>
<p>I think that the video was initially set about new year’s resolutions, and it talked about how, at the end of the day<a href="#fn003" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, most of these goals, even when framed as SMART ones, are not really the actual goal. A goal to stop eating sweets, for instance, is more likely the method to meet some real goal, such as improving health or managing blood sugar. As someone pointed out once<a href="#fn004" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref4"><sup>4</sup></a>, a measure stops being effective when it becomes a goal. We see this all the time, such as how standardized tests effectively became the curriculum taught in public schools. The goal of a standardized test was to see children’s general knowledge. Instead, it becomes about how well a student has been prepared for the specific exam.</p>
<p>Also, especially with New Year’s Resolutions<a href="#fn005" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref5"><sup>5</sup></a>, life circumstances change rapidly in a way that makes SMART goals bad. If I twist my ankle on the fifteenth with a goal of running daily, then I’ll have to stop. If, instead, the goal was something broader, like improving my physical fitness, I can instead start rowing or swimming or anything else. In general, the author stated confidently, themes can be the answer to your life.</p>
<p>As I’ve grown, I find myself trusting common wisdom about change less and less.<a href="#fn006" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref6"><sup>6</sup></a> While I have not had much luck with themes, something he said was very impactful.</p>
<p>Butchering the metaphor, as is my right as an author, think of your life as a road. We cannot change the path we have taken. And, in general, any choice we make does not truly diverge us that much.<a href="#fn007" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref7"><sup>7</sup></a> However, each choice we make turns us slightly more into the kind of person who makes those kinds of choices. Every time we eat a salad, our brains are a little more tuned to eating salads. Every time that we do a kindness for no reason save itself, we become slightly kinder.</p>
<p>Is that a particularly deep or profound metaphor? Maybe not to the average reader. However, I find it far more helpful to me than thinking about goals. I do not really want to be a runner, so practicing running doesn’t make a lot of sense. I do, however, want to be an older person who is described as “shockingly, almost horrifyingly spry”, and so want to practice the exercises that will both lead me to being spry today as well as lay a good foundation for me to age.</p>
<p>A habit is, by most definitions, something we do without conscious thought. That is, it is when we follow the twists in the road without consideration. A metaphor I used in my web novel was the river of fate.<a href="#fn008" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref8"><sup>8</sup></a> We are all riding rafts down a stream which never ends. Following the path set for you is not just easy, it is effortless.</p>
<p>Like any other source of flowing water, though, the more you wish to diverge from the main flow, the more effort it takes. Rerouting the river itself is nearly impossible, especially the wider and stronger the river is. The metaphor gets a bit strained here, because each action we take is making the riverbed ahead of us, so I suppose that a better analogy might be a river shrouded in mist. We get to decide what comes next, but rivers tend to flow a specific way.</p>
<p>All this to say, not making choices is the default way people go through the world. Better habits lead to better lives because choosing the good is difficult, not because of the word good, but because of the word choose. All choices take effort, and so the goal for me is less any individual good habit or virtuous thing and much more about shifting who I am to become the sort of person who does not have to think about doing good. Everything yearns to rest, and so making the good easier is the best thing that I can do.</p>
<p>Hmm, I’m not super happy with this, because I don’t really think that I said anything that meaningful, and what shreds of meaning may have made their way in are obscured by the filler of my stream of consciousness. Still, it is also important to accept what is, rather than what I wish would be.</p>
<h1 id="daily-notes">Daily Notes</h1>
<p>The astute reader might note that this has changed. I don’t think that spending twenty minutes a day on the daily goals is necessarily serving me well right now, so I tried to pare it down. I will likely pare down even further before the time is through</p>

<p>Did my time today!</p>
<p>Averaged just under 6.2 characters a second, unlocked letters through “u”, and generally felt like I was doing ok. Interestingly, my average speed decreased through the lessons on almost every letter. Wonder what that’s about. I don’t get new letters until I’m at 5 characters per second on the previous letters, which I really like as a system, because 5 is just about where it stops feeling like something that I need to think about at all. There’s something to be said for more incremental changes to be sure, especially since the default goal is less than three characters per second. Still, once I’m at 5 per second in all letters, I think that I’ll start working on punctuation and capitalization. If I can get all of that together up to 5 per second, then it’s on to six, and so on until I either give up, die, or max out the program.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep the phone out of the room for bed</p>
<p>Did not do this, and started a new audio book, which I am enjoying. I’m listening to it at single speed, and I’m more and more thinking that this publisher<a href="#fn009" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref9"><sup>9</sup></a> records books with the assumption that they’ll be listened to at greater than single times speed. Still, there’s nothing that I really gain from listening faster, especially since there are no other books that I’m trying to consume right now. Learning to go slower is almost never a bad thing.</p></li>
<li><p>Pray St. Michael Chaplet in the morning</p>
<p>I did not do this today or yesterday, which isn’t great.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch in the morning</p>
<p>I did that today, though certainly not for an hour. I think that I should have time tonight to do so, though, which will hopefully help me. I found that I was incredibly tight in the front of my chest today, so I have confidence that stretching is doing something.<a href="#fn0010" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref10"><sup>10</sup></a> My back also seized when I bent over suddenly, which I don’t like. Might be good to start some lower back stretches.<a href="#fn0011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Read at night</p>
<p>Nope.</p></li>
<li><p>Poetry at night</p>
<p>Nope.</p></li>
<li><p>Clean the home</p>
<p>Spent time this morning! Realized, as I tend to, that one of the big issues in my life is storage. I’ve been keeping spices above the stove, but<a href="#fn0012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref12"><sup>12</sup></a> that area gets fairly hot, which is not good for spice storage. It’s really not good for most storage, but I think that I have enough things that are non-consumable that I can make it work.<a href="#fn0013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Stretching, standing, drinking water</p>
<p>I did kind of ok with this yesterday, other than the time period where I left my water at primary location and moved to secondary. Stretching, generally not as much as I’d like.</p></li>
<li><p>Posture</p>
<p>So I have realized that I instinctively cross my legs, which is weird, and a habit I think that I would like to break. I catch myself doing it so often, though. Even lying in bed, my right foot goes over the left.</p></li>
<li><p>No wasted time</p>
<p>Generally decently, although I did spend a while yesterday looking for pen ink, I enjoy writing enough that I’m willing to call that time decently, if not well, spent.</p></li>
<li><p>Eat more than 2 meals a day<a href="#fn0014" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>I ate two and a bit yesterday!<a href="#fn0015" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Goals and Growth:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ends:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Letter writing, get into more</p>
<p>Did Not write yesterday, will not write today or likely tomorrow or the rest of the week. I need to lower the barrier to going to my jail cell in the library, or else I should just be honest with myself and take the letters elsewhere. Hard to decide either way.</p></li>
<li><p>Handwriting, pick and make the new one</p>
<p>In reading the book about gentlemanly etiquette, I was reminded that the primary goal of any hand<a href="#fn0016" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref16"><sup>16</sup></a> should be legibility. A secondary consideration is normally speed, but I think that my personal priority list puts that at the end of the list. For my new hand, I’m prioritizing legibility first, as anything I write I want to be read, and read easily. Next I have uniqueness.</p>
<p>I know that it’s ridiculous to want my handwriting to be different just for the sake of being different, but I have a few justifications. First, it makes it slightly harder for someone to falsify something as having been written by me, even if that is unlikely. Second, it makes life more fun to look at something fun. It doesn’t have to be unique in the sense of never seen, just in the sense of not commonly seen today.</p>
<p>The next priority is beauty. Beauty is not necessarily quantifiable, but for anything practical, it does have elements of both form and function. Anything which passes the first criterion<a href="#fn0017" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref17"><sup>17</sup></a> will satisfy the functional element. If it is also unique, I find it unlikely that I will not find the writing beautiful. However, if I have to choose any specific character’s beauty or originality, it is good to remember the priorities I have set.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to consider speed. Although I do not ever really need to write quickly by hand, I am not hoping for calligraphy. My writing needs to be done at a writing pace, which means that, by and large, extraneous strokes and flourishes don’t get to exist. Finding a hand that satisfies all of these criteria is difficult, to be sure, but most of the fun in getting a script is playing with options. I think I might go letter by letter, if only because that way I can really focus to make sure I’m able to reproduce the exact thing I want.</p>
<p>Also, cursive script is sadly out, because so many people these days cannot read it. Even though I can and think that more people should be able to, I want my writing to be able to be read by anyone.</p>
<p>Oh, I guess it’s an unstated thing before this, but I want the handwriting to scale. That is, I want to be able to draw the same shapes on a small note, a notebook, and a whiteboard or blackboard and have it look fine, if not good. Why? Because why go through the effort of making beauty if I do not commit to it?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Means:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Typing speed, improve it.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, I have been working on that.</p></li>
<li><p>Reading, do more of it</p>
<p>Yesterday, while spending time with the friend, we had a fair amount of downtime where conversation did not need to occur. I kept reading the book I started a few months ago when I was reading more, and I forgot how much I enjoy it. I do also want to reread one series, which I’m not letting myself do at least until I finish this book.<a href="#fn0018" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Blogging, do it</p>
<p>Look at this! Of the seven days of the month, I think that I have done at least 5!</p></li>
<li><p>Writing things that are not the blog and thesis, do</p>
<p>I wrote some reflections about the reading before blogging yesterday, which somewhat counts, and I’ve done a bit of scheduling for things. I also spent most of the late morning and early afternoon helping my undergrad to write a script to do some data analysis.<a href="#fn0019" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p></li>

<h1 id="reflections-on-the-gospel"><a href="reflections-on-readings-5-lent-c-25.html">Reflections on the Gospel</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2025 April 6</p>
<p>I guess it shouldn’t surprise me that I have only one other reflection on a Lenten gospel, since I’ve never been good at this blog in the springtime.<br />
Note 7 April 2025: By mistake I uploaded the monthly reflection again. Whoops!</p>
<p>N.B. Oof this one got rambly and also weirdly aggressive and uses second person more than usual. To any and all of my readers, I promise that the you in the writing is the generic you, not you specifically.</p>
<h1 id="draft-2-6-april-2025">Draft 2: 6 April 2025</h1>
<p>“Has no one condemned you?”</p>
<p>She replied, “No one, sir.”</p>
<p>Then Jesus said, “Neither do I condemn you. Go, and from now on do not sin any more.”</p>
<p>Of the lines in the Bible, I don’t really know why this one doesn’t get the same sort of, if you’ll pardon the pun, religious fanatacism that others like John 3:16 gets. What better encapsulates Church teaching than Christ’s final line there?</p>
<p>We are a faith of hope, of belief, of love. G-d does not condemn anyone to hell, nor does he condemn anyone generally. We choose hell.</p>
<p>However, this is not free license to act how we please. We are also commanded to sin no further.</p>
<p>Who has the authority to make such statements?</p>
<p>The Lord, the G-d of Abraham and Isaac, the voice of the burning bush, the soft call on the wind.</p>
<p>I cannot understand why the beauty of this line is not commented on more often.</p>
<p>I do, however, understand why so many non-and non-practicing<a href="#fn011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Christians use this as a cudgel. I have primarily seen it used in reference to homosexuality and abortion, the two hot button topics of the era for believers.</p>
<p>When the crowd is gone, and the woman is standing alone in front of her Creator, as we all will do, He asks if anyone condemns her. If she had been wracked with guilt over her actions, she could still have condemned herself. She does not, however. Looking around, and seeing the space empty of herself and Love Himself, she responds that no one does.</p>
<p>While the crowd arrives and ultimately leaves, Christ is writing in the sand. Folk legend says that he was writing the sins of everyone in the crowd, which, even if I do not agree with on principle, points so something we too often forget. In the parables that find themselves recreated in our lives, we are not Him. We are not the father from last week, gladly welcoming his son back. Most often, we are not even the prodigal son. We are the other son, the one feeling jilted because his father is celebrating the return of his wayward son.</p>
<p>I think that we should all take part in a thought exercise. Imagine the worst person who has ever lived. Pray for them.</p>
<p>That’s not the exercise, but it is a good reminder. The exercise works just as well with a fictional person, assuming that you can still bring yourself to feel the same level of disgust and horror at the actions of the person. Imagine that when you die, and the Heavenly Father receives you into his warm embrace, you find yourself face to face with this person. I am not asking how the you of then would feel, I am asking how the you of right now would feel.</p>
<p>Or, take it a few steps closer to home. Think of everyone in your life, repentant sinner trying their best, person flaunting their sin, the annoying person who always takes forever to order their coffee. Would you be happy spending an eternity in heaven with all of them? Would you be happy spending an eternity in heaven if the two of you alone were saved? If the answer to any of these questions is no, then you do not have the heart that Christ demands.</p>
<p>Too often, people who claim to be Christian will speak of justice when they mean retribution. We need to remember, all sin is public sin, because we are all one body. You cannot harm one part of yourself without harming the whole. If, in the gym, one arm gave out before the other, you<a href="#fn012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> would not shame the arm. You would give it the extra attention that it needs in order to be as strong as the other.</p>
<p>The Church does not teach equality, but equity. “To whom much has been given, much is expected”, reminds us that those who have been blessed with more or seemingly greater<a href="#fn013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref3"><sup>3</sup></a> gifts are expected to give more to the world around them. In direct opposition to Calvinism, the Church teaches that those who have received more from the Lord are actively sinful if they notice someone suffering. St. Basil, one of the early Church Fathers<a href="#fn014" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref4"><sup>4</sup></a> put it so strikingly. We would condemn someone stealing the coat from a homeless man’s back. What then, is the coat that we do not wear?</p>
<p>As with every Gospel passage, it can return to love of neighbor. However, this passage is specifically about justice.</p>
<p>One argument people use for retributive “justice” is that it works as a deterrent. If you cut of thieves’ hands, then you will have less theft. If you kill the murderer, others will not lash out in anger. This is not, however, a matter of faith and morals. This is a matter of fact and evidence.</p>
<p>The research is resoundingly clear that retributive justice does not work for anything except causing suffering.<a href="#fn015" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref5"><sup>5</sup></a> All punishment should be oriented towards the salvation of a person’s soul and the souls of all in the world.</p>
<p>An argument for life in prison or capital punishment is that a country may be unable to keep someone effectively detained. If a murderer escapes and kills a dozen people, wouldn’t it have been better to have killed him to prevent that? The Church is incredibly clear on that point.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>The Church rejects any way of quantifying the value of human life, as to put a price on something of infinite glory is to inherently devalue it. We are crafted, lovingly and individually, in the image and likeness of the source of all good. By saying that twenty lives is worth more than a life, or a thousand, or any number, you are inherently saying that there is a worth to human life. One life is worth one life.</p>
<p>Something mathematics has right is the idea of infinity. What is infinity plus one? Or, getting to the direct thrust, what is infinity times twenty, or a million?</p>
<p>Infinity remains infinity.</p>
<p>There is more to be said. One could speak about how jury nullification, at its best, deals with the fact that laws are black and white but circumstances rarely are. One could speak about how we can never know the state of another’s soul. One could speak about how kings had, or at least claimed, a divine right to rule, which gave them the power of choosing death. One could speak about how, if the goal is to cow a populace into not murdering, it is truly less relevant who is hung, as long as a body swings from the rope.</p>
<p>This Lenten season, I invite you and myself to truly think on the meaning of Christ’s passion. He willingly died for each and every one of us and our sins. My sin and my sin alone condemns Christ to the Cross.</p>
<p>But, as Lent becomes Easter, so too does Christ rise from the dead, showing the path forward. We should not condemn those around us, but in all things should strive to love everyone as Christ loves us. After all, just as two infinities is the same as one, half an infinity is as much too. Loving any fraction of the amount that Christ does means having an infinite well of love.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-6-april-2025">Draft 1: 6 April 2025</h1>
<p>Wow, sing of an age past but not forgotten Sunday!<a href="#fn016" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref6"><sup>6</sup></a> It has been ages since the Gospel really spoke to me like it did today. With that in mind, I’m going to reflect on it.</p>
<p>Today’s Gospel is probably one of the more commonly<a href="#fn017" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref7"><sup>7</sup></a> cited passages of the Bible, especially by non believers. In it, a woman is caught in the act of adultery. The crowd,<a href="#fn018" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref8"><sup>8</sup></a> seeing an opportunity to entrap The Lord, ask Him what they should do. Obviously Mosaic Law says that she is to be stoned, but something something, Roman government said that Jews can’t do their own capital punishment or something.</p>
<p>Christ does not respond at first, instead writing<a href="#fn019" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref9"><sup>9</sup></a> on the ground. They repeat he question, and he says that the one without sin should cast the first stone.</p>
<p>In the Catholic joke version of this parable, a stone flies through the air and Christ exclaims “Mom! I told you not to come today!”</p>
<p>In the Biblical<a href="#fn0110" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref10"><sup>10</sup></a> account, the crowd leaves one by one, until it is only the woman and Christ standing there. He asks if any condemn her, and she says no. Christ says that he, then, will also not, and tells her to go forth and sin no further.</p>
<p>Now, there’s a lot that I want to unpack here.</p>
<p>First, something I don’t know if I have ever seen is that Christ implicitly is asking the woman if she condemns herself or her actions. I feel like there’s something really important there, especially in the context of how people use the passage. However, I’m not sure what it is yet, so I’ll try to figure out by the end of this reflection.<a href="#fn0111" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Second, there is a popular Catholic belief that Christ was writing the sins of the crowd on the ground, and that is what caused them to leave. I think that this is a bad faith reading. I do not know a single person who would be able to confidently state that they were perfect and without blame, especially in the context of explicit entrapment. Too, there is the point to remember that they asked Him this to cause trouble. I do not think that they would have stoned her even if He had said that all must follow the Mosaic Law.</p>
<p>In this reading, it is simply a waiting game. At some point, the provocateurs get bored or have other obligations, and are so forced to leave. Christ, waiting patiently<a href="#fn0112" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref12"><sup>12</sup></a>, does not address the woman until the entirety of the crowd leaves. I also don’t know what to make of this, except that we should never make choices about judgement and punishment rashly.</p>
<p>If I had been attempting to goad someone I thought of as a false prophet into choosing between two terrible choices and he just didn’t give a real answer, I think that I would be relatively patient. I surely would believe that he would become uncomfortable with a crowd looming over him, anxiously awaiting an answer, far before I would have reason to leave. I don’t know if that’s true, but, if the leaders had that belief, they would have been proven entirely wrong.</p>
<p>Third,<a href="#fn0113" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref13"><sup>13</sup></a> there is something really interesting to me about the way that the Law is fundamentally changed in that instance. Nothing in the Mosaic Law, so far as I am aware, requires the dispensers of judgement to themselves be pure.</p>
<p>In Catholic teaching, sacraments are effective “ex opere operandi”; the holiness of the one providing the sacrament has no effect on the efficacy of the sacrament. There’s something really interesting to me about the fact that we have decided that expecting perfection from those who have been called and chosen to lead the people of G-d<a href="#fn0114" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref14"><sup>14</sup></a>, and yet Christ seems to be demanding that we be perfect in order to enact justice. Regardless of whether we feel it is merited, the crowd was correct that the explicit punishment laid out in the Law was death by stoning. Again, I don’t know what to do with this thought, so I will leave it for a little as well.</p>
<p>Moving to the more immediately applicable interpreting, this passage is often thrown by non-believers<a href="#fn0115" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref15"><sup>15</sup></a> when Christians attempt to enact policy or seek punishment for violations, especially moral violations. The common response is that Christ said that she was to sin no more, and so telling people to stop bad actions is still ok or something. My most charitable reading of the Christian response is that the Christian legitimately believed that the other person was unaware that they were violating moral law, and out of perfect love and charity were simply informing them of a new Truth.<a href="#fn0116" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Of course, we know that is not the case. Especially in the context of homosexuality, where I feel like the verse was most popularly used, no one is unaware that the standard belief in Christian society has been that homosexuality is inherently sinful.<a href="#fn0117" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref17"><sup>17</sup></a> I think that, truly, this is an example of just how much Christian morality on justice is nonexistent among nominal believers.<a href="#fn0118" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>What is the goal of a punishment? To me, the answer is simple: as with literally everything that we do, the end goal of a punishment should be to bring the entire world to G-d and Christ. What does that mean in this context, though?</p>
<p>Generally, it means that reform based punishments should be seen as objectively better than retribution based punishment.<a href="#fn0119" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The Church, in “Fides et Ratio”, was very clear that religious and scientific truth do not disagree. The idea that anyone has the right to end another’s life, whether explicitly by capital punishment or implicitly by life sentences, comes from the belief that Church Fathers had that deterrence was an effective way to reduce crime.</p>
<p>That is not a question of faith and morals.</p>
<p>Deterrence’s effect on crime rates lies exactly in the camp of a question that rational<a href="#fn0120" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref20"><sup>20</sup></a> thought can answer. Even the federal government, whose recent administration is explicitly in favor of retribution based punishment, <a href="https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/five-things-about-deterrence">still acknowledges that harsh punishments do not reduce crime.</a> So, then, how can a Catholic support retribution based punishment?</p>
<p>This is not a rhetorical question, for all that its presence in my writing makes it inherently rhetorical.<a href="#fn0121" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref21"><sup>21</sup></a> I legitimately do not know of an argument for retribution based punishment that does not rely on the argument of “the Church Fathers said it was ok.” The Church Fathers are often wrong. Aquinas, the argumentative Catholic’s favorite cudgel, famously did not believe in the immaculate conception. We don’t question the validity of this.</p>
<p>We don’t<a href="#fn0122" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref22"><sup>22</sup></a> question that daytime is bright because of the sun, as Augustine did. So then why is it that we question the Holy Father, who, seeing this, recently reminded all Catholics that we cannot support the death penalty. I have seen that some say that we still should allow it because we may not be able to keep someone imprisoned. Why is someone being imprisoned?</p>
<p>In the Christian ethical framework, we are punished only in so far as it is beneficial towards leading us to the Gospel. If we believe that crime is bad for getting all souls to heaven<a href="#fn0123" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref23"><sup>23</sup></a>, then we should work to stop crime in whatever way is most effective. The data show that means catching people, and giving them ways to rehabilitate.</p>
<p>If a murderer escapes custody and kills again, this is not somehow worse than killing them. If a murderer escapes and kills a thousand people, it is still no worse than killing them. All lives are infinitely precious.</p>
<p>Despite what we may have thought as children, infinity times one thousand is still infinity.</p>
<p>Of course, this line of thought quickly leads to pure pacifism.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I now have a meeting with a friend, and so cannot finish the thought. That’s probably fine, since I am on a huge tangent right now.</p>
<h1 id="daily-reflection-6-april-2025">Daily Reflection: 6 April 2025)</h1>
<p>I’m realizing that the way that these goals is structured is not entirely what I want right now. It kind of came up in yesterday’s musing, but, while I don’t think that today is going to be the day that I work to fix it<a href="#fn0124" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref24"><sup>24</sup></a>, I think that it’s still probably worth thinking about. Right now I’m kind of leaning towards obligations<a href="#fn0125" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref25"><sup>25</sup></a>, growth, both autotelic<a href="#fn0126" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref26"><sup>26</sup></a> and means<a href="#fn0127" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref27"><sup>27</sup></a>, and how to improve in some other regard.<a href="#fn0128" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>Anyways</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Intentionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At least hourly, stand up, drink water, take two deep breaths, and do a stretch of some sort</p>
<p>Absolutely did not do this yesterday. I was writing for a solid four hours and stood maybe three times, with absolutely no stretching. That being said, though, I do think that I was much better about drinking water yesterday, which is really good! Unfortunately, my bottle is just barely too low to drink from with good posture with my current desk layout.<a href="#fn0129" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Be proactive about avoiding overwhelm and when feeling overwhelmed, stop and figure out why.</p>
<p>Generally doing ok! I do find that I’m getting migraines more often, so it might be worthwhile to just start taking caffeine in the morning with the rest of my pills.</p></li>
<li><p>Light a candle and read by candlelight each night. Along with this, leave all electronics outside of the bedroom and/or move them away at least an hour before bed time.</p>
<p>I lit the candle but did not do candlelight or electronics free.</p></li>
<li><p>Candle time in the morning before electronics. Use the time for prayer</p>
<p>See above.</p></li>
<li><p>Focus on good posture, especially straight back and making sure that neck isn’t awkwardly positioned.</p>
<p>Did decently during choir retreat, realized why so many doctors hate laptops while working yesterday.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t waste time, and in particular, be mindful about making sure to take breaks and rest. Especially make sure to do rest which revitalizes the me of tomorrow, rather than rest which simply keeps me in stasis.</p>
<p>Eh. I think that I was generally ok with the revitalizing aspect, because I feel well rested. Then again, I also slept in effectively two more hours today. I have to decide between feeling rested and feeling tired at night’s end, I think. If I just force my way through this week, hopefully I can reset the schedule?</p></li>
<li><p>Interpersonal Relationships:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Figure out what belongs in a normal letter to a friend.</p>
<p>Darn libraries being closed on the weekend.</p></li>
<li><p>Get back into writing letters.</p>
<p>I woke up to a message from a friend today asking if I was still willing and able to help with a project today. Since my general rule of thumb is that in person events almost always trump unexpected things to a friend,<a href="#fn0130" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref30"><sup>30</sup></a> I agreed. That does mean I don’t have a super free day, though.</p></li>
<li><p>Work to message friends at desired intervals.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Professional:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Do the Thesis and other research requirements. Upcoming deadlines:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Brain dump about science communication (Overdue)</p></li>
<li><p>Brain dump a publicly accessible chapter (Overdue)</p></li>
<li><p>Have final convergences for the results I’m trying to reproduce (due 4/4)</p></li>
<li><p>Draft of the first paper (due end of month, but I want to make sure that I’ve reupdated it sooner than later)</p></li>
<li><p>Finish revising and editing the overview of a program chapter (due 4/7) and send it to the boss</p></li>
<li><p>Revise the Science communication and publicly readable chapters (due 4/7)</p></li>
<li><p>Send the science communication chapter to the boss (4/14)</p></li>
<li><p>Brain Dump the background to the program (4/14)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Only do the work I feel called to when I’ve finished the tasks set to me for the day or outside of normal working hours (post 1725)</p></li>
<li><p>Start making the giant citation document so that I don’t have to search for citations later.</p></li>
<li><p>Work towards future career:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Figure out the difference between my public-facing and field-facing presentation affects. As I focus on becoming a better presenter, I need to become aware of the difference and how to switch them.</p></li>
<li><p>Need to look for jobs</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Health:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Spiritual:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Get back into the Lenten goals (pray chaplet of St. Michael, give money equal to amount I’m spending on myself, stop scrolling social media, stop playing video games)</p></li>
<li><p>Be intentional about prayer. That means both making time for prayer and actually doing it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Physical:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start focusing on posture again, especially while sitting.</p></li>
<li><p>Go to group fitness classes more regularly and more often. If not, do workout at home</p></li>
<li><p>Feed myself simply and healthily. Healthy here means trying to generally avoid processing.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Mental:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clean Life:</p></li>
<li><p>Remove dirt and clutter from physical spaces (standard definition of clean):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At least once a week, each room has nothing on the floor</p></li>
<li><p>At least once a week, all surfaces which are not inherently storage are cleared off</p></li>
<li><p>At least once every two weeks, each room is vacuumed</p></li>
<li><p>At least once every month, all non-storage surfaces are explicitly washed/cleaned</p></li>
<li><p>At least once a week, I get rid of at least one item that I notice (meaning throw away or in rare circumstances gift or donate)</p></li>
<li><p>Clean sight lines. Is my space set up in a way that orients me towards my goals for the space? If not, how can I make it so?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Spend time each day thinking about the goals for the day, and getting them out of my head and onto the page.</p></li>
<li><p>Continue to explicitly confront the voice in my head that says that people hate me.</p></li>
</ul></li>

<h1 id="on-feeding-myself"><a href="feeding-myself.html">On Feeding Myself</a></h1>
<p>First Published 5 April 2025</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-5-april-2025">Draft 1: 5 April 2025</h1>
<p>A potentially concerning percentage of the posts<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> I’ve been writing are about food. I want to be feeding myself, and I want that feeding to go quickly and healthily.</p>
<p>I did realize today, though, that I want this post to encompass more than simply feeding my stomach. I want to make sure that all parts of me, body, mind, and soul, are being fed. Still, I’m going to start with feeding the body.</p>
<p>Breakfast and lunch, at least during the work week, are getting better and better. Breakfast of oats with berries is a great breakfast,<a href="#fn022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and I’ve generally been eating a decent lunch. Dinner remains a mixed bag, though, which isn’t great.</p>
<p>I think that there are a few interwoven parts to that. For one, I still have some part of me that really thinks that dinner should be a production, or at least something effortful. I don’t really know what that means, and interrogating the idea isn’t really giving me anything either. However, I guess it is good for me to know that I have that gut instinct, so that I can start confronting it. I think that the other main issue with dinner is that I do not have a schedule, which makes scheduling exactly when I will be eating what in my home more difficult.</p>
<p>Still, I’ve done any number of hard things, and this isn’t as hard as that.</p>
<p>Third issue is that I don’t have a microwave, so anything I want for dinner kind of has to be stove or oven meal, which also adds some time to the prep.</p>
<p>Potential solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Plan to eat dinner at work. In this way I feed myself, don’t crash as much when I stay late, have motivation to stay and keep working, and have access to a microwave. Downsides: I then am eating all three of my daily meals at work, it does nothing to help my weekend self, and I only have access to a microwave.<a href="#fn023" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref3"><sup>3</sup></a> I guess I really mean that I cannot do food prep at the office the same way that I can at home. It would require me constructing meals and bringing them to the office.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep as I am doing. Works for lunch and breakfast, but adds stress to my day and means I’m very tired by the time that I go home for the night. Probably not the winner, for all that it does have the advantage of being exactly what I currently do.</p></li>
<li><p>Do to dinner what I do to lunch: premake a bunch of meals and then heat one up each night. This can work with the first idea, but it means that if I do so at home, I have to deal with the slow pace of oven or stove.</p></li>
<li><p>Make dinner the night before, when I would have been making the dinner for night of. In this way, I can still get the cooking itch scratched, and if I don’t prep something, then I will know that I am responsible for feeding myself.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I guess there’s also the tertiary consideration, which is that I can also just keep more easily consumed food at home. If I do that, then I can just grab like a handful of peanuts when I feel hungry, rather than needing to either just suffer or make something effortful.</p>
<p>Ok with my thoughts laid out like this, I think that I have my answer for now. Night before, I will cook dinner for the following day. If, for whatever reason, I am not able to get the meal done, then I’ll just grab two lunches to work, and eat one for dinner.<a href="#fn024" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>I’ll also get some peanuts the next time I go shopping and then have a snack that I can consume at home. Goal part two of feeding my body is explicitly getting some, if not recipes, then at least food things that I can do, knowing that a past me has found their macro profiles to at least resemble something decent.</p>
<p>(N.B. I wrote everything from here until the start of the list after the second entry, because I realized that I want to do the back of the envelope protein content for what I’m getting from breakfast and lunch).</p>
<p>Assuming that I eat my oats and box lunch like a good child, I should be getting about<a href="#fn025" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref5"><sup>5</sup></a> my entire daily need for protein in the first two meals I eat, so I can go entirely based on vibes!</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Pot of beans has been doing me well. If I thought ahead, I could do from dry<a href="#fn026" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref6"><sup>6</sup></a>, and I know that I prefer them with a little kick.<a href="#fn027" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Beans are great in terms of the macros. I’ve taken to starting with frying up a handful of frozen onion and celery, which adds at least something to the dish, and I also tend to pour in some frozen peas at the end, which helps the dish overall. It’s also relatively low effort, which means that if I make a batch<a href="#fn028" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref8"><sup>8</sup></a> I will need to actually eat the whole batch before the beans ferment.<a href="#fn029" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref9"><sup>9</sup></a> I don’t really need rice with that, though rice is nice. Probably worth thinking about making up some rice at start of week and doing some portioning? Ooh! If I get japanese curry blocks, I can have curry beans and rice.<a href="#fn0210" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref10"><sup>10</sup></a>.</p>
<p>“But!” you might cry out here, “is a curry block not incredibly processed?”</p>
<p>Great question.</p></li>
<li><p>if I thinly slice meat, rather than boldly chunk it as I have been, I can take small bits of that and it’ll reheat quickly.<a href="#fn0211" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Since I don’t really need to hit any macro goals, plain curry rice<a href="#fn0212" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref12"><sup>12</sup></a> is an easy and tasty option. If I add vegetables to the curry, becomes even healthier! I can also apparently make my own curry block at home!<a href="#fn0213" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref13"><sup>13</sup></a> My friend recommended carrot, potato, and onion as a trio of vegetables for the curry. I guess one issue is that I then have to cook them and make the roux, which kind of means that it shouldn’t be a daily event. Honestly, though, that’s not a huge issue. I don’t think I actually have the cooking urge so much as have tied it in my mind to being able to eat dinner<a href="#fn0214" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Ok cool, I do love japanese curry, and I have been wanting an excuse to buy potatoes.<a href="#fn0215" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref15"><sup>15</sup></a> So, the to do list is:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clean out fridge<a href="#fn0216" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Figure out food cooking timings (next part of blog)</p></li>
<li><p>Figure out how often I need to go grocery shopping to get the things that I want to have</p></li>
<li><p>Get the things for next week</p></li>
<li><p>Make food</p></li>
<li><p>Keep a schedule</p></li>
</ul>
<p>One thing that I know about myself is that I cannot rely on weekends for cooking. I can rely on it for shopping, which is maybe strange, but. I guess there’s also the fact that I will have an incredibly different schedule in a little over a month<a href="#fn0217" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref17"><sup>17</sup></a>, and will be visiting friends<a href="#fn0218" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref18"><sup>18</sup></a> over the summer, so I guess I know that it won’t be a forever thing. Still, probably good to give myself the bare bones of how I would feed myself going forward.</p>
<p>So:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I eat a small loaf of bread each day M T R.<a href="#fn0219" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref19"><sup>19</sup></a> If I make the buns as I have been, I can make 24 at once. Let’s say that’s three or four loaves a week, which means I need to make bread every six to eight weeks. That feels about true to what I’ve had, and of course does not include the fact that I do tend to eat more than a loaf on some days or eat them on off days. Cool, once I figure out how many I have left, I can schedule when to make the next batch.</p>
<p>Oh! I did also just buy a lighter whole wheat flour, because I don’t necessarily have to eat the aggressive winter wheat, spring wheat is also still whole. That’ll be fun. I do also want to start using the entire container of yogurt, because I have kind of stopped eating it at home lately. That might change with my schedule, but I doubt it.</p></li>
<li><p>I currently don’t eat meat on Fridays because it’s Lent<a href="#fn0220" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref20"><sup>20</sup></a>. I should consider whether it’s worth continuing that past lent. Pros: day without meat is better for the environment and myself, if the data are to be trusted. The American Church is laxer than most of the world when it comes to the Friday meat restriction. Technically we are still supposed to give it up. I’m on a high meat diet<a href="#fn0221" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref21"><sup>21</sup></a> right now entirely because I want to make sure that I’m not harming my body. If I keep not eating meat on Fridays, I will in theory start to get more meals that are meatless and can find ways to increase protein.<a href="#fn0222" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref22"><sup>22</sup></a> I don’t know what I started this note with, but that’s just a thing to consider.</p></li>
<li><p>I eat about 100 grams of cheese every day I have a bun, so approximately 3-4 times a week. I must be buying huge blocks of cheese, because wow I get a lot of days’ cheese from them. Still, next time I’m at the store, note how many it will make.</p></li>
<li><p>Around 200 grams of pork a day of cheese, which means a little more than two weeks a kilo. Since I think that the porks I’ve bought are all in the 8-10 pound range, that means I’m good for probably a month per pork.<a href="#fn0223" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Fruit: one to three a lunch, on all days ideally. That means that I need at least fifteen a week. I also find that they’re only really good for a week or two. With that in mind, I guess that I should probably be buying a weekly supply. I don’t know if driving an hour a week is necessarily worth it to go to Costco, but maybe it is, especially when I’m going somewhere nearby already.</p></li>
<li><p>Vegetable: I have been loving crunching down on a romaine heart, but I think that literally anything which has that same general vibe<a href="#fn0224" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref24"><sup>24</sup></a> would be good enough. Also probably an every 1-2 week thing.<a href="#fn0225" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Ok cool, that’s everything I eat I think? Oats and frozen fruit I of course need to buy as I run low, but they last forever, and so don’t need to be considered in terms of perishables.</p>
<p>So, I’m going to be making Japanese inspired curry on Tuesday.<a href="#fn0226" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Oh wait, I do also want to get through my beans.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>Ok so for now let’s try curry beans and rice, as much as that’s not really a thing. I’m still going to be doing potato, carrot, and onion, since those are all delicious and my heritage yearns for me to eat more potato. This means my shopping list is carrot<a href="#fn0227" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref27"><sup>27</sup></a>, onion<a href="#fn0228" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref28"><sup>28</sup></a>, potato, curry block, fruit<a href="#fn0229" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref29"><sup>29</sup></a>, and crunchy green<a href="#fn0230" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref30"><sup>30</sup></a>.</p>
<p>I’ll also inventory my fridge and freezer and toss the expired and rotten food.<a href="#fn0231" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref31"><sup>31</sup></a> What food is not expired, I will also attempt to eat quickly, in such a way as to get rid of it.</p>
<p>Great!</p>
<p>Now, about feeding the rest of me.</p>
<p>I want to get back into typing practice I think. Two of the rate limiting factors for me right now are legitimately my typing speed and accuracy. That feeds three things: the part of me that loves quantifying growth, the part of me that is writing a bunch, and the part of me that likes being good at things.<a href="#fn0232" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref32"><sup>32</sup></a> On weekdays, I think that this will mean that I spend the five minutes immediately after daily reflection doing typing practice. Goal in that space is of course accuracy and correct finger placement.<a href="#fn0233" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Actually, if I start with the practice, then I will be primed to get the finger choices and placements correct, so five minutes before doing the reflection are to be spent on the practice.</p>
<p>What else am I trying to feed?</p>
<p>I absolutely need to do guitar every day and work out every day. A forty minute workout in the morning is a lot, but forty minutes is forty minutes, and I’m no longer finding that I am only productive in the morning. If anything, it kind of feels like I’m having the waking version of the previous me’s experience with alarms.<a href="#fn0234" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>Five minutes of stretching at night and five minutes of guitar in morning and evening means that in total I’m scheduling less than an hour of my life right now. I’m debating whether or not I should let myself catch up on content during the morning stretch, but am leaning towards no. I’ll absolutely get more workouts in if I only let myself catch up on content when being stretching or cleaning, especially because I do want to keep up with content.</p>
<p>I want to read more. If I just say that I’ll read each night, will I? One issue is that I very much cannot read or write by candlelight, at least with it as flickery as it is. Apparently trimming the wick can help with that.<a href="#fn0235" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref35"><sup>35</sup></a> I think that I will! But, I also don’t want my nights to be filled with a number of activities, even if they are nominally restful. I think that reading analog nonfiction will help me to bed, as will writing poetry.</p>
<p>As the end to the previous sentence implies, I also want to write more poetry. Doing so after reading might actually be the best, because it gives me a space to process what I read and get my final thoughts for the day onto the page.</p>
<p>Woo! Look at this, I have plans for how I will feed myself. Now I just have to actually go to the store, get the food, clean the fridge, make the food, and keep to the schedule. Basically nothing!</p>
<h1 id="draft-0.5-4-april-2025">Draft 0.5: 4 April 2025</h1>
<p>I’ve mused more than a few times about how I would like to improve my mental and physical health, especially in context of food. In the past, I’ve focused more on the higher level concerns, like the overall macro and micronutrient profiles that I should aim for. The other posts have generally been focused on individual recipes that I made a single time, mostly so that I would have a point of reference in the future when I forgot what I did. However, the most important part of keeping myself eating healithily is actually having a sustainable way of feeding myself. With that in mind, this post is focused on how I’m getting nutrients now, how I’d like to be, how I think that I should be, and what the differences are.</p>
<p>So, let’s start with what I’m doing right now.</p>
<p>My breakfast for weekdays is a bowl of oatmeal with frozen<a href="#fn0236" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref36"><sup>36</sup></a> berries, usually blueberries but sometimes mixed berries. These days, my lunch on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday are a block of pork<a href="#fn0237" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref37"><sup>37</sup></a> and cheese<a href="#fn0238" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref38"><sup>38</sup></a>, along with a romaine heart and one or two apples or pears, depending on what I got at the store that week. Dinner, on the other hand, has no regularity</p>
<h1 id="daily-reflection-4-april-2025">Daily Reflection: 4 April 2025)</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Intentionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At least hourly, stand up, drink water, take two deep breaths, and do a stretch of some sort</p>
<p>I know that I did a bad job of this, but I also realized that I had 20 minutes of break between 11am and 8:15pm yesterday, and that’s not including the fact that I was actively working before 11. Still, the idea of self work and externalized schedules are different.</p></li>
<li><p>Be proactive about avoiding overwhelm and when feeling overwhelmed, stop and figure out why.</p>
<p>Despite that, I somehow did not feel too overwhelmed yesterday. That was great.</p></li>
<li><p>Light a candle and read by candlelight each night. Along with this, leave all electronics outside of the bedroom and/or move them away at least an hour before bed time.</p>
<p>Candle time is really nice. It remains a pain to write by flickering candle light, but it might be good if I were to get some sort of lid like in a lantern. No electronics was great too.</p></li>
<li><p>Candle time in the morning before electronics. Use the time for prayer</p>
<p>Did not have candle time, but I did force myself to make time to stretch and pray before getting onto electronics. That was probably good.</p></li>
<li><p>Focus on good posture, especially straight back and making sure that neck isn’t awkwardly positioned.</p>
<p>Good posture is getting easier, and I can now bring my shoulders too far back for even posture.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t waste time, and in particular, be mindful about making sure to take breaks and rest. Especially make sure to do rest which revitalizes the me of tomorrow, rather than rest which simply keeps me in stasis.</p>
<p>I think that I did ok with this, though prioritizing remains incredibly difficult. I don’t know what’s more important between the writing I know I need to do for work, the writing I know I need to do for my personal well being, the derivations I need to be doing for my code, the code I need to work on, the things I must do in order to be healthy in all the senses of the word, the things that people expect of me, and the things that no one is asking me to do that I don’t want to do but absolutely need to do.<a href="#fn0239" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Interpersonal Relationships:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Figure out what belongs in a normal letter to a friend.</p>
<p>The books arrived at the library, so now it’s time for me to pick them up. That’s going to be fun</p></li>
<li><p>Get back into writing letters.</p>
<p>I think that this is always meant to be a weekend thing.</p></li>

</ul></li>
<li><p>Only do the work I feel called to when I’ve finished the tasks set to me for the day or outside of normal working hours (post 1725)</p>
<p>It’s unclear to me what’s work I want to do and what is work that I need to be doing.</p></li>
<li><p>Start making the giant citation document so that I don’t have to search for citations later.</p>
<p>Nothing new, but I’ve at least reorganized the books I have which are at least nominally related to the research.</p></li>
<li><p>Work towards future career:</p>
<ul>

<li><p>Need to look for jobs</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Health:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Spiritual:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Get back into the Lenten goals (pray chaplet of St. Michael, give money equal to amount I’m spending on myself, stop scrolling social media, stop playing video games)</p></li>
<li><p>Be intentional about prayer. That means both making time for prayer and actually doing it.</p>
<p>I prayed the chaplet this morning! I haven’t been scrolling or gaming, which is good. I have yet to get into the almsgiving, which is a shame.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Physical:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start focusing on posture again, especially while sitting.</p>
<p>Did that yesterday, today I am in pain and not sure why. I will still work on posture, but it is a lower priority.</p></li>
<li><p>Go to group fitness classes more regularly and more often. If not, do workout at home.</p>
<p>Did a workout yesterday night, despite getting home late. Stretched this morning because I have the full knowledge that I am not getting home until very very late.</p></li>
<li><p>Feed myself simply and healthily. Healthy here means trying to generally avoid processing.</p>
<p>I don’t generally think of canned food as unprocessed, but realistically it’s a pretty low level processing.</p></li>

<li><p>Mental:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clean Life:</p></li>
<li><p>Remove dirt and clutter from physical spaces (standard definition of clean):</p>

<li><p>At least once every month, all non-storage surfaces are explicitly washed/cleaned</p></li>
<li><p>At least once a week, I get rid of at least one item that I notice (meaning throw away or in rare circumstances gift or donate)</p></li>
<li><p>Clean sight lines. Is my space set up in a way that orients me towards my goals for the space? If not, how can I make it so?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Spend time each day thinking about the goals for the day, and getting them out of my head and onto the page.</p>
<p>Wow look at this.</p></li>
<li><p>Continue to explicitly confront the voice in my head that says that people hate me.</p>
<p>Woo.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reading</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start reading and returning the library books I have.</p>
<p>I just reorganized the shelf, and there are far fewer books than I thought that there were. That’s pretty great, which means that I have more hope about my abilities to rewrite.</p></li>
<li><p>Finish the book on mindfulness I started. (also make a list of the exercises in the book and try them out)</p>
<p>Did no reading yesterday, which I don’t love, but I was also very tired.<a href="#fn0240" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p></li>

<li><p>Write poetry more often, ideally nightly.</p>
<p>Wrote some last night, and even tried to work with meter and rhyme, at least a little bit.</p></li>
<li><p>Find a way to add meta data to my blog posts and then add the meta data</p>
<p>Is metadata all one word? I think that it might actually be. Asked my sysadmin about it.</p></li>

<h1 id="daily-reflection-5-april-2025">Daily Reflection: 5 April 2025)</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Intentionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At least hourly, stand up, drink water, take two deep breaths, and do a stretch of some sort.</p>
<p>If the fact that that I didn’t end up posting last night isn’t enough of an indication, I did not, in fact, manage to do this. Additionally, I don’t think that I drank water or had good posture for most hours. From 1300 to 1900 I was completely locked in.<a href="#fn0241" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Be proactive about avoiding overwhelm and when feeling overwhelmed, stop and figure out why.</p>
<p>I think I did ok with this. Didn’t feel very overwhelmed for most of the day yesterday, and so that was good. Today, because I was double booked, I ended up feeling overwhelmed when I got to the second activity, which was fine. I took literally 30 seconds, wrote down what I was thinking, and then felt better.</p></li>
<li><p>Light a candle and read by candlelight each night. Along with this, leave all electronics outside of the bedroom and/or move them away at least an hour before bed time. I didn’t get home until very late last night, and so I did not do this.</p></li>
<li><p>Candle time in the morning before electronics. Use the time for prayer I also did not do this. Oof</p></li>
<li><p>Focus on good posture, especially straight back and making sure that neck isn’t awkwardly positioned.</p>
<p>Forgot about this for most of the day, and then was reminded by looking at others, and so I am once again reminding myself that posture is important.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t waste time, and in particular, be mindful about making sure to take breaks and rest. Especially make sure to do rest which revitalizes the me of tomorrow, rather than rest which simply keeps me in stasis.</p>
<p>I think that I generally did ok with this. I spent last night hanging out with some friends, and it was great to see them, even if it did mean that I was out far later than I would otherwise normally choose.</p></li>
<li><p>Interpersonal Relationships:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Figure out what belongs in a normal letter to a friend.</p>
<p>Shoot, in the fugue/flow<a href="#fn0242" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref42"><sup>42</sup></a> of yesterday afternoon I did not end up picking up the books.</p></li>
<li><p>Get back into writing letters.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is Sunday, and so tomorrow a letter is to be written.<a href="#fn0243" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Work to message friends at desired intervals.</p>
<p>I still need to make the list, but I do feel like I’m doing an ok job of contacting some friends. List really needs to start moving up the priority list. It’s just hard because, while I adore and feel close and want to remain close with a number of people, I also feel like I am already so far behind on my thesis writing.<a href="#fn0244" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref44"><sup>44</sup></a> I have some objective standards for that, since I do, in fact, have a draft due nominally on Monday that I haven’t even finished writing, let alone leaving for a week before revising and another week before editing to send it in. However, I will always be behind, and I need to start to come to terms with that.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Professional:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Do the Thesis and other research requirements. Upcoming deadlines:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Brain dump about science communication (Overdue)</p>
<p>On the bright side, I had the event today, so I can at least write about how it went in the form of a laboratory report. It’s almost certainly not worth publishing, but that’s why it gets to go in the thesis. If I start reading the books on teaching astronomy and chemistry that I have in my shelf, I can write something about that, if only as a “this could be a cool experiment for someone to use”</p></li>
<li><p>Brain dump a publicly accessible chapter (Overdue)</p>
<p>I’ve been trying to explain my research to people more and more, and it’s hard because one answer is “I’m writing AI to replace the work of assigning molecular spectra”, which is in the broadest terms true, but that’s really the only terms where it’s true. Anything else, though, requires me to explain what rotational spectroscopy is.</p></li>
<li><p>Have final convergences for the results I’m trying to reproduce (Overdue)</p>
<p>I figured out<a href="#fn0245" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref45"><sup>45</sup></a> why the code wasn’t converging correctly, and spent some time yesterday with the derivations trying to make the speed up I had plausible. However, I should instead just finish updating the code to run with both ideas that I have.<a href="#fn0246" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref46"><sup>46</sup></a> I started before the activity this morning, so that was good, but I also need to clean the code and delete the extraneous code<a href="#fn0247" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Draft of the first paper (due end of month, but I want to make sure that I’ve reupdated it sooner than later)</p>
<p>I looked at it today, because I deleted the actual file which had my compiled comparisons between theory and experiment at some point. I knew that it was in the file, then realized that one benefit of cookies is that the site I haven’t been to in at least 8 months still had the entire spreadsheet in the different forms I might want it to be expressed. That is literally all that I did, though.</p></li>
<li><p>Finish revising and editing the overview of a program chapter (due 4/7) and send it to the boss</p>
<p>This really means finish writing. However, since I can’t really distinguish between the background and the overview, I think that it might have to get broken into different sections. I don’t know how, but what’s most important is getting all the content on the page, both for the words and so that I don’t have to remember to add more content. I can’t revise an empty page and all</p></li>
<li><p>Revise the Science communication and publicly readable chapters (due 4/7)</p></li>
<li><p>Send the science communication chapter to the boss (4/14)</p></li>
<li><p>Brain Dump the background to the program (4/14)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Only do the work I feel called to when I’ve finished the tasks set to me for the day or outside of normal working hours (post 1725)</p>
<p>So, yesterday was not a good example of that. I did have it in the to do list, but that isn’t really so much a reason as an excuse.</p></li>
<li><p>Start making the giant citation document so that I don’t have to search for citations later.</p>
<p>I reorganized my bookshelf, so the books that I am most likely to put in my thesis are all in the same place now.</p></li>
<li><p>Work towards future career:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Figure out the difference between my public-facing and field-facing presentation affects. As I focus on becoming a better presenter, I need to become aware of the difference and how to switch them.</p></li>
<li><p>Need to look for jobs</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Health:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Spiritual:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Get back into the Lenten goals (pray chaplet of St. Michael, give money equal to amount I’m spending on myself, stop scrolling social media, stop playing video games)</p></li>
<li><p>Be intentional about prayer. That means both making time for prayer and actually doing it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Physical:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start focusing on posture again, especially while sitting.</p>
<p>I don’t know if I’m doing something wrong but wow is sitting up straight kinking my shoulder something fierce.</p></li>
<li><p>Go to group fitness classes more regularly and more often. If not, do workout at home</p>
<p>Haven’t worked out yet today, but am planning to when I get home.<a href="#fn0248" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Feed myself simply and healthily. Healthy here means trying to generally avoid processing.</p>
<p>Ehhhh, most of my food since the last reflection was potluck style. I don’t believe in mandating someone else’s diet, especially when they are helping to feed me.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Mental:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clean Life:</p></li>
<li><p>Remove dirt and clutter from physical spaces (standard definition of clean):</p>
<p>It took me all morning yesterday, but the area above my desk is again ordered, and significantly moreso<a href="#fn0249" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref49"><sup>49</sup></a> than it was before. My home,<a href="#fn0250" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref50"><sup>50</sup></a> however, is in a static or slightly worsened state. At some point I’ll have to take the time and commit to actually just giving a day to a deep clean, but that day is not today.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At least once a week, each room has nothing on the floor</p></li>
<li><p>At least once a week, all surfaces which are not inherently storage are cleared off</p></li>
<li><p>At least once every two weeks, each room is vacuumed</p></li>
<li><p>At least once every month, all non-storage surfaces are explicitly washed/cleaned</p></li>
<li><p>At least once a week, I get rid of at least one item that I notice (meaning throw away or in rare circumstances gift or donate)</p></li>
<li><p>Clean sight lines. Is my space set up in a way that orients me towards my goals for the space? If not, how can I make it so?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Spend time each day thinking about the goals for the day, and getting them out of my head and onto the page.</p>
<p>I really need to start the day with this more explicitly. I don’t know what medium to use, though, because I don’t want to be on the computer early, but I do also primarily look at the computer, these days.<a href="#fn0251" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Continue to explicitly confront the voice in my head that says that people hate me.</p>
<p>Spent time with friends last night, and I didn’t even think that they hated me once before leaving!</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reading</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start reading and returning the library books I have.</p>
<p>They’re organized now, into the four relevant kinds.<a href="#fn0252" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Finish the book on mindfulness I started. (also make a list of the exercises in the book and try them out)</p>
<p>Have made no progress. I will do so tonight, though.</p></li>
<li><p>Read more poetry</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Music:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Work on guitar</p>
<p>Oof. I haven’t touched it in days.<a href="#fn0253" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Learn the songs that jam partner suggested and/or requested I learn</p></li>
<li><p>Get back into the album.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Write poetry more often, ideally nightly.</p></li>
<li><p>Find a way to add meta data to my blog posts and then add the meta data</p></li>
<li><p>Not only write blogs, but also post them.</p>
<p>I didn’t do either tomorrow, which isn’t great.</p></li>
<li><p>Get back into writing the web novel</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Other hobbies, do them.</p></li>

Still, I think I probably eat 2-4 ounces of oats a day, so 10 to 20 grams of protein. Probably about 50 grams from the 200 grams of pork I’m now eating a day (I was still hungy after eating the 100 gram bits, so). I’ll assume the cheese that I’m eating right now is fairly representative, and so I’m getting like 25 grams from that. Oh Wild, I don’t actually need protein at dinner!

<h1 id="time-discounts-and-a-better-me"><a href="time-discounts.html">Time Discounts and a Better Me</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2025 April 3</p>
<h1 id="draft-3-3-april-2025">Draft 3: 3 April 2025</h1>
<p>Anything in the future is worth less than having it now. For all that the previous sentence feels like the rantings of a child, they really underpin a lot of modern economic thought.<a href="#fn031" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> In economic terms, most everything either appreciates or depreciates, and most do so in some sort of exponential fashion.</p>
<p>In retirement advice, this is usually used as a way to encourage 20 and 30 somethings to enjoy their lives a little less.<a href="#fn032" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In this post, however, I’m going to use it as the way of encouraging me to become slightly better.</p>
<p>I think that I can improve as a person. Even though I do agree that the exponential growth implied by most basic theories of compounding are unrealistic or unsustainable<a href="#fn033" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, there is still something to be said for compounding generally. Every day that I go forth with a skill is a day that I can improve the lives of those around me through that skill. Since I live in a society with capital requirements, I also have a chance to use any skill for a profit.</p>
<p>It’s far more than that, though.</p>
<p>There’s an old interview my grandmother once had, where she debated someone about whether or not everyone should get a liberal arts degree. As you might expect from everything about me, she argued very much in favor of universal liberal arts education. In her mind, and as a partial consequence, my mind, education is an inherently positive thing.<a href="#fn034" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref4"><sup>4</sup></a> We are changed by everything we experience, and education helps any such change to be positive. When we learn facts, we are able to connect events and realities. When we learn theories and heuristics, we are better able to make sense of the world. And, more than anything, I think that learning is about finding joy in the world.</p>
<p>The Almighty created the heavens and the earth for humanity.<a href="#fn035" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref5"><sup>5</sup></a> We are called to seek the Divine, and are given the wonder of the universe to better understand Divinity. We are given talents and seeds for growth and asked to plant and nurture them in ourselves and others.</p>
<p>Through all of this, there’s something to be said for laying groundwork today for a better tomorrow.</p>
<p>The nearer term the future and the greater the expectation of gains, the more I should be willing to give now. That feels reasonable. If spending two hours on a project makes me feel marginally better for the following hour, I’m not sure if it’s worth it. If spending two hours is supposed to me feel marginally better for an hour in three weeks, I know that it’s not.</p>
<p>There’s also the cost to be considered. Something that takes minimal effort is worth doing, even if the expected gain is low. I know that after stretching I feel better in the moments to follow, the rest of the day, and the following days. I even tend to feel better during it.</p>
<p>The initial premise of this post was self improvement. What can I do to make myself better, and how much is bettering myself worth?</p>
<p>I’m reading a book right now called <em>Radical Acceptance</em>, and one of its key points is that only after accepting the realities of ourselves can we change any of them. The author is pretty clear that the goal is not attempting to change things, but I can take from books what I want. Still, there’s a large difference between accepting reality and settling for reality.</p>
<p>How do I want to improve? Let’s spend a minute and think.</p>
<p>I want to be more productive. I want to be more in shape. I want to be more kind to myself and others. I want to learn how to be vulnerable. I want to write, just so very very many words for my thesis. I want to experience the world around me, highs and lows.</p>
<p>Wow that went all over the place.</p>
<p>Ok so, writing and being productive obviously go hand in hand, since the productivity I’m searching for is generally writing right now.<a href="#fn036" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Being in shape is probably not a great goal as an end in itself, and wanting to be in shape for how I look is also not a good goal, since bodies change and I should never strive for a bodily ideal that absolutely is not sustainable for the rest of my life. I do, however, want to be able to experience the world around me.</p>
<p>When a friend asks if I want to go for a run, I’d like to be able to keep up. I don’t want to be winded when I’m walking somewhere or going up stairs. I want to be able to move my body into different poses. I want to be able to pick stuff up.</p>
<p>When I am more centered and grounded, I am more able to experience the world. When I am more centered and grounded, I am more able to be kind. When I am more centered and grounded, I am more able to accept weakness, and therefore show vulnerability.</p>
<p>So, what can I change to be more productive, in shape, centered, and grounded? Luckily, the answers are all the same: be more mindful and work out more.</p>
<h1 id="draft-2-3-april-2025">Draft 2: 3 April 2025</h1>
<p>A common idea in economics, especially modern economics, is that a dollar tomorrow is worth less than one today. There are plenty of arguments for this<a href="#fn037" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref7"><sup>7</sup></a>, but most boil down to the obvious that it’s always better to have than to not have. When you combine this with general ideas of compounding interest<a href="#fn038" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref8"><sup>8</sup></a>, you get some ideas about saving like “any dollar you spend today is the same as spending two dollars in ten years or four dollars in twenty or etc etc.”<a href="#fn039" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref9"><sup>9</sup></a> I don’t really love that argument, because like a guitar that costs five hundred dollars today, even if it wouldn’t be worth 2000 to me in twenty years if I was to buy it then, could very well emotionally be worth that amount then. Also, as I talked about in the previous draft, I can only ever experience the present.</p>
<p>I’m now realizing that previous sentence is really the issue underlying a lot of my failure to self care. Any time that I spend doing something unpleasurable now with hopes of it paying dividends in the future is fundamentally happening to an alien me. I have no idea what I will be like even tomorrow, at least on an emotional level. However, much as I can think through choices in ways like “doing this will likely harm someone in another country”, or “this will have bad effects in fifty years”, I think that I can trust that I will always want to be supporting the future me. A future me who turns to a life of crime is likely having a harder time than I am now, and deserves all the help I can give.</p>
<p>So, then, what is the right way to do self care knowing that money spent now is money gone forever, anything gained now will either depreciate<a href="#fn0310" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref10"><sup>10</sup></a> or compound<a href="#fn0311" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref11"><sup>11</sup></a>, and any action I do is ultimately laying another brick in the road of my life.<a href="#fn0312" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>I’m just now rereading the initial prompting, and it was not about self care at all!.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-3-april-2025">Draft 1: 3 April 2025</h1>
<p>In economics, there’s an idea of time discount. In short, it’s the idea that money today is worth more than money tomorrow. For whatever reason, I’ve taken at least a few surveys that ask questions on the nature of “would you rather one hundred dollars at X point in the future or fifty dollars today?” And, in general, I think that I generally have a fairly low time discount, if only because I have a decent understanding of general inflation rates and a pretty low acute need for 50 dollars.</p>
<p>Like most economic theories, this can be immediately applied to absolutely everything, and I’m sure I’m not the first person to treat taking care of myself as a time discount problem. The me of the future will reap a large number of gains for any number of small inconveniences now. Getting a degree, especially an advanced degree, is very often posited in the language of a time discount. “It’s worthwhile to get paid peanuts now,” they say, “because in the future you will make far more!”</p>
<p>Still, my goal here is not to think about how things are worth less to me in the future generally, but to specifically try to reframe the things that I do to take care of myself in this way. At the easiest, let’s take eating.</p>
<p>I know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that I feel better on the day after I ate well than the day after I ate minimally or generally poorly.<a href="#fn0313" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref13"><sup>13</sup></a> I have faith in the medical science that tells me that setting up habits now will make the me of the future healthier. I have no difficulties in putting into practice ideas of saving for the future, and yet I do not put the effort to make sure that the future I fund will be enjoyable by the me of then.</p>
<p>I do know that I have more faith in money, being external to me, than my own health, which is dependent on so much. Still, even in the short term, I know that I am happier, better able to handle life’s struggles, look better, and feel more energized for less sleep when I spend more time working out. I even find that I am more productive, I think even when taking into account the hours spent not working or doing other hobby. However, on any given day, I am almost always more productive when I do not work out.</p>
<p>I don’t really know what else I’m actually trying to say here, other that like when I think about actions that I want to do or want to want to do<a href="#fn0314" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref14"><sup>14</sup></a>, I should really stop framing the present me as much.</p>
<p>There is, of course, the counter argument to a lot of saving. After all, the age of your life when you are most able to take life by the horns<a href="#fn0315" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref15"><sup>15</sup></a> is the age when you’re most encouraged to be planning for the future. In some regards, this is obviously a holdover from when society was more Christian, though I’m not sure if it’s initially a Catholic or Calvinist way of doing the world. However, there is also research saying bad events are more meaningful than good. All that this paragraph is to say: I don’t want to let my aspirations for the future prevent me from experiencing the present.</p>
<p>That’s applicable in finance and self care, even if I think that they take up different spheres.</p>
<h1 id="draft-0-2-april-2025">Draft 0: 2 April 2025</h1>
<p>Wow, look at me, writing parts of drafts before the day I post. Anyways</p>
<p>There’s a concept in economics called time discount. I know that on at least a few occasions I’ve been asked a series of questions that starts with something like “would you rather have 100 dollars today or 50 dollars today?”. This has an obvious and correct answer. After choosing 100, I am then prompted between 50 today or 100 tomorrow.</p>
<h1 id="daily-reflection-3-april-2025">Daily Reflection: 3 April 2025)</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Intentionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At least hourly, stand up, drink water, take two deep breaths, and do a stretch of some sort</p>
<p>I think that I did actually do a pretty good job of this yesterday. I at least paid attention to my body and tried to be standing daily.</p></li>
<li><p>Be proactive about avoiding overwhelm and when feeling overwhelmed, stop and figure out why.</p>
<p>It’s wild how quickly asking myself what, exactly I’m feeling and why stops me from feeling bad.</p></li>
<li><p>Light a candle and read by candlelight each night. Along with this, leave all electronics outside of the bedroom and/or move them away at least an hour before bed time.</p>
<p>Didn’t do great on this one, found a video I really wanted to watch right before bed.</p></li>
<li><p>Candle time in the morning before electronics. Use the time for prayer</p>
<p>Didn’t do this. Found a video I wanted to watch this morning.</p></li>
<li><p>Focus on good posture, especially straight back and making sure that neck isn’t awkwardly positioned.</p>
<p>Did shockingly well at this one, for all that wow it really feels like my upper back is seizing up</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t waste time, and in particular, be mindful about making sure to take breaks and rest. Especially make sure to do rest which revitalizes the me of tomorrow, rather than rest which simply keeps me in stasis.</p>
<p>Did generally ok with this, though while teaching<a href="#fn0316" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref16"><sup>16</sup></a> I did definitely find myself twiddling my thumbs, and as mentioned, watched videos this morning instead of the mindfulness. I did, however, stretch for a full half hour last night. It’s wild how much more fun stretching is when you feel flexible.</p></li>
<li><p>Interpersonal Relationships:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Figure out what belongs in a normal letter to a friend.</p>
<p>Read a book from 1860 yesterday about gentlemanly etiquette. It had a section on letters, which did give the advice of only writing letters when I have a reason to. Outside of that, it was very clear that one needs to write in a clean hand and with good spelling and grammar and etc. The clean hand is probably something I can work on. I have a hand which is beautiful and legible and should work on using it more.</p>
<p>In general, the advice was to simply write in a letter what you would say to a person in person, which was pretty helpful.</p></li>
<li><p>Get back into writing letters.</p></li>
<li><p>Work to message friends at desired intervals. I know that I said today was going to be the day that I made the list, but I don’t know if it is.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Professional:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Do the Thesis and other research requirements. Upcoming deadlines:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Brain dump about science communication (Overdue)</p></li>
<li><p>Brain dump a publicly accessible chapter (Overdue)</p></li>
<li><p>Have final convergences for the results I’m trying to reproduce (due 4/4)</p></li>
<li><p>Draft of the first paper (due end of month, but I want to make sure that I’ve reupdated it sooner than later)</p></li>
<li><p>Finish revising and editing the overview of a program chapter (due 4/7) and send it to the boss</p></li>
<li><p>Revise the Science communication and publicly readable chapters (due 4/7)</p></li>
<li><p>Send the science communication chapter to the boss (4/14)</p></li>
<li><p>Brain Dump the background to the program (4/14)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Only do the work I feel called to when I’ve finished the tasks set to me for the day or outside of normal working hours (post 1725)</p>
<p>Turns out that reminding myself that falling into obsession is bad means that I don’t!</p></li>
<li><p>Start making the giant citation document so that I don’t have to search for citations later.</p>
<p>The old<a href="#fn0317" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref17"><sup>17</sup></a> articles are in Zotero now.</p></li>
<li><p>Work towards future career:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Figure out the difference between my public-facing and field-facing presentation affects. As I focus on becoming a better presenter, I need to become aware of the difference and how to switch them.</p></li>
<li><p>Need to look for jobs</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Health:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Spiritual:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Get back into the Lenten goals (pray chaplet of St. Michael, give money equal to amount I’m spending on myself, stop scrolling social media, stop playing video games)</p>
<p>I printed the chaplet out and brought it to my bedside, did not read it though.</p></li>
<li><p>Be intentional about prayer. That means both making time for prayer and actually doing it.</p>
<p>While teaching the children’s Sunday school analogue<a href="#fn0318" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref18"><sup>18</sup></a>, I made them do some silent prayer, and prayed during that.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Physical:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start focusing on posture again, especially while sitting.</p>
<p>Really did that yesterday, and I’m beginning to wonder if I might end up pushing my shoulders too far down and back. I have to imagine I’ll be able to figure out what that’s like, but given how tight my chest is when I try to sit like that, it’s probably a ways off.</p></li>
<li><p>Go to group fitness classes more regularly and more often. If not, do workout at home</p>
<p>Since the First Wednesday of the Month is always a long day for me, only ended up with a half hour<a href="#fn0319" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref19"><sup>19</sup></a> stretch/yoga time</p></li>
<li><p>Feed myself simply and healthily. Healthy here means trying to generally avoid processing.</p>
<p>On Wednesdays I get suspiciously cheap burgers, and I accept that those are almost certainly hyperprocessed. Otherwise did ok! Forgot berries at home which meant I had oatmeal with jam yesterday, which felt wrong somehow.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Mental:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clean Life:</p></li>
<li><p>Remove dirt and clutter from physical spaces (standard definition of clean): I am still actively behind on this, but I have hope that I will claw my way back to a comfortable place.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At least once a week, each room has nothing on the floor</p></li>
<li><p>At least once a week, all surfaces which are not inherently storage are cleared off</p></li>
<li><p>At least once every two weeks, each room is vacuumed</p></li>
<li><p>At least once every month, all non-storage surfaces are explicitly washed/cleaned</p></li>
<li><p>At least once a week, I get rid of at least one item that I notice (meaning throw away or in rare circumstances gift or donate)</p></li>
<li><p>Clean sight lines. Is my space set up in a way that orients me towards my goals for the space? If not, how can I make it so?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Spend time each day thinking about the goals for the day, and getting them out of my head and onto the page.</p>
<p>This has been really helpful for that, as has making sure that, while my tea brews in the morning, I start by thinking about the goals for the day.</p></li>
<li><p>Continue to explicitly confront the voice in my head that says that people hate me.</p>
<p>Haven’t really needed to do!</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reading</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start reading and returning the library books I have.</p></li>
<li><p>Finish the book on mindfulness I started. (also make a list of the exercises in the book and try them out)</p></li>
<li><p>Read more poetry</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Music:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Work on guitar</p></li>
<li><p>Learn the songs that jam partner suggested and/or requested I learn</p></li>
<li><p>Get back into the album.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Write poetry more often, ideally nightly.</p>
<p>Shoot! Forgot this one</p></li>
<li><p>Find a way to add meta data to my blog posts and then add the meta data</p></li>
<li><p>Not only write blogs, but also post them.</p>
<p>Yesterday I even managed to do this without my writing buddy!!<a href="#fn0320" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Get back into writing the web novel</p></li>

<h1 id="on-science-communication"><a href="science-communication.html">On Science Communication</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2025 April 2</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-2-april-2025">Draft 1: 2 April 2025</h1>
<p>I’m wondering if the daily reflection I have might be too long. It’s great and all, but spending twenty minutes every day on them feels like a lot. Then again, it isn’t as though I really need the twenty minutes for anything. Time I choose to spend is time well spent. That’s probably a good thing for me to keep reminding myself.</p>
<p>Onto the actual meat of this post. As I have mentioned here before, my current career plans have me going into science communication in some form or another. One of the leading voices in the field, at least as far as I know, is a Professor Emeritus at my school. I met with him a few weeks ago to get his advice on finding a career in the space. He gave me a lot of good advice, and in particular gave me a few questions that are important for me to answer.</p>
<p>This is a space for me to try to think of some initial answers to the questions.</p>
<p>His first thing to remember, though not a general question, was what the purpose of any given demonstration is. That is, what am I trying to communicate, and is what I have prepared effective for that task?</p>
<p>The two biggest questions were really, “why should I care about science?” and “why should my tax dollars go to funding (insert research that does not seem to improve someone’s life)?”<a href="#fn041" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> I’m going to treat them as the same question, at least to start, but will keep in mind that they are not intrinsically the same question.</p>
<p>So, why should a random person care about science?</p>
<p>At a visceral level, I cannot think of an answer to this question. There’s a meme that goes around sometimes that says something along the lines of “if you don’t care about other people, I don’t know how I can convince you to.” It feels similar to my feelings about science. Why should someone care about science feels like as ridiculous a question as why someone should care about others. Still, that’s not a good way to win any hearts or minds, so let’s fight past our own reactions.</p>
<p>My general life view says that we are all born interested. Before we know how to divide the world into science and art and language and sport, we simply absorb what’s around us. I don’t think that I have ever met a child who was not at least nominally interested in anything, when framed correctly.</p>
<p>Life, or to be more precise, the systems that we all live in, beat the joy out of learning and exploration for so many people. When I was in college, a frequent question I would ask my teammates and prospective students looking to join the team what hobbies they had outside of the sport. A number of them had no answer. This used to surprise me, until I learned more about the difference between going to school in rural versus urban America.</p>
<p>In rural America, it is not only acceptable, it is almost expected to be somewhat of a dilettante, at least in my experience. There simply are not enough people in the entire school to be able to segregate groups into a single activity. There were of course general trends and class divides, even if I did not see them at the time. After all, if you need to work every night to put food on the table, you aren’t going to be able to do every extracurricular.</p>
<p>Almost every athlete did multiple sports, especially the top ones. The only exceptions to this that I can think of are some swimmers and soccer players, who joined club teams during the off season. In part, I have to assume that’s because the programs were all no cut. If you showed up and put in work, you were guaranteed a spot in the team, and as far as I can tell, everyone generally had a chance to even compete. You might not end up on the varsity squad, but playing JV is still doing a sport.</p>
<p>I compare this to my friends’ experiences going to schools in larger cities. Starting from early middle school, school sponsored activities begin actively cutting students. If you didn’t know that you wanted to be a swimmer before entering high school, it is suddenly too late to do so. Even once you’re on the team, though, you aren’t safe. The fact that cuts exist at all means that there is a constant existential need to focus on the single activity.</p>
<p>I can relate to that now. The looming deadline of my thesis does make it harder for me to do other activities, because I am constantly asking myself if the time would be better spent doing something else. I feel beyond blessed to have ended up going to a small college, which gave me the chance to continue being an amateur.<a href="#fn042" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Returning to the point of the question, and hoping that I don’t go on the rant again, my initial answer to why someone should care about science is that they once did, and life is better when we care about more things. As the PE<a href="#fn043" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref3"><sup>3</sup></a> stressed, the first and primary goal of science communication should always be to have a conversation with someone else. Too, the primary goal of a conversation should always be setting the stage for the next conversation. In a conversation about science, the most important thing is to share feelings, not facts.</p>
<p>There’s a recent Pope that made a similar point about conversion. People are convinced by experience and emotion, not by raw facts. Even within the sciences, we know this to be true. The scientists that everyone points to as the best lecturers and teachers are the ones whose presentation styles are animated and draw the listener in.</p>
<p>So, if someone asks me why they should care about science, my first question to them should<a href="#fn044" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref4"><sup>4</sup></a> be what they care about right now. It is important that the question doesn’t feel like an attack or a deflection, so framing it as something like “I don’t really know you well enough to know why you should or shouldn’t care about science. What do you care about right now?” Then, and importantly, I need to actively listen to what they say, not to find the way that I can tie their interest to science, but simply because they’re a full human, and deserve to be listened to.</p>
<p>Somewhere I need to do a reflection on how cults work, in part, by making people feel seen, and how I can weaponize<a href="#fn045" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref5"><sup>5</sup></a> that knowledge towards good.<a href="#fn046" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>However, despite the fact that the first goal of my science communication is a conversation and the second goal is therefore to have another conversation, the third goal is to make them leave the conversation at least a little more pro-science. As a result, it does still become important to figure out why they don’t care about science. I have the internal idea<a href="#fn047" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref7"><sup>7</sup></a> that people will generally tell you why they dislike or don’t care about something better if you ask them tangentially related questions. Deep in my heart of hearts, I do legitimately believe that most people want the world to be a better place. At the end of the day, if I cannot agree with someone on that basic premise, I might just have to accept that I cannot communicate with them about science.</p>
<p>However, wanting the world to be a better place still leaves a lot of room for disagreement. In general, I think that the quest for knowledge is a good in and of itself, not simply as a means to something else. Many people, however, want knowledge to have a use, especially knowledge that their tax dollars support, and that is also reasonable.</p>
<p>I can’t ever imagine “you pay far less to fund science than you do to (insert other thing)” will ever be a useful line of questioning. So, what else can I say that researching prebiotic astrochemistry is good for? An answer I probably shouldn’t and won’t give but is true is that it keeps the sort of people who would do that kind of work from doing something else. We all know enough horror stories of mad science to not take the idea of keeping scientists placated at least a little bit seriously.</p>
<p>Many medical students do research as undergraduates before entering medical school. Giving them the chance to do research of their own equips them with the tools to better understand new advances in medicine. In general, there are plenty of versions of “funding any research is good because research helps people.”</p>
<p>A fair counterpoint is that we could get all those benefits by studying something useful. This is where we get to the real issue with communicating the need for science funding: there is very rarely a way to know what discovery will be important in a hundred years’<a href="#fn048" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref8"><sup>8</sup></a> time. Newton’s experiments with light were nothing more than a fun diversion until quantum mechanics became relevant. Gauss’s understanding of electricity and magnetism only became important to the average person when we began using electricity.</p>
<p>On the other hand, all the research we did into vacuum tubes for computing was, in retrospect, not really needed. We now know how to make semiconductors without these tubes, and so computing can be done with far smaller pieces. Without knowing what a semiconductor is, there would have been no way for people to research them. Without a need for semiconductors in computing, the fact that silicon can easily be made to take on different semiconducting properties is mostly irrelevant.</p>
<p>All that to say, the biggest reason to fund any given research that sounds silly is that we never know where important facts will be discovered.</p>
<p>There is also the secondary point, which is that almost<a href="#fn049" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref9"><sup>9</sup></a> any research can be made to sound ridiculous when framed by a bad actor. I do not know if all research can be framed to sound as though it has merit, but I think any research worth doing can be. Then again, I think that “we didn’t know this and now we do” is a totally valid answer.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s the final set of arguments, which is that a lot of seemingly frivolous hard science is in fact just basic science. Exactly one person needs to measure most things in chemistry and physics, and then everyone else can use that information forever. I do not need to take the gas phase rotational spectrum of water to know if it’s in my sample. The more tools we have, the better we can build.</p>
<p>So, I guess that one of my answers does really boil down to the fact that having more tools available is always better, even if using more of them isn’t better for any specific case. Without looking into the future, there is no way to know what problems tomorrow will bring, and so there is no way of knowing what information will be needed then. Even moreso, without knowing what question to ask, we cannot hope to find an answer.</p>
<h1 id="daily-reflection-2-april-2025">Daily Reflection: 2 April 2025)</h1>
<p>N.B. Since I’ve realized that I will often give up halfway through a post, I’ve decided that I’m going to start each post now with the daily set of reflections.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Intentionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At least hourly, stand up, drink water, take two deep breaths, and do a stretch of some sort</p>
<p>This went pretty well yesterday! I think I forgot about it a little while TAing, but not too terribly much</p></li>
<li><p>Be proactive about avoiding overwhelm and when feeling overwhelmed, stop and figure out why.</p>
<p>I think I did ok about this. Yesterday I did feel horrible more than a few times, and simply realizing that wow I’m fundamentally just really sad about my mom is something that helped the overwhelm pass.</p></li>
<li><p>Light a candle and read by candlelight each night. Along with this, leave all electronics outside of the bedroom and/or move them away at least an hour before bed time.</p>
<p>For some reason the flame in my candle really wildly swings every few seconds, which made reading a bit of a pain. I did, however, remove all the electronics from my room and read before bed, which was really peaceful.</p></li>
<li><p>Candle time in the morning before electronics. Use the time for prayer Did not have candle time this morning, but I did also realize that there’s no real point to my morning alarm, because I would rather be well rested than up early, so I’ve now set the alarm such that it is only for the absolute latest that I can get up and not miss anything.<a href="#fn0410" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref10"><sup>10</sup></a> I did try to pray the chaplet to St. Michael, then remembered that I don’t have it memorized. Will print it out to solve that issue</p></li>
<li><p>Focus on good posture, especially straight back and making sure that neck isn’t awkwardly positioned.</p>
<p>In general I’ve been trying, but it does really feel like it puts a lot of pressure on the part of my back just below my ribcage, which I’m not sure about the reason for or health of. I should look that up tomorrow</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t waste time, and in particular, be mindful about making sure to take breaks and rest. Especially make sure to do rest which revitalizes the me of tomorrow, rather than rest which simply keeps me in stasis.</p>
<p>I did 45 minutes of stretching yesterday when I got home from grocery shopping, and it did do a lot to revitalize me before bed. That feels a little strange, but I mean that it took me from feeling exhausted and run down to just like sleepy, if that makes sense.</p></li>
<li><p>Interpersonal Relationships:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Figure out what belongs in a normal letter to a friend.</p>
<p>I have requested a number of books on etiquette from the 20th century, and we will see if any of them end up being useful for what I need.</p></li>
<li><p>Get back into writing letters.</p>
<p>Going to my cell in the library is a bit of a journey, but it’s also something that I know beyond the shadow of a doubt is good for me, so that’s a difficult tradeoff. It might help me to start actively working to spend time doing the reading I need to do in there.</p></li>
<li><p>Work to message friends at desired intervals.</p>
<p>I still need to make the list of friends. That might be a tomorrow task, though.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Professional:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Do the Thesis and other research requirements. Upcoming deadlines:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Brain dump about science communication (Overdue)</p></li>
<li><p>Brain dump a publicly accessible chapter (Overdue)</p></li>
<li><p>Have final convergences for the results I’m trying to reproduce (due 4/4)</p></li>
<li><p>Draft of the first paper (due end of month, but I want to make sure that I’ve reupdated it sooner than later)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Only do the work I feel called to when I’ve finished the tasks set to me for the day or outside of normal working hours (post 1725)</p></li>
<li><p>Start making the giant citation document so that I don’t have to search for citations later.</p></li>
<li><p>Work towards future career:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Do the reflections that were recommended to me (mostly focused around why I care about science communication. See above</p></li>
<li><p>Figure out the difference between my public-facing and field-facing presentation affects. As I focus on becoming a better presenter, I need to become aware of the difference and how to switch them.</p></li>
<li><p>Need to look for jobs</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Health:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Spiritual:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Get back into the Lenten goals (pray chaplet of St. Michael, give money equal to amount I’m spending on myself, stop scrolling social media, stop playing video games)</p>
<p>I did try to pray it the chaplet this morning, but I forgot most of the parts.<a href="#fn0411" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Be intentional about prayer. That means both making time for prayer and actually doing it.</p>
<p>I prayed a little before bed and a little this morning, which is progress. I’m also being better about praying before meals again, which is good for me.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Physical:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start focusing on posture again, especially while sitting.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, I do feel like this makes it harder for me to breathe. Will have to look up why that is and figure out if it’s that those muscles are too weak or what.</p></li>
<li><p>Go to group fitness classes more regularly and more often.</p>
<p>Yesterday I instead, as mentioned above, did a self guided workout for about 45 minutes while catching up on some content creators whose content I enjoy. It was pretty nice, but I did not push my core or other parts as much as in a normal class. Then again, I let myself spend more time in many of the poses, which was also good. I did find that my mat is stretchy, especially on movements<a href="#fn0412" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref12"><sup>12</sup></a> like downward dog. It’s wild to me that I can touch my toes for the first time maybe ever, but certainly since college started. It feels nice</p></li>
<li><p>Feed myself simply and healthily. Healthy here means trying to generally avoid processing.</p>
<p>I’ve been eating oatmeal for breakfast on work mornings, and it’s been generally good for keeping me going through the day. I have even been generally good about remembering to bring in some frozen blueberries or mixed berries, which add health, taste, and color!</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Mental:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clean Life:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Remove dirt and clutter from physical spaces (standard definition of clean):</p>
<p>I’m still working to play catch up on this, but I have been trying. This morning I cleaned up some clutter, and if I have energy tonight, I will do so again. The hard part is absolutely that I have too much stuff, and I need to be more intentional about getting rid of things.<a href="#fn0413" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>At least once a week, each room has nothing on the floor</p></li>
<li><p>At least once a week, all surfaces which are not inherently storage are cleared off</p></li>
<li><p>At least once every two weeks, each room is vacuumed</p></li>
<li><p>At least once every month, all non-storage surfaces are explicitly washed/cleaned</p></li>
<li><p>At least once a week, I get rid of at least one item that I notice (meaning throw away or in rare circumstances gift or donate)</p></li>
<li><p>Clean sight lines. Is my space set up in a way that orients me towards my goals for the space? If not, how can I make it so?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Spend time each day thinking about the goals for the day, and getting them out of my head and onto the page.</p>
<p>I’ve spend about 15 minutes on this so far today, and that doesn’t count the three or four minutes that I spent planning the work I’m going to do today. Still, I think that it was time well spent.</p></li>
<li><p>Continue to explicitly confront the voice in my head that says that people hate me.</p>
<p>Actively did so yesterday! Left an encounter with a friend feeling really angry, asked myself why, and realized that the feelings were misplaced.<a href="#fn0414" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reading</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start reading and returning the library books I have.</p>
<p>Not so much yesterday, but that’s ok. It remains a lower priority than the other activities I have been doing.</p></li>
<li><p>Finish the book on mindfulness I started. (also make a list of the exercises in the book and try them out)</p>
<p>Read some yesterday! It was nice, and shockingly emotionally connective for me, which is always strange.</p></li>
<li><p>Read more poetry</p>
<p>This is more aspirational than anything else. Still, it would behoove me to sign up for a poem of a day somewhere.<a href="#fn0415" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Music:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Work on guitar</p>
<p>Practiced a little bit by candlelight last night! I need to bring home the exercises for guitar that are on my desk.</p></li>
<li><p>Learn the songs that jam partner suggested and/or requested I learn</p></li>
<li><p>Get back into the album.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Write poetry more often, ideally nightly.</p>
<p>Wrote some last night! Or, at least, wrote some words that I intended as poetry. Without strict meter and rhyming, I find that I can’t really distinguish between prose and poetry at a fundamental level. Probably good to talk to someone about this.</p></li>
<li><p>Find a way to add meta data to my blog posts and then add the meta data</p></li>
<li><p>Not only write blogs, but also post them.</p>
<p>Did so yesterday, will do again today</p></li>
<li><p>Get back into writing the web novel</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Other hobbies, do them.</p></li>
</ul></li>

<h1 id="monthly-reflection"><a href="reflection-march-25.html">Monthly Reflection</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2025 April 1</p>
<h1 id="draft-2-1-april-2025">Draft 2: 1 April 2025</h1>
<p>N.B. the two drafts are markedly different, and they cover somewhat very different things</p>
<p>Time has continued its ceaseless march ever forward, and marching, passed March by. My experience has been detaching from time again, which isn’t great, but is true. With that in mind, I will really reaffirm here my goal to write on this site more often. I do not know what happened this past month, or really this year so far, and I do not like that.</p>
<p>Still, in the interest of giving myself grace, it’s good to remember why I wasn’t blogging. The past few days in particular, I was really focused on the derivation for some equations that I just realized might be helpful for me. Looking with a little more intention, I realize that I let myself be consumed by that project, and the consumption is not particularly healthy. Moving forward, I want to be better at keeping myself outside of obsession.</p>
<p>Five great things from March:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Tentative approval for my defense timeline</p></li>
<li><p>Received an award for outstanding service to the university</p></li>
<li><p>Got a massage</p></li>
<li><p>Had friends respond positively when I asked them about contact rates</p></li>
<li><p>Started writing choral music</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This coming April, five things I’m looking forward to are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Leading the science experiment this coming Saturday.</p></li>
<li><p>Going to a friend’s thesis defense</p></li>
<li><p>Finishing and submitting my first first author paper</p></li>
<li><p>Writing more with a close friend</p></li>
<li><p>Becoming more of the person that I would like to be, both by changing and by changing my goals.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Particular areas I want to focus on this month:<a href="#fn051" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Prayer. This has been at the bottom of my priorities for months now, and I am finally starting to notice the consequences. I want to reconnect with the Almighty, and that requires prayer.</p></li>
<li><p>Physical health. I know that I have more energy and feel better when I work out more often, and so I really need to make that an emphasis</p></li>
<li><p>Avoiding obsession. I know that I can let myself get stuck on a problem until I solve it, and I also know that doing so means that I fall behind on everything else that I want to be doing. When I catch myself obsessing, stop.</p></li>
<li><p>Intentionality in general. I want to make sure that what I do and plan to do is what I want to be doing. In particular, I want to make the choices I want to do the path of least resistance, which I think means making more schedules and forcing myself to follow them.<a href="#fn052" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Working on hobbies. I know that I feel more complete as a human when I do things other than research. More than that, the time I spend on research is improved by taking time off.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While that is five items, many of them intersect in a variety of ways. All in all, I know that I am better when I don’t rely on my internal memory, but instead have it extended into a readily available source. I need that source, however, to not be as messy as my own mind, which is its own problem. Still, the better I become at setting and enforcing boundaries, the better all of this will become as well.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing the person I become, and I look forward to seeing the person I was and am as I continue to reflect.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-1-april-2025">Draft 1: 1 April 2025</h1>
<p>It’s been somehow another month. Time continues its aggressive march forward, and it has left March behind. Despite the fact that I had exactly three (3)<a href="#fn053" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref3"><sup>3</sup></a> blog posts for the month, it seems good for me to do my usual monthly reflection.</p>
<p>I really haven’t been doing much blogging at all this year, which is a bit of a shame, though tracks with the fact that I have no real sense of how time has moved this year. Still, it’s always good for me to have some highlights from the previous month:<a href="#fn054" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Met with my committee and set a tentative thesis defense date! It’s so wild to me that they all think that I can be done in just a few more months.</p></li>
<li><p>Got an award for dedication to giving talks to the broader state-wide community</p></li>
<li><p>Got positive responses from my friends when I asked them all about the rate that they wanted me to message them.</p></li>
<li><p>Got a massage!</p></li>
<li><p>Started writing choral music again.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s interesting to me that a full majority of these are things that happened to me<a href="#fn055" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref5"><sup>5</sup></a>, but that’s probably fine.</p>
<p>What are five things that I’m looking forward to in the coming month?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Leading a science exploration day this Saturday!</p></li>
<li><p>Going to a friend’s thesis defense</p></li>
<li><p>Finishing and submitting my first first author paper</p></li>
<li><p>Going to a farmer’s<a href="#fn056" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref6"><sup>6</sup></a> market</p></li>
<li><p>Writing more with a close friend!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Normally I would now go through the goals that I had last month and see how I did, and then create the goals for the coming month. However, my goals list is currently a living document, so that’s kind of taken care of. Still, probably good to at least reflect on them as a macro level.</p>
<p>I still like the division between Professional, Health, and Other, and I think that the upcoming deadlines will be nice as well. It might make more sense for me to move upcoming deadlines into the Professional, especially since effectively all of the deadlines that I have are in relation to the thesis I’m writing. Professional otherwise just reminds me that wow I am not doing a good job of actually working towards a future career.</p>
<p>Health being broken into mental, physical, and spiritual still seems good, and the order seems reasonable to me still. I think that the cleaning goals will become reasonable once I’ve achieved them a single time. Still, that does mean that I need to start prioritizing them more. Today, much as I want to work on the idea for my research that I had as I was getting ready to leave work on Friday, I should<a href="#fn057" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref7"><sup>7</sup></a> probably instead go home and clean, especially since I’ll be busy tomorrow night.</p>
<p>Cleaning my life belonging in mental health remains kind of odd to me, but I can’t really say that I disagree with it, since I do feel like it’s my mental health that suffers the most from not having a clean life. I’ve added the goal of candlelight time each night, and I’m realizing that part of my problem is not feeling like I have a comfortable place to sit in my apartment outside of my bed. I don’t know if that means that I should get a new couch, a new chair, make a bundle of blankets and call it a sitting location, or what, but it is certainly something to consider. Goals for the day remains a good thing for me to do. Doing it this morning certainly helped me feel far less stressed and frantic than yesterday, where I did not take the time. In general, I think that I should probably just make more of an effort to be intentional, in the senses of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Do the things I know prevent me from feeling overwhelmed. (e.g. fill my water pitcher in the morning when entering work, check my list of tasks and make sure they’re still accurate)</p></li>
<li><p>When I feel overwhelmed, take the time to reflect and figure out why, and then write down what’s making me feel so.</p></li>
<li><p>Take at least a little time every hour, at the very least, to stand, stretch, drink water, and take two deep breaths.<a href="#fn058" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t really know where intention should go, but I think that I might like it to be its own category. This month, I think that physical health is more important to me than mental health<a href="#fn059" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Hmm, only having three physical health goals is a little lacking, for all that they do really make space for how I want to improve. I suppose that making an actual diet plan could be good<a href="#fn0510" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref10"><sup>10</sup></a>, and that might be a worthwhile activity for tonight while cleaning. Honestly, posture probably belongs in intentionality, so I’ll have it double listed.</p>
<p>Spiritual health remains the highest priority, so it remains at the top of the list, and I’m trying to figure out where to add the time. Candles in the morning for the chaplet could be a good starting spot. I’m realizing that the candle is better placed in intentionality, so have moved it there.</p>
<p>Interpersonal relationships I think should be moved into intentionality, since the goal of the interpersonal relationships is to be more intentional. I also think the bit about rest can be there as well! Wow this is getting revamped a ton.</p>
<p>I’d like to have a schedule of blog posts, which probably deserves to live somewhere outside of the daily posts. Then again, it could be a fun way for readers to see what they’re going to get. Eh, I think that it’s better to let me decide what needs to come on each day, for all that there are a number of posts that I do really feel like I need to have on certain days. I should make a list of the lists I’m trying to make right now<a href="#fn0511" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref11"><sup>11</sup></a>, because I know that otherwise I’ll forget it all.</p>
<p>Other is a category that’s grown just so much since the start of the document, and it’s probably worthwhile to consider breaking it apart. Right now I basically have the reading goal of getting through the library books, which is arguably an intentionality thing, doing music, writing things that could be fun, and other artistic endeavors I’d like to do. I have forgotten what embroidery physical relic means, and that’s a bit of a shame. Oh, duh, I literally just meant that I should embroider something.</p>
<p>What can I call these things? Hobbies? That’s probably a better term, and then I can move the other creative ideas that I generally have into their own, again separate, living document, since they’re not going to happen on the blog. I don’t really think that I need to be actively working on all of the hobbies at once, and so it could be good to treat them instead as potential options, which I put in my schedule as items for restorative rest.</p>
<p>Great, that’s really the whole new set of daily goals (which I’ve put in the modified Daily Reflection section, which I did not leave as a record of the changes I made, because that goal of the blog has been abandoned. Let’s clean up these thoughts in the next draft and then call it good to post.</p>
<h1 id="daily-reflection-1-april-2025">Daily Reflection: 1 April 2025)</h1>
<p>N.B. Since I’ve realized that I will often give up halfway through a post, I’ve decided that I’m going to start each post now with the daily set of reflections.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Intentionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At least hourly, stand up, drink water, take two deep breaths, and do a stretch of some sort</p></li>
<li><p>Be proactive about avoiding overwhelm and when feeling overwhelmed, stop and figure out why</p></li>
<li><p>Light a candle and read by candlelight each night. Along with this, leave all electronics outside of the bedroom and/or move them away at least an hour before bed time.</p></li>
<li><p>Candle time in the morning before electronics. Use the time for prayer</p></li>
<li><p>Focus on good posture, especially straight back and making sure that neck isn’t awkwardly positioned.<a href="#fn0512" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Don’t waste time, and in particular, be mindful about making sure to take breaks and rest. Especially make sure to do rest which revitalizes the me of tomorrow, rather than rest which simply keeps me in stasis.</p>
<p>This weekend wasn’t great for non-stasis activities, but I’ve got ideas for how to do so moving forward.</p></li>
<li><p>Interpersonal Relationships:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Figure out what belongs in a normal letter to a friend.</p></li>
<li><p>Get back into writing letters.</p>
<p>Wrote one on Sunday!</p></li>
<li><p>Work to message friends at desired intervals.</p>
<p>I need to make a list of the friends who responded and their preferred intervals.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Professional:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Do the Thesis and other research requirements. Upcoming deadlines:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Brain dump about science communication (Overdue)<a href="#fn0513" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Brain dump a publicly accessible chapter (Overdue)</p></li>
<li><p>Revise the overview of my program, which also means finishing writing it up<a href="#fn0514" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref14"><sup>14</sup></a> (Overdue)</p></li>
<li><p>Have final convergences for the results I’m trying to reproduce (due 4/4)<a href="#fn0515" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Draft of the first paper (due end of month, but I want to make sure that I’ve reupdated it sooner than later)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Only do the work I feel called to when I’ve finished the tasks set to me for the day or outside of normal working hours (post 1725)</p></li>
<li><p>Start making the giant citation document so that I don’t have to search for citations later.</p></li>
<li><p>Work towards future career:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Read the recommended readings about science communication. Just did.</p></li>
<li><p>Do the reflections that were recommended to me (mostly focused around why I care about science communication)</p>
<p>Tomorrow.</p></li>
<li><p>Figure out the difference between my public-facing and field-facing presentation affects. As I focus on becoming a better presenter, I need to become aware of the difference and how to switch them.</p></li>
<li><p>Need to look for jobs</p>
<p>Have started! Now I need to start actually filling out applications, etc.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Health:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Spiritual:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Get back into the Lenten goals (pray chaplet of St. Michael, give money equal to amount I’m spending on myself, stop scrolling social media, stop playing video games)</p></li>
<li><p>Be intentional about prayer. That means both making time for prayer and actually doing it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Physical:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start focusing on posture again, especially while sitting.</p></li>
<li><p>Go to group fitness classes more regularly and more often.</p>
<p>I think that a secondary goal could be that if I don’t go in the morning and there’s not a class I can make it to in the evening that I’ll just do one myself at home. I have a yoga mat and a family subscription to some yoga classes.</p></li>
<li><p>Feed myself simply and healthily. Healthy here means trying to generally avoid processing.</p>
<p>Honestly, I didn’t realize how much I actively crave artificial dyes. I still have some candy that was gifted to me, so I’m also going to keep eating it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Mental:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clean Life:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Remove dirt and clutter from physical spaces (standard definition of clean):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At least once a week, each room has nothing on the floor</p></li>
<li><p>At least once a week, all surfaces which are not inherently storage are cleared off</p></li>
<li><p>At least once every two weeks, each room is vacuumed</p></li>
<li><p>At least once every month, all non-storage surfaces are explicitly washed/cleaned</p></li>
<li><p>At least once a week, I get rid of at least one item that I notice (meaning throw away or in rare circumstances gift or donate)</p></li>
<li><p>Clean sight lines. Is my space set up in a way that orients me towards my goals for the space? If not, how can I make it so?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So far I’m behind, but the goal right now is really getting to a baseline where that’s possible</p></li>
<li><p>Spend time each day thinking about the goals for the day, and getting them out of my head and onto the page.</p>
<p>Yesterday I started by just working and wow I felt horribly overwhelmed right away. Today I spent like 10 minutes looking over the schedule I had previously set for myself, and I feel much more ready for the month</p></li>
<li><p>Continue to explicitly confront the voice in my head that says that people hate me.</p>
<p>Have been, and will continue to do so.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reading</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start reading and returning the library books I have.</p>
<p>I want to set the goal of at least one book a week, but that may not be possible, given so much stuff.</p></li>
<li><p>Finish the book on mindfulness I started. (also make a list of the exercises in the book and try them out)</p></li>
<li><p>Read more poetry</p></li>

<h1 id="for-twenty-six"><a href="twenty-six.html">26 for Twenty Six</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 27 March 2025</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-27-march-2025">Draft 1: 27 March 2025</h1>
<p>This will officially be my <a href="twenty-four.html">third</a> <a href="twenty-five.html">year</a> attempting to do a number of new tasks over the course of the year.<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> I more and more realize that this has become less of a way for me to start doing more new things and much more a way of making sure that I recognize the many ways that I’m continuing to grow as a person.</p>
<p>Even though I’m well into this year of my life, I still want to have finished with this by the time I turn twenty seven! Let’s see what things I’ve already done, and then start to consider what else I want to do:<a href="#fn062" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Learned to live with a single living parent.<a href="#fn063" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Saw Hozier live in concert<a href="#fn064" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Checked in with most of my friends to make sure that I was communicating appropriately. That’s really mostly me accepting that I like to have expectations explicitly stated and trusting my friends enough to do so.</p></li>
<li><p>Officially gave up on my web novel.<a href="#fn065" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Seasoned a wok!<a href="#fn066" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Sharpened my own knives at home<a href="#fn067" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Sat Shiva! It was a really fantastic experience, in as much as anything about grieving can be good. Watching someone else near to me deal with the loss of a parent without Shiva<a href="#fn068" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref8"><sup>8</sup></a> really highlighted just how beneficial it was in terms of my ability to process my grief and accept the way that life is forever going to be different for me.</p></li>
<li><p>Did a large embroidery pattern<a href="#fn069" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Was the entirety of the stage crew for a cabaret. I don’t quite know how to phrase this one, but it’s mostly that I was the sole person for staging all the props and scenes for a number of small acts. It was kind of weird having such responsibility</p></li>
<li><p>Joined a book club with some church friends<a href="#fn0610" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Joined a community choir! It’s TTBB which is also really cool</p></li>
<li><p>Went to adult night at the local conservatory (nature not music)</p></li>
<li><p>Started going to a weekly watch party for a television show. I really don’t think that I’ve ever really kept up with a show as it aired each week</p></li>
<li><p>Did an unassisted downward dog!<a href="#fn0611" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Tried a bunch of different fitness classes!<a href="#fn0612" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Started teaching children’s religious education</p></li>
<li><p>Designed a novel search pattern<a href="#fn0613" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Was explicitly acknowledged in a Ph.D. defense not as a formality<a href="#fn0614" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Started using the university-wide high throughput computing center</p></li>
<li><p>Got an award for service: I apparently gave talks in the greatest number of counties through the university’s talk program</p></li>
<li><p>Learned how to crochet flowers</p></li>
<li><p>Realized that my life is better when I wear good noise cancelling headphones, bought a pair, and became comfortable wearing them in public</p></li>
<li><p>Will<a href="#fn0615" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref15"><sup>15</sup></a> lead an interactive science demo with children.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Wildly, that’s already twenty three items. Many of them are things that I don’t really think that I would count if given the option, and so let’s pare the list down to things that I actually consider novel:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Learned to live with a single living parent.</p></li>
<li><p>Saw Hozier live in concert</p></li>
<li><p>Seasoned a wok!</p></li>
<li><p>Sharpened my own knives at home</p></li>
<li><p>Sat shiva<a href="#fn0616" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Did a large embroidery pattern<a href="#fn0617" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Did the entire stage managing and crewing for a small cabaret production</p></li>
<li><p>Joined a community choir! It’s TTBB which is also really cool</p></li>
<li><p>Went to adult night at the local conservatory (nature not music)</p></li>
<li><p>Started going to a weekly watch party for a television show. I really don’t think that I’ve ever really kept up with a show as it aired each week</p></li>
<li><p>Did an unassisted downward dog!<a href="#fn0618" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Started teaching children’s religious education</p></li>
<li><p>Got an award for service: I apparently gave talks in the greatest number of counties through the university’s talk program</p></li>
<li><p>Learned how to crochet flowers</p></li>
<li><p>Will<a href="#fn0619" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref19"><sup>19</sup></a> lead an interactive science demo with children.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>That’s still 15! That means I need to do eleven in the next four months, which is more than doable, hopefully! That’s a relief, honestly, and really points out just how much my mind lies to me. I did really believe that I had not done anything novel this year, entirely because I thought that my mom’s death had been all consuming. It’s nice to know that that isn’t true! Only two and a half of the items are explicitly related to that, and the rest I don’t think were impacted at all! Wild how life continues to go on even when I want it to stop, and wild that I continued to actively live even when I felt like I was behind a curtain watching life pass me by.</p>
<p>N.B. This is the living list of ways that I want to take care of myself and/or goals that I have and/or things that I want to do. I’m planning to start adding the shorter term goals that I have to this as well.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Professional:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Continue to work at work</p></li>
<li><p>Work towards future career:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Read the recommended readings about science communication.</p></li>
<li><p>Do the reflections that were recommended to me (mostly focused around why I care about science communication)</p></li>
<li><p>Figure out the difference between my public-facing and field-facing presentation affects. As I focus on becoming a better presenter, I need to become aware of the difference and how to switch them</p></li>
<li><p>Need to look for jobs</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Health:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Spiritual:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Get back into the Lenten goals (pray chaplet of St. Michael, give money equal to amount I’m spending on myself, stop scrolling social media, stop playing video games)</p></li>
<li><p>Be intentional about prayer. That means both making time for prayer and actually doing it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Mental:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clean my Life:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Remove dirt and clutter from physical spaces (standard definition of clean). I’m going to change this goal to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At least once a week, each room has nothing on the floor</p></li>
<li><p>At least once a week, all surfaces which are not inherently storage are cleared off</p></li>
<li><p>At least once every two weeks, each room is vacuumed</p></li>
<li><p>At least once every month, all non-storage surfaces are explicitly washed/cleaned</p></li>
<li><p>At least once a week, I get rid of at least one item that I notice (meaning throw away or in rare circumstances gift or donate)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Spend time each day thinking about the goals for the day, and getting them out of my head and onto the page. I still don’t know how to do this, but I also feel like I have less explicit goals these days.</p></li>
<li><p>Start reading and returning the library books I have. I’m going to try to do better at this, but I don’t know how</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t waste time, and in particular, be mindful about making sure to take breaks and rest. Especially make sure to do rest which revitalizes the me of tomorrow, rather than rest which simply keeps me in stasis</p></li>
<li><p>Clean sight lines. Is my space set up in a way that orients me towards my goals for the space? If not, how can I make it so? Darn curse of entropy.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Interpersonal Relationships:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Figure out what belongs in a normal letter to a friend.</p></li>
<li><p>Get back into writing letters.</p></li>
<li><p>Continue to explicitly confront the voice in my head that says that people hate me</p></li>
<li><p>Work to message friends at desired intervals.</p></li>
<li><p>Potentially start giving small gifts, though many people also dislike clutter, so think carefully about that one. Have started giving friends things as I have them, and they’re well received. Thoughtfulness is the key.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Physical:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Go to group fitness classes more regularly and more often. Gym is closed this week, I learned yesterday. I really need to start going to yoga in the mornings, especially since my afternoons and evenings are about to get really full.</p></li>
<li><p>Feed myself simply and healthily. Healthy here means trying to generally avoid processing.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Other:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Music:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Work on guitar</p></li>
<li><p>Learn the songs that jam partner suggested and/or requested I learn</p></li>
<li><p>Get back into the album. I was jamming with the friend on Saturday and they talked me up to their partner about having written music. I couldn’t remember the chords for one of the songs, and that’s kind of sad to me.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Write poetry more often, ideally nightly. Wrote some free prose yesterday!</p></li>
<li><p>Find a way to add meta data to my blog posts and then add the meta data<a href="#fn0620" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Not only write blogs, but also post them. Ideas include:<a href="#fn0621" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>26 for 26 Wow! Lookie here</p></li>
<li><p>Listening to an album and writing about my experience with it. Unsure if this is best done with one I have prior knowledge of or a new one, but regardless, sit and listen without other stimuli. One of my lab mates and I have been exchanging albums, so this could be fun</p></li>
<li><p>The arts I’ve been doing lately</p></li>
<li><p>Why I care about science and communicating it<a href="#fn0622" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>My general disposition to authority. I’m not entirely sure what that meant, but it was a note I wrote to myself while half asleep, so I’ll leave it here.</p></li>
<li><p>How to feed myself. How I am, how I would like to, and what the difference is</p></li>
<li><p>Motivation, autotelic motivation, etc. etc.</p></li>
<li><p>The idea I have that knowledge (music, writing, science, etc.) is revealed, not acquired</p></li>
<li><p>Understanding the human experience, esp. in/re. writing</p></li>
<li><p>Doing the work to improve myself and time discount</p></li>
<li><p>My writing style(s) and what they show</p></li>
<li><p>The four levels of mastery</p></li>
<li><p>“the only way out is through, and the only way through is forward”</p></li>
<li><p>Internal and External Arguments within and without<a href="#fn0623" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Curse of knowledge, esp re. Music Theory</p></li>
<li><p>What does it mean to succeed at a creation? (reception, viewership, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Inertia (re: my mind sticking to the thought patterns I have at a moment)</p></li>
<li><p>Why I feel the way that I do about the art I create and work on.<a href="#fn0624" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I know that I have a musing somewhere about flavors of truth. Revisit it</p></li>
<li><p>Generally revisit the old blog posts</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Get back into writing the web novel</p></li>
<li><p>Write other fiction. Ideas include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The book I made a document about in late January</p></li>
<li><p>A story told through bullet points</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Other creation ideas (that I’m going to keep here so I don’t lose them and so that maybe someone will steal them and I can consume without having to create)<a href="#fn0625" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref25"><sup>25</sup></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A short film: watching the screen as a breakup letter is written</p></li>

<h1 id="exploring-hesitation-to-restart-web-novel"><a href="why-not-write-web-novel.html">Exploring Hesitation to Restart Web Novel</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2025 March 26</p>
<h1 id="draft-2-26-march-2025">Draft 2: 26 March 2025</h1>
<p>I do really love a good metanarrative, and this blog post might be a good example of one. I was<a href="#fn071" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> wondering why I have not been writing my web novel. I thought that I would<a href="#fn072" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> have the time, energy, and motivation to write another draft yesterday. Instead, 13 hours after leaving home for work, I returned. Everything that I planned to do at home last night took longer than I had assumed it would, and as a result I did not end up writing my chapter.</p>
<p>I forget who initially told me this, but someone once told me that there’s no such thing as free time. That is, anything that I do has to come at the expense of something else that I am otherwise doing.</p>
<p>Somewhere else, I’ve seen that I need to have some amount of my time as rest. For a while, I think that the novel was a form of rest for me, but it absolutely stopped being one by the time that I stopped writing it.</p>
<p>With both of these in mind, it’s obvious to me that I have been less able to do things lately than I was before.<a href="#fn073" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref3"><sup>3</sup></a> If I want to be better about extending grace to myself, I need to make this a question stemming from curiosity, not judgement.<a href="#fn074" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>So, let’s go through the reasons that I might write a web novel, and see how motivating they are to me right now.<a href="#fn075" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>In general, I would love if more of the things that I did were autotelic.<a href="#fn076" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Actually, I don’t know if that’s true. Some use autotelic to mean that a task is undertaken without external goals, and is therefore motivated by the thing itself. It gets to intrinsic and instrumental motivations.</p>
<p>Do I have intrinsic motivation to write?</p>
<p>Broader, do I have intrinsic motivations?</p>
<p>Even broader, is it better for me to have intrinsic motivations?</p>
<p>I guess things which are good in themselves are considered intrinsic motivations. I more and more realize that I think that I subscribe to a version of Divine Command Theory, which means that good is itself an extrinsically defined thing. However, since I also think that goodness is a moral constant, I suppose that practically speaking I can treat things that I do because I believe that they are Divinely ordained as good, and therefore intrinsically valuable. I’ll even go the step further and say that I’m going to use intrinsically motivating as good in itself, where good means I think that it, on the whole, helps to bring the world towards G-d.</p>
<p>Ok, diversion aside, let’s say that an autotelic action is an action I undertake without the explicit or implied belief that I will have an extrinsic benefit from doing it. For me, working out is not an autotelic action, because I exercise to stay in shape. Practicing my guitar is not autotelic, because I do so to be better at guitar. Jamming with a friend is an autotelic action, because the jamming is the goal.<a href="#fn077" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>This helps me think about the book. What would it mean for me to be writing the book as its own end? I think that it would mean that I’m writing it to figure out where the story leads me.<a href="#fn078" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref8"><sup>8</sup></a> That is certainly a motivation I have. The initial premise for the book had the main character becoming a terrorist in the final book.<a href="#fn079" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref9"><sup>9</sup></a> I’m less and less sure how that will happen given the way that the story is playing out right now. In short, I think that there is at least a small part of me that wrote the book and would continue writing the book for its own sake.</p>
<p>Is writing the book a way for me to hone my writing skills? If so, then the motivation to write the book becomes<a href="#fn0710" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref10"><sup>10</sup></a> my motivation for improving my writing skills and my belief that writing the book improves my writing skills. Writing skills are not a monolith, however, and so I should really clarify what it means to improve at writing, at least insomuch as it relates to the book.</p>
<p>I believe that the primary ways the book helps me improve as a writer are that it teaches me to work on a deadline,<a href="#fn0711" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref11"><sup>11</sup></a> it teaches me to write faster,<a href="#fn0712" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref12"><sup>12</sup></a>, it helps me with considering a long narrative and pacing therein<a href="#fn0713" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref13"><sup>13</sup></a>, and it helps me to understand the general human experience.<a href="#fn0714" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>How motivated I am to improve in each of those regards is, as far as I can think of it, a function of how motivated I am to be good at the skill, how good at the skill I currently am, and the rate of progress that I think I will have in improving in the skill.<a href="#fn0715" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref15"><sup>15</sup></a> This means that my overall motivation for writing the book to improve myself is the sum of the motivations to improve each skill multiplied<a href="#fn0716" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref16"><sup>16</sup></a> with the likelihood that I will improve that skill by writing It can be better broken down into the sum of how quickly I think that writing the book will help me with a given skill multiplied by how motivated I am to be good at the skill, divided<a href="#fn0717" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref17"><sup>17</sup></a> by the skill I think that I have, or:</p>
<p>M(Write) = <span class="math inline">∏</span> M(Be good at skill) P(Writing will improve the Skill) E(Speed of improvement by writing)</p>
<p>Where M is the motivation overall, P is the probability, and E is the expectation value, which is itself a function of how easily I train the skill, how good the skill already is, how hard it is to train, and what it means to improve. In general, right now I do think that I am, at least consciously<a href="#fn0718" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref18"><sup>18</sup></a> very motivated to improve at writing. I think that writing the book will absolutely help me with keeping to deadlines, writing quickly, and understanding the human experience. I think that it will be neutral to slightly negative towards my ability to write in the scientific tone, but it might be positive at helping me to develop a specific register for writing, in such a way that I can then change it.</p>
<p>Ok, so the overall motivation appears positive in both regards, and I assume that if I have two positive motivations that they will add. Let’s hope that this will continue to be true, and all reasons I once wrote the book are positive motivators.</p>
<p>The next reason I had to consider was that I was motivated by the idea of making money. That’s really a few motivations hiding in a trench coat and pretending to be the same: the amount that money itself is a motivator, the amount that money is a decent stand-in for how much the external world values something, and the fact that one of the initial reasons I began to publish the book was my belief that I could write something better than the authors who make a lot on the platform. Money itself is not really a motivator for me, I more and more realize. Money as a stand-in for value is something that motivates me decently well, though not much better than anything that money can be exchanged for (pizza, ice cream, a medal).<a href="#fn0719" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Given that the majority of my readers are faceless entities leaving comments on a faceless book, money is really the only way for them to show value. I don’t think that I’m really motivated by the idea that other<a href="#fn0720" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref20"><sup>20</sup></a> authors are making more, because I’ve seen a number of what I consider really well written books also not have a significant monetary value associated on the website, and I’ve seen how much work the authors who turn major profits put into the business side of the writing.</p>
<p>A part of me also worries that being paid to write will make me want to write it less and/or value the book less. Given that I’ve made absolutely no steps towards monetizing the book, I don’t think that’s a motivation I should take into account. Comments are about as meaningful to me as I think that money would be, though there is the secondary point that something people spend money on is something that they’re more likely to recommend to a friend, which would increase my number of comments. All in all, though, I guess that I have to say possibility of monetization is probably just about zero as far as motivations go.</p>
<p>The next motivation I wanted to explore was the fact that I do things in order to prove<a href="#fn0721" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref21"><sup>21</sup></a> that I can. I think that I have effectively proven that I can write a web novel while doing a Ph.D., and I’ve proven that I can write something that others want to read. However, I haven’t proven that I can finish a story or tell a narrative that ends in a way that people like.<a href="#fn0722" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref22"><sup>22</sup></a> There is also the above portion of my motivation to prove that I can write something that others would pay for, but, as discussed, that’s relatively minor, especially since I’ve had comments saying that people are actively looking for a way to pay me. All in all, I’ll say the part of me that refuses to accept limits is a minor motivation at best.</p>
<p>My motivation to write something that my sibling enjoys is not something I’ve considered for a bit. Given the group chat I had with other friends who enjoyed commenting on the book as each new chapter released, I should probably extend it a little further. They all have other things to read which they enjoy, so I don’t really feel like I’m depriving them of much. Then again, I do also love when people like things that I made.<a href="#fn0723" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>And finally, a friend asked me how motivated I was to write the thing because I enjoyed it. That feels like a tough question, and was part of my question for an autotelic action. Does doing something because I think that I’ll enjoy it make it not autotelic? Great question, and one I’ve just reached out to a philosopher friend of mine about.</p>
<p>Ok, so all in all, I do have a fair amount of motivation to start writing the book. I do really believe that on some level the thing that was keeping me from writing was the fact that I didn’t have an explicit reason to point to for why I would. I have that now!</p>
<p>Now comes the hard question: how do I start writing it? I have been and plan to continue to be very busy at work. However, breaks are important, or so I’m told. I do often find that I stick myself into a rut while working, and forcing myself to take breaks is at least one way of confronting that part of me.</p>
<p>How often do I want to publish, how much do I want to be able to revise, how much will I revise, how long will each chapter be, how much of a backlog do I want to start with are all other questions. Let’s answer them now. I want to publish at least once a week, and ideally three times a week again, because I love a MWF release schedule. I would ideally like to be at least 10 chapters ahead so that I can hopefully avoid writing myself into a corner re: making a choice that has bad consequences in three more chapters. I don’t really think that I’ll revise much, in part because I don’t care that much about eking out every possible shred of skill into the book, and in part because a goal is to get better at quickly writing decent text. I want each chapter to be in the 2000 to 2500 word range, but will accept if they are again in the 1800 to 2200 range. I want to start with a ten chapter backlog, because that gives me the revision ability that I had hoped for.</p>
<p>How do I get the next twenty five thousand<a href="#fn0724" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref24"><sup>24</sup></a> words written? I set up time and space to do so. In general, I think that I can and probably should start setting time aside on Sundays again for personal growth related activities. They, like swimming or most things in my life, make every day slightly harder but in return make every day markedly easier.<a href="#fn0725" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>I’m a few weeks behind on keeping up with the living goals, but here it is!</p>
<p>N.B. I’ve decided to have the whole list of goals that I have for the month at the bottom of each posting, and I’ll delete entries as is relevant. That way I can track everything each day!</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Professional:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Thesis Work:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Work on the research within the thesis! Working!</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Be a better mentor: figure out how to take time to help underclassmen as they need help while still getting my own work done. Figured that out!</p></li>
<li><p>Leave work at work. I’ve set boundaries, am following them, and it’s working!</p></li>
<li><p>Work towards future career:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Read the recommended readings about science communication.</p></li>
<li><p>Do the reflections that were recommended to me (mostly focused around why I care about science communication)</p></li>
<li><p>Work on the materials for the science outreach event in April: the handout while they work and a page for the families to take home. Done! I think.</p></li>
<li><p>Figure out the difference between my public-facing and field-facing presentation affects. As I focus on becoming a better presenter, I need to become aware of the difference and how to switch them</p></li>
<li><p>Need to look for jobs</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Health:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Spiritual:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Do the Lenten goals. Haven’t been great about this one. Was doing ok at not listening to things constantly but then had a rough few days and found a new series.</p></li>
<li><p>Be intentional about prayer. That means both making time for prayer and actually doing it. Whoops.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Mental:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clean my Life:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Remove dirt and clutter from physical spaces (standard definition of clean). Doing better!</p></li>

It works wonders</p></li>
<li><p>Work to begin messaging friends.</p></li>

<h1 id="draft-1-25-march-2025">Draft 1: 25 March 2025</h1>
<p>I keep musing within my musings about why it is that I’m not doing my web serial right now. I have a few reasons that have seemed plausible, and so I’m going to explore them as well as anything else that comes up as I muse today. I’ve been very into structuring documents lately<a href="#fn0728" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref28"><sup>28</sup></a>, but I want this to be less structured, if only to force myself out of the happy little boxes that I’m putting myself into.<a href="#fn0729" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>The first and most obvious reason an external observer might have for me no longer keeping up with the book<a href="#fn0730" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref30"><sup>30</sup></a> is the same reason that most people have expressed shock that I was writing a web serial at all: a graduate degree is intense and<a href="#fn0731" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref31"><sup>31</sup></a> all consuming. Especially now that I’m in the thesis writing stage, I really should<a href="#fn0732" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref32"><sup>32</sup></a> be spending a lot of my mental and physical writing space<a href="#fn0733" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref33"><sup>33</sup></a>, if not all of iton the thesis. However, I stopped writing the serial well before I started writing the thesis in earnest, and I was, in fact, able to write it while in a doctoral program, so that can’t be all of it. Whether it’s an actual reason or a convenient excuse I’m using is definitely up for debate, and I’m sure we’ll come back to this in time.</p>
<p>The second reason<a href="#fn0734" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref34"><sup>34</sup></a> that an external observer might use is the death of my mother this past October. Technically speaking, I stopped writing before October<a href="#fn0735" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref35"><sup>35</sup></a>, so that’s not explicitly timeline accurate. Of course, my mother was actively dying in late August, and had been in the hospital for a while before that, when it wasn’t clear if she was going to recover.</p>
<p>The death of my mother does tie neatly into the comment from the first reason: time. Not only was I grieving the loss of one of the pillars of my life, I am<a href="#fn0736" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref36"><sup>36</sup></a> playing catch up, or at least feel like I’m playing catch up for the time that I was less than productive while actively dealing with her dying. Even outside of time, grief is absolutely something that has taken up a lot of my mental space and time. Something that countless authors have spoken<a href="#fn0737" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref37"><sup>37</sup></a> about is the way that grief is almost all consuming at first.</p>
<p>The death of my mother also directly affects the novel for a really key reason that I’m not sure the average external reader would know: she was one of the main reasons that I wrote it. There was a solid month or so that I had to force myself to write each chapter, beginning with typing “the only way out is through, and the only way through is forward. This is something you can do to notably improve your mother’s experience as she deals with her cancer”, deleting it, and then writing the words to the book. When it became clear that she was not, in fact, reading it or likely to be able to read it again, that baseline reason disappeared from the logic. Given that it was, at least allegedly, the sole thing that got me writing for at least a month, the loss of the reason is definitely a big part of the loss of motivation. I think that I had forgotten or blocked out the fact that I used her cancer as an explicit reason to write the book.</p>
<p>Obviously, this ties to another barrier to writing: I associate the book with her and it’s painful to do things that I associate with her, knowing both that I am no longer able to connect with her about them and, maybe more importantly<a href="#fn0738" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref38"><sup>38</sup></a>, that the more I do them without her, the less I’ll associate the actions with her. That’s not just me fearmongering, it’s, as best as I understand it, the state of the field in psychology and neurology. Part of me was, and probably still is,<a href="#fn0739" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref39"><sup>39</sup></a> grasping tightly onto anything that I have that still reminds me of her. Looking at the blank text file where the book once was, or seeing the drafts that are still unwritten, though painful, also makes me immediately think about her. Grasping tightly is never healthy, though, and I think that I’m finally starting to loosen up my grip.<a href="#fn0740" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>I also have the general wall of starting anything.<a href="#fn0741" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref41"><sup>41</sup></a> I’ve taken enough time off of writing that restarting the book is just that, starting again.</p>
<p>Part of me is worried that fans will suddenly hate the way that the book is written.</p>
<p>Part of me knows that so much of the book was written with the general love for life and optimism that I have had for most of my life. I’m beyond terrified at the idea that this optimism, which I have internally as such a key part of my identity, might no longer exist. I also worry that the writing will become darker, and therefore ruin the style that I’ve worked towards.</p>
<p>Part of me knows that the book is, to put it mildly, unique in the writing style. I’ve continued to read about writing style and how to structure prose, and I think that there’s the internal argument within me<a href="#fn0742" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref42"><sup>42</sup></a> between adapting my writing style, and therefore the book, into something more mainstream, the part of me that wants to lean into the uniqueness, and the part of me that wants to not think about the style as I write. Writing that sentence, I know that it’s the exact same issue I have always had with poetry and music.</p>
<p>More than that, though, it’s the same argument that so many pop-adjacent<a href="#fn0743" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref43"><sup>43</sup></a> musicians use for not learning theory. They have a unique sound and don’t want to force themselves into the box that learning theory will do. I always decry this argument as nonsense, because learning new tools is never a bad thing.</p>
<p>However, there is absolutely something to be said about the rubik’s cube dilemma.<a href="#fn0744" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref44"><sup>44</sup></a> That is, once you know how to solve a rubik’s cube, there’s no way to go back and try to derive how to solve it yourself. Or, rather, knowledge changes the way that we see the world.</p>
<p>I know this is true, and have commented on it a lot. There is even a name for this, the <a href="https://psychology.stackexchange.com/questions/3801/what-is-the-name-of-the-cognitive-bias-where-an-expert-overestimates-the-knowled">curse of knowledge</a>.<a href="#fn0745" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref45"><sup>45</sup></a> In music, I feel like I’ve never thought of it as a curse.</p>
<p>Because music is such a universal human behavior, there are countless thinkers<a href="#fn0746" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref46"><sup>46</sup></a> who have put forth their reasons for why the curse of knowledge doesn’t apply to songwriting. In short, the idea tends to be that we all listen to so much music, and our brains are so hard wired to find patterns, that we have internalized most musical rules. Education simply lets us make the choices conscious, rather than unconscious.<a href="#fn0747" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref47"><sup>47</sup></a> There’s also the secondary point that I don’t see a lot of people talk about, which is that most people, especially today, learned their instruments from some sort of system that derives on some level from the academy.<a href="#fn0748" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref48"><sup>48</sup></a> I guess that I’m growing a little less sure of the position that knowledge is not a curse when it comes to finding a voice.</p>
<p>There’s the related but completely independent argument that much creative expression is not solely about using our own voice, but also about sharing it with someone else. If the consumer does not take in what you are trying to convey, were you successful in expression? Even deeper, if the consumer doesn’t consume the product because it’s so off putting to them, were you successful at expressing yourself? In some regards, this ties to the question of why I am writing the web novel.</p>
<p>Is it something autotelic<a href="#fn0749" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref49"><sup>49</sup></a>? Is it, as I’ve mentioned before, a way for me to practice and hone my writing skills? Is it, as I’ve thought about before, something I do with hopes of one day turning a profit? Is it about demonstrating that I can do whatever I set myself to, believing that I am unlimited?<a href="#fn0750" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Is it, as the initial drafts were, about writing something for my older sibling to read? From a friend, is it something that I do because it’s pleasurable?</p>
<p>This feels like a good place to stop the reflection for now, return to work<a href="#fn0751" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref51"><sup>51</sup></a>, and come back to this later.</p>

<li id="fn0718"><p>there’s such a ripe series of musings for me to do about what it means to fight your subconscious. I.e. if there’s something you aren’t doing, there’s clearly some part of you that doesn’t want to do it. There’s a saying I see that people can lie with everything but their habits, which might be relevant here<a href="#fn07ref18" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0719"><p>I have commented a number of times that, much as I love receiving awards and medals, I hate having them (hate might be a strong word, dislike? do not like? hmm) after the fact.

<li id="fn0723"><p>There’s a meme that goes around where someone says something like “when looking at your art, think of it as a cake at a party.

<h1 id="planning-for-lent"><a href="planning-lent-2025.html">Planning For Lent</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2025 March 1</p>
<p><br />
ection<span>Draft 1: 1 March 2025</span> As far as I can tell, I don’t have any musings on Lent.<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Lent comes from the Old English word for spring, which I really appreciate, since so few liturgical words seem to come from English’s roots. Every year I do something different for Lent, based on what I’ve done previous years and where I feel the most spiritual need for growth.</p>
<p>The Church’s default three things to focus on in Lent are: prayer, fasting, and almsgiving. I’ve often seen this expressed as giving something up, taking something on, and doing charity. These two triads are not identical, but they share some similarities.</p>
<p>A quick google search has any number of ideas for how to make Lent more meaningful. One of the sites has the very crucial piece of advice: the thing we give up for Lent shouldn’t be inherently sinful, because we shouldn’t be doing that in the first place. It’s totally fine and good to give something up for Lent with the expressed purpose of returning to it after Lent. That’s something I should keep in mind. Normally I tend to treat Lent as a test run for things which might be healthier for me long term. I’m going to give myself the freedom to also consider giving up or taking on things that I am pretty sure aren’t going to serve me as a new practice.</p>
<p>In the past, I have tended to give up meat and alcohol, both because those are traditional Lenten things<a href="#fn082" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and because they’re parts of my diet that are nice but not necessarily essential. This year, however, I’m really trying to find a way to keep my body nourished, and so I think that anything that puts a block between me and food is probably not a healthy idea<a href="#fn083" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In the past I’ve also added on large prayer plans, but that doesn’t feel as good right now, probably because of how little prayer I have right now. Still, I should add more prayer, both because it’s a thing explicitly recommended in Lent, and also because it’s a goal I’ve had external to that. I think that a decade of a rosary is absolutely a low bar, and something that is at least somewhat meditative, if I do it right. Chaplet of<a href="#fn084" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref4"><sup>4</sup></a> St. Michael is another good one, and I do find the intercessory prayers more powerful in that one, so I might say that as the thing.</p>
<p>Ok so then we have almsgiving. There are just so many places in the world right now that need help, and there are so many ways that I can give time, talent, and treasure<a href="#fn085" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref5"><sup>5</sup></a>. What causes are the nearest and dearest to me?</p>
<p>Honestly, I think that because so much of the focus of catholics around me is entirely on abortion, I find myself more and more looking at the ways that life is hard for mothers. There’s the cheap answer of trying to campaign for maternity leave or better protections for mothers, but that’s basically the same as doing nothing. There’s a charity in town that gives away diapers and other supplies families might need, and that’s probably a safe and good plan. It’s controversial for having formerly<a href="#fn086" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref6"><sup>6</sup></a> been a crisis pregnancy center, and I understand some of the objections that many have to them. However, they are the major provider of aid for new mothers in the area, as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>I have a friend who volunteers at a house for young<a href="#fn087" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref7"><sup>7</sup></a> single mothers. It is also an organization that could always use more resources. For reasons which seem fair, they’re less keen on having men volunteer, but I don’t have to put all my eggs in a single basket. It is important to both give low level aid to many and high level aid to a few. Which is better is ultimately a meaningless question, because we are constantly reminded that anyone we see struggling is Christ.</p>
<p>There’s also the more classic version of almsgiving, and the area certainly doesn’t lack homeless people. One thing that I’ve seen suggested in the past is giving away as much money to others as I spend on myself. Since part of Lent is about giving up pleasures, the fact that it might lead me to spend less on myself is a benefit, as is the reminder of just how many blessings my life is filled with.<a href="#fn088" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>It’s hard for me to feel like giving someone money is not an effective form of charity, even if I understand economies of scale are sometimes helpful, especially for food banks and the like. However, charity is a virtue like all others, and it needs to grow from somewhere. I think that it makes most sense for me to send money to one of the two organizations for mothers and infants, in part because that was something dear to my own mother’s heart. I’ll also think more about volunteering, though I do truthfully feel like I don’t have the time for it right now<a href="#fn089" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref9"><sup>9</sup></a> between everything else that I do.</p>
<p>So we’ve taken on prayer: the chaplet of St. Michael and alms giving: donating at least as much as I spend on myself per week to one of the above organizations as well as giving to the homeless on the street. What am I giving up?</p>
<p>First: games. I spend a lot of time passively wasting on playing logic puzzles, and I don’t think that’s particularly healthy for me. I’ll still play with friends or any non-digital game as it comes up, but solo games are out for the season. Should I give something else up?</p>
<p>I want to stop scrolling social media, so will try once again to stop scrolling. My friends value memes, it’s true, but they value me more than the memes I give them.<a href="#fn0810" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>I think that limited social media and no more games are probably two good things to give up. As I said, giving up meat doesn’t seem like my best bet right now. All said, this seems reasonable to me!</p>
<p>N.B. I’ve decided to have the whole list of goals that I have for the month at the bottom of each posting, and I’ll delete entries as is relevant. That way I can track everything each day!</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Professional:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Thesis Work:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Detailed outline (chapters and section titles at the very minimum) by 18 March. Finished that last night! Can remove.</p></li>
<li><p>Meet with Committee to decide a timeline. Before that, come up with my own idea for one.  Have a timeline of my own, the committee meeting is scheduled, so can remove.</p></li>
<li><p>Work on the research within the thesis!</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Be a better mentor: figure out how to take time to help underclassmen as they need help while still getting my own work done.</p></li>
<li><p>Leave work at work. I’ve been only really thinking about my research this past month, and I can feel it wearing me down rapidly. I’ve started setting some boundaries, so we’ll see if any of them happen</p></li>
<li><p>Work towards future career:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Read the recommended readings about science communication</p></li>
<li><p>Do the reflections that were recommended to me (mostly focused around why I care about science communication)</p></li>
<li><p>Work on the materials for the science outreach event in April: the handout while they work and a page for the families to take home</p></li>
<li><p>Figure out the difference between my public-facing and field-facing presentation affects. As I focus on becoming a better presenter, I need to become aware of the difference and how to switch them</p></li>
<li><p>I was reminded today that part of getting a job in the future requires, shockingly, searching and applying for them, so should start working on that as well</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Health:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Spiritual:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Figure out what I want to do for my Lent. In general, I think I want to give something up, take something on, and find a way to do charity.  Wow look, that’s my musing today! Can remove!</p></li>
<li><p>Do the Lenten goals.</p></li>
<li><p>Be intentional about prayer. That means both making time for prayer and actually doing it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Mental:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clean my Life:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Remove dirt and clutter from physical spaces (standard definition of clean)</p></li>
<li><p>Remove extraneous apps from phone. Done, though I may increase the number of apps I delete. Right now I have the hard issue that some social media apps are my primary way of keeping in touch with some friends. Will have to see what happens</p></li>
<li><p>Spend time each day thinking about the goals for the day, and getting them out of my head and onto the page</p></li>
<li><p>Start reading and returning the library books I have.</p></li>
<li><p>Start to separate the non-work time from work time. I think that, at the very least, I need to say that I will not do work in my apartment. Given that I generally avoid spending much time in there, these two goals should work together. As stated above, made my boundaries as a list, we’ll see if I follow them. Will keep this entry with that in mind.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t waste time, and in particular, be mindful about making sure to take breaks and rest.</p></li>
<li><p>Clean sight lines. Is my space set up in a way that orients me towards my goals for the space? If not, how can I make it so?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Interpersonal Relationships:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Figure out what belongs in a normal letter to a friend.</p></li>
<li><p>Get back into writing letters.</p></li>
<li><p>Upon feeling a sense of dread at receiving a message from someone, remember that my lived experience says that most interactions are positive. More to the point, if my friends didn’t like me, they would tell me or at the very least would not continue to keep me in their life. If alone, speak something to that effect.</p></li>
<li><p>Compile a list of people who are important to me. It does not need to be comprehensive, but ideally would approach that. Have done so! At least for people that I text or otherwise text message and don’t know the timing that I should have with them.</p></li>
<li><p>Figure out the method and frequency of communication I would like to have with them, be that texting, calling, visiting in person, etc. Asked them ! Can remove both of these entries.</p></li>
<li><p>Work to begin doing so.</p></li>
<li><p>Potentially start giving small gifts, though many people also dislike clutter, so think carefully about that one. I’m deleting this, because clutter ain’t great.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Physical:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Go to group fitness classes more regularly and more often.</p></li>
<li><p>Feed myself simply and healthily.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Other:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Music:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Figure out something to work towards on guitar</p></li>
<li><p>Work towards it</p></li>
<li><p>Spend time making efforts to improve as a singer, not simply passively singing.</p></li>
<li><p>Spend time making efforts to improve as a musician, not simply passively growing.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Find the mental block towards writing my web novel</p></li>
<li><p>Write poetry more often, ideally nightly.</p></li>
<li><p>Not only write blogs, but also post them. Ideas include:<a href="#fn0811" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>26 for 26</p></li>
<li><p>Lenten goals. woo! Did it!</p></li>
<li><p>Listening to an album and writing about my experience with it. Unsure if this is best done with one I have prior knowledge of or a new one, but regardless, sit and listen without other stimuli.</p></li>
<li><p>The arts I’ve been doing lately</p></li>
<li><p>Why I care about science and communicating it</p></li>
<li><p>the block between me and my web novel</p></li>
<li><p>My general disposition to authority. I’m not entirely sure what that meant, but it was a note I wrote to myself while half asleep, so I’ll leave it here.</p></li>
<li><p>How to feed myself.</p></li>

<h1 id="reflection-on-the-start-to-the-year"><a href="reflection-february-2025html">Reflection on the Start to the Year</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2025 February 28</p>
<h1 id="draft-2-28-february">Draft 2: 28 February</h1>
<p>As the second month of the year comes to a close, I was reminded by a dear friend that it has been a while since last I updated my blog. The first draft of this post contains more ramblings and ideas, but my ideal blog post<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> is much tighter and cleaner.<a href="#fn092" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Where my writing, like my mind, is meant to ramble, I prefer to have asides in the footnotes. With that in mind<a href="#fn093" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, let’s reflect and, like all interactions, plot towards the future.<a href="#fn094" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Since the year began, I’ve managed to make progress on a fair number of my goals for the year, and possibly more importantly, I’ve also revised my goals for the year, incorporating both more time to think and the lived experiences that I have from attempting them. The only major difference is that I no longer have a goal relating to drawing or art of that kind. More than that, I now know that when I feel as though I should learn to draw, I simply have a short lull in my life, and some activity is soon to require my attention.</p>
<p>As we look towards the next month and period of the year<a href="#fn095" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref5"><sup>5</sup></a>, it seems worthwhile to explicitly state some goals, so that I can reflect on them. Given my inability to write those reflections without finding any number of sidebars<a href="#fn096" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref6"><sup>6</sup></a>, and given that they didn’t appear until at least a few thousand words in, let’s rewrite them. My goals can broadly be grouped into: Professional, Health, Other.<a href="#fn097" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Other is wrong, but I can’t find the word right now to describe the connecting thread for them that doesn’t also mean professional or health related goals.<a href="#fn098" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Professional:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Thesis Work:<a href="#fn099" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Detailed outline (chapters and section titles at the very minimum) by 18 March</p></li>
<li><p>Meet with Committee to decide a timeline. Before that, come up with my own idea for one.</p></li>
<li><p>Work on the research within the thesis!</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Be a better mentor: figure out how to take time to help underclassmen as they need help while still getting my own work done.</p></li>
<li><p>Leave work at work. I’ve been only really thinking about my research this past month, and I can feel it wearing me down rapidly.</p></li>
<li><p>Work towards future career:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Read the recommended readings about science communication</p></li>
<li><p>Do the reflections that were recommended to me (mostly focused around why I care about science communication)</p></li>
<li><p>Work on the materials for the science outreach event in April: the handout while they work and a page for the families to take home</p></li>
<li><p>Figure out the difference between my public-facing and field-facing presentation affects. As I focus on becoming a better presenter, I need to become aware of the difference and how to switch them</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Health:<a href="#fn0910" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Spiritual:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Figure out what I want to do for my Lent. In general, I think I want to give something up, take something on, and find a way to do charity.</p></li>
<li><p>Do the Lenten goals.</p></li>
<li><p>Be intentional about prayer. That means both making time for prayer and actually doing it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Mental:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clean my Life:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Remove dirt and clutter from physical spaces (standard definition of clean)</p></li>
<li><p>Remove extraneous apps from phone</p></li>
<li><p>Spend time each day thinking about the goals for the day, and getting them out of my head and onto the page<a href="#fn0911" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Start reading and returning the library books I have.<a href="#fn0912" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Start to separate the non-work time from work time. I think that, at the very least, I need to say that I will not do work in my apartment. Given that I generally avoid spending much time in there, these two goals should work together.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t waste time, and in particular, be mindful about making sure to take breaks and rest.</p></li>
<li><p>Clean sight lines. Is my space set up in a way that orients me towards my goals for the space? If not, how can I make it so?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Interpersonal Relationships<a href="#fn0913" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Figure out what belongs in a normal letter to a friend.<a href="#fn0914" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Get back into writing letters.</p></li>
<li><p>Upon feeling a sense of dread at receiving a message from someone, remember that my lived experience says that most interactions are positive. More to the point, if my friends didn’t like me, they would tell me or at the very least would not continue to keep me in their life. If alone, speak something to that effect.</p></li>
<li><p>Compile a list of people who are important to me. It does not need to be comprehensive, but ideally would approach that.</p></li>
<li><p>Figure out the method and frequency of communication I would like to have with them, be that texting, calling, visiting in person, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Work to begin doing so.</p></li>
<li><p>Potentially start giving small gifts, though many people also dislike clutter, so think carefully about that one.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Physical:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Go to group fitness classes more regularly and more often.</p></li>
<li><p>Feed myself simply and healthily.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Other:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Music:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Figure out something to work towards on guitar</p></li>
<li><p>Work towards it</p></li>
<li><p>Spend time making efforts to improve as a singer, not simply passively singing.</p></li>
<li><p>Spend time making efforts to improve as a musician, not simply passively growing.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing:<a href="#fn0915" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Find the mental block towards writing my web novel</p></li>
<li><p>Write poetry more often, ideally nightly.</p></li>
<li><p>Not only write blogs, but also post them. Ideas include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>26 for 26</p></li>
<li><p>Lenten goals</p></li>
<li><p>Listening to an album and writing about my experience with it. Unsure if this is best done with one I have prior knowledge of or a new one, but regardless, sit and listen without other stimuli.</p></li>
<li><p>The arts I’ve been doing lately</p></li>
<li><p>Why I care about science and communicating it</p></li>
<li><p>the block between me and my web novel</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Well, when spelled out, that’s both a lot and not many goals at all!</p>
<p>I think that it’s also probably smart for me to break the goals into one-offs and continuing goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Discrete Goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Thesis outline by March 18 for committee meeting.</p></li>
<li><p>Committee Meeting</p></li>
<li><p>Recommended readings about science communication</p></li>
<li><p>Make Lenten goals</p></li>
<li><p>Remove extraneous apps from phone.</p></li>
<li><p>List of people</p></li>
<li><p>Learn how to write a letter</p></li>
<li><p>Find a guitar project</p></li>
<li><p>Find web novel block</p></li>
<li><p>Materials for science expo</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Continuous Goals:<a href="#fn0916" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Thesis research</p></li>
<li><p>Writing my thesis</p></li>
<li><p>Being a better mentor</p></li>
<li><p>Separating work from not-work</p></li>
<li><p>Think about presentation affect</p></li>
<li><p>Pray better</p></li>
<li><p>Eat better</p></li>
<li><p>Write letters</p></li>
<li><p>Reach out to friends</p></li>
<li><p>quiet the voice in me that is nervous</p></li>
<li><p>grow as a musician (guitar, voice, general)</p></li>
<li><p>Write poetry</p></li>
<li><p>Write blogs</p></li>
<li><p>Daily goals/to dos<a href="#fn0917" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Clean home (std meaning)</p></li>
<li><p>Improve aesthetics of spaces</p></li>
<li><p>Be mindful of my time</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Despite how long this list appears, it’s really a very discrete number of things. More importantly, most all of the continuous goals are me attempting to orient myself. That is, rather than trying to get to writing daily poetry, I just want daily poetry to be on my mind going forward. Well, more than 6000 words later, I think that I should call this reflection here.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-28-february">Draft 1: 28 February</h1>
<p>It’s officially the end of the second month of the year. It has been a little over a month since the last time I posted here, and that’s not great, especially given the goals that I’ve had. Let’s use this space<a href="#fn0918" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref18"><sup>18</sup></a> and look through what <a href="planning-2025.html">our goals were</a> for the year<a href="#fn0919" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref19"><sup>19</sup></a> and see how resonant they still are, along with how much I have made progress on them.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the things that I’m excited for this year.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I have a timeline of sorts for my Ph.D, and I’m meeting with my committee soon to see whether they agree with it.</p></li>
<li><p>I think that I’m continuing to grow in my relationships, so that’s really nice.</p></li>
<li><p>I think that there was a typo in the old document, which is kind of fun. I do feel like my faith has continued to be a little touch and go, but hopefully as days get longer and brighter, so too will my outlook.</p></li>
<li><p>I’ve been doing better about feeding myself, though I’m starting to let it slide again. Last weekend’s adventures of traveling to watch a close friend defend his thesis and then returning to help with a chaotic graduate recruiting weekend, while fun, were certainly not conducive to my schedule.</p></li>
<li><p>Finding a way to live with my grief remains a weird thing. I certainly feel like I’m dealing with it better than I was in early January, and like with any pain I have, I find myself compulsively touching it. It’s so weird to realize that I can no longer and never again just text my mom a dumb question that I’ve forgotten the answer to and don’t feel like looking up. When something goes wrong in my life, I can no longer go to her for guidance or comfort. No longer will I hear her tell stories of her childhood and early adulthood.</p>
<p>Despite all that, the pain continues to be duller when I think on these things. I am slowly coming to terms with the reality, much as it really hurts to do so.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Moving on to my January goals, which I’m also going to treat as February goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I don’t think that I’ve done a single piece of album work or touched my accordion since writing that post. Music has been really hard for me lately, both because it’s always an emotional experience and I’ve been trying to repress my emotions and because I can’t separate my memories of sharing music with my mother from any music that I do. Still, this past week or two, I have been playing “I walk the Line” most mornings, so that’s at least some progress back in the direcion of making music.</p></li>
<li><p>I finished the embroidery project! That’s really exciting and great.</p></li>
<li><p>Working on art is something that I very quickly gave up on. Much as I love art, I more and more realize that it is so far down my list of priorities.</p></li>
<li><p>I stopped stretching in the morning and evening, because I’ve started going to yoga<a href="#fn0920" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref20"><sup>20</sup></a>. This week in particular, though, I’ve been exhausted and trying to recover from that<a href="#fn0921" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref21"><sup>21</sup></a>. It’s been really nice to spend 45 minutes in the morning and/or evening working on my flexibility and breath, and while I still absolutely cannot do the movements as naturally as the instructors, I can even more definitely say that I’m getting more flexible.</p></li>
<li><p>I think that I did a personal posting about my food needs? I don’t really remember when the series of posts was, but if it was after January 5, then I guess that I did that! Yay, a goal I finished.</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote four or so letters in four weeks, and then fell off of it. I had set it as a thing I did on the way home from choir, and choir stopped happening for a little bit, so I guess the writing did too. I should really get back into it.</p></li>
<li><p>Journal in the morning. I’ve stopped doing this, along with basically all journalling. I don’t know why, except that I’ve been feeling really driven in my work and nothing else lately. How much of that is repression, how much of that is a genuine drive, and how much is a fear of falling behind, I don’t know.</p></li>
<li><p>I stopped writing poetry, and that’s a shame. I think that I’m going to try to get back into that. I’ve been spending some time most nights crocheting while catching up on my soaps<a href="#fn0922" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref22"><sup>22</sup></a>, and finishing the night off with a little writing would probably serve me well.</p></li>
<li><p>I haven’t been able to touch my webnovel at all. I looked at the comments on the post where I said that I would be taking a hiatus, and the support there was really great. Even thinking about the novel this little bit has made my breath catch<a href="#fn0923" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref23"><sup>23</sup></a>, and that’s something I need to figure out how to work through, because I do think that I still want to finish it? As I typed that, I realized that it wasn’t necessarily true, hence the question mark. That’s something I can and probably should spend some time considering tomorrow.</p></li>
<li><p>Clearly I haven’t been blogging daily. I have written a few posts that I didn’t post though, because they went in directions I didn’t really want to share with the broader world. Still, it’s also good for me to remember how to sanitize my thoughts for broader distribution, especially as we start to head into public talk season.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, with my yearly goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I have made basically no progress on the thesis, though I have done some vague writing on the work I’m doing, which will hopefully make the thesis writing process easier. Still, that’s something I should spend some time on, and that might be a good thing to do while calculations run. At the very least, I want to spend some time making an outline of a thesis.</p></li>
<li><p>Coming to terms with my grief is, in fact, something that I’m doing as best a job on as I think that I can! Woo, finally something else I can unreservedly say that I’ve done well on so far.</p></li>
<li><p>Still working on the sustainability, but I think that there’s significant progress for sure. I’m right now struggling with the fact that I don’t know what I like eating, and my “fifteenth century girl dinner” of a roll, some hard cheese, apples, carrots, and some meat isn’t feeling great any more. I think that a large part of that is as simple as my body’s cues being different right now, and so I need to really figure out what my body needs, regardless of what I hear it saying.</p></li>
<li><p>Not writing the web novel has been very sustainable, unfortunately. I want that to stop being the case, though, which probably means that I would need to take a step back from my research. Given that my groupmates thought that I needed to go home at 2pm yesterday because I seemed completely burnt out, that might be a good idea on its own merits.</p></li>
<li><p>Wasting time has been ebbing and flowing. Generally, I find myself mindlessly browsing the internet far less, and I tend to be doing something with my hands while I watch all the videos that I enjoy consuming. I’ve even started unsubscribing from a number of the content creators that I followed while I needed constant audio stimulation, and will probably continue to winnow down the list. Outside of that, though, I do find that I spend a fair amount of time letting time pass, even if that’s just taking up logic puzzles. With Lent upcoming that could be a great thing to focus on. Instead of spending time playing mindless games, spend time praying.</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote a few letters, but have kind of fallen off of it lately. I would like to get back into that, if only because I love my cage<a href="#fn0924" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref24"><sup>24</sup></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I fell off of journalling, and I don’t know if it really is something that I feel good about lately.<a href="#fn0925" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I thought that I wanted to learn to draw, but more and more I’m realizing I prefer other forms of artistic expression, mostly involving string and yarn. I’m not totally sure why that is, but I’m sure that there are reasons I can consider. Maybe it’s just as simple as the fact that crochet and embroidery<a href="#fn0926" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref26"><sup>26</sup></a> are both so repetitive that I can treat them as meditative in a way that drawing isn’t. The fact that I know far fewer people markedly better at yarn craft than me compared to drawing certainly doesn’t hurt either.</p></li>
<li><p>Finishing the album is something that I’ve made literally no progress on lately. That’s probably ok, though, given how little time I’ve felt like I have had in general lately. I’ve been able to shift my sleep schedule earlier and earlier, which is actually really nice. I love waking up before 6 because my body is rested.<a href="#fn0927" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I joined a new choir,<a href="#fn0928" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref28"><sup>28</sup></a> and I did immediately start writing a piece for it, only to immediately lose energy.</p></li>
<li><p>I’ve been crocheting a lot lately, because I learned that making the flower part of a rose<a href="#fn0929" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref29"><sup>29</sup></a> takes between ten and twenty minutes depending on how well my hands are moving. That’s like the perfect amount of time, and it means that I don’t feel bad if I have to restart, in addition to making it far less likely that I do need to restart.</p></li>
<li><p>I feel like I have dropped accordion from my list of instruments, but am getting more proficiency for sure in guitar. I find myself picking differently to get genre-specific effects, and I can do scales far faster now, for all that I rarely use them. Singing has also been fun. The new choir expects me to sing a G4, so I’ve been once again forced to rely on my head voice/falsetto, and especially the transition between the two. It’s a skill I had developed really well during my time as an undergraduate, where I sang tenor in the early music choir, so it’s been fun to start to get it back. Yesterday, the church choir I sang in moved me down to bass 2, which is only notable because one of our songs this coming Sunday requires a D2. Even though I really struggle with E2 and F2, D2 comes out really well. I think that I’m probably just actively using subharmonics there, but who can say for certain?<a href="#fn0930" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref30"><sup>30</sup></a>.</p>
<p>More than anything, though, all the singing in different styles I’m doing is forcing me to once again remember the way that I have to set my entire vocal structure in order to have different ranges feel singable. I tend to reset on a breath, which makes sense to me, even if I do also wonder if it might be better for me to start trying to be able to do the changes more on the fly.</p></li>
<li><p>My life is absolutely cleaner! My home, while still a mess, is miles better than it has been, and I just find that I’m more and more able to keep my home relatively clean. That is, progress is well ongoing, even though I recognize I have a ways to go.</p></li>
<li><p>Despite it being two of my goals<a href="#fn0931" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref31"><sup>31</sup></a>, I will still not be working on art right now.</p></li>
<li><p>I should really start compiling my list of 26 for 26<a href="#fn0932" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref32"><sup>32</sup></a>. I feel like I’m making progress on it, but without tracking, it can be hard to know for certain.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So, two thousand words in<a href="#fn0933" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref33"><sup>33</sup></a>, what is the summary of my reflection?</p>
<p>I’m generally doing better than I thought I was on my goals, even if I’m doing far worse than the me of early January had hoped.</p>
<p>Before I answer “What do I want to work on in the month of March?”, let’s get some highlights of the past two months out of the way, because focusing on the good is better when framing my future.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Got my talk accepted for a conference!</p></li>
<li><p>Learned how to crochet roses, and got a ton of compliments on them.</p></li>
<li><p>Visited a friend to watch their dance recital<a href="#fn0934" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref34"><sup>34</sup></a> and gift them a hat<a href="#fn0935" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Had a wild interaction with a woman in a club, where she told me that she was dying of cancer and scared for her kids, and I was able to give advice as to what was helpful for me on the other end of the process.</p></li>
<li><p>Started some new medications, which have been really helpful</p></li>
<li><p>Found out what kind of group fitness classes I enjoy</p></li>
<li><p>Helped out with the science bowl again!</p></li>
<li><p>Taught the kids I teach how to binary search<a href="#fn0936" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Read a book that’s been on my TBR since just about as long as I’ve had one<a href="#fn0937" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Learned how to use the high throughput computing cluster at my school, and started using it.</p></li>
<li><p>Baked a lot of bread!</p></li>
<li><p>Made a pork shoulder that was absolutely delicious. Half of it fed me for weeks.</p></li>
<li><p>Went to a close friend’s thesis defense, and was in the acknowledgements!!! That’s quite possibly the first time I’ve been actually cited as a scientific source</p></li>
<li><p>Found out that the research I did in undergrad is not publishable<a href="#fn0938" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Helped out at a recruiting weekend and ended up being looked to to put out a number of<a href="#fn0939" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref39"><sup>39</sup></a> fires.</p></li>
<li><p>Met with my advisor and got a vague timeline for finishing my degree</p></li>
<li><p>Started watching a show weekly with a group of friends</p></li>
<li><p>Started leading my subgroup in weekly meetings and in general</p></li>
<li><p>Met with quite possibly the world’s best chemistry outreach<a href="#fn0940" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref40"><sup>40</sup></a> person and got advice about structuring a talk and really just conversation in general.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Wow, that’s way more than I thought, and I had to go back multiple times to add more and more to the list. Honestly, I feel way better about a lot now that I have that all down there. It is wild to me how much just sitting and reflecting does to make me feel centered, and I do absolutely need to make more of a point of doing so.</p>
<p>Looking into March, what’s on the docket?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Progress on thesis. At the very least, I want to have a detailed outline, where I have the chapters I’m going to write and the major sections within them as titles. Since I’m meeting with my committee in mid March, I should aim to do that sooner than later<a href="#fn0941" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Work on the food situation. With Lent coming up, I usually give up alcohol and meat. I don’t know if I’m going to give up either or both this year, but regardless, I want to focus on food which is more contemplative than mindless, and really make an effort to focus on eating food which is less ultraprocessed.<a href="#fn0942" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref42"><sup>42</sup></a> That is, I want to make sure that I’m feeding myself simply and healthily<a href="#fn0943" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref43"><sup>43</sup></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Figure out what the block is on my web novel. I don’t need to get back into it, but if I realize that it’s not going to come back, then I should accept that. If it is going to be something I pick back up, then I need to figure out what’s stopping me.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t waste time. I think that I’m going to give up playing games for lent<a href="#fn0944" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref44"><sup>44</sup></a>, though I should really reflect on my plans for lent before it starts. I also think that not wasting time can be thought of as not scrolling by social media, and so much more. I know that rest is vital, and so not a waste, but there are ways to rest that are not as brain rotting<a href="#fn0945" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref45"><sup>45</sup></a> as social media. I want to focus on those.</p></li>
<li><p>Writing. I want to, in addition to the thesis and novel, get back into blogging, poetry, and letter writing. The letters I’ve been sending have been really heavy, but letters don’t need to be so. Maybe read an old etiquette<a href="#fn0946" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref46"><sup>46</sup></a> guide on letters to see what used to be normative to include. The letter itself is probably the important part, not the depth of the contents.<a href="#fn0947" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Be better about group fitness classes. Twice a day during the work week is likely too many, but twice per week is definitely too few. As much as I have been enjoying the productivity of morning work, it does leave me crashing by early afternoon, so going to the morning yoga is likely a good option.</p></li>
<li><p>Be better about taking chances on interpersonal relationships. I have a deep seated and frankly irrational fear that many people in my life despise me. The best way to get that part of me to reduce is by forcing it to confront reality. Also, rejection rarely hurts as much as it feels like it will, especially if I don’t irrationally psych myself in any direction.</p></li>
<li><p>Music. I want to make efforts to grow in guitar and voice, not simply passively have them. I also want to get back into listening to music, and think that spending time reflecting on albums could be a good way to do that.</p></li>
<li><p>Continue to clean my life. I want the spaces to be cleaner, but I also want the content to be less cluttered. I do best when I know what’s coming and feel prepared<a href="#fn0948" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref48"><sup>48</sup></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Work on 26 for 26. At the very least, figure out how behind I am.</p></li>
<li><p>Healthy work life balance. I need to not spend every waking moment thinking about work, and I also need to be available as the senior member of my research group when younger students need my help.</p></li>
<li><p>Taking the advice about science communication, revise last year’s outreach talks and prepare for the weekend talk I have coming up.</p></li>
<li><p>Spend a little time each morning either virtually or physically thinking about goals for the day. I don’t know if looking at the goals again at night really helps that much, but if it’s something I have the space to do<a href="#fn0949" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref49"><sup>49</sup></a>, then I might as well try that too.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This set of goals is markedly different than the one at year beginning, and I feel comfortable with the changes. Mostly, they come from me realizing that my priorities are starting to focus on excelling in the areas I care about, rather than trying to become competent at even more areas that I have no true need for.<a href="#fn0950" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>In a slightly more coherent manner, the goals I have for March:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Professional:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Get a working outline of my thesis before committee meeting</p></li>
<li><p>Work on leaving work at work</p></li>
<li><p>Work on being a better mentor</p></li>
<li><p>Work on science communication:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Draft the materials for the science exploration I’m helping to lead</p></li>
<li><p>Read the recommended readings from the meeting and look to how I can incorporate that into the materials I already have</p></li>
<li><p>figure out how to separate my public facing presentation from intra-field communication. The talks need to be different, and I want to make sure I have the affects in my head.</p></li>

<li><p>Physical:<a href="#fn0952" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Feed myself simply and healthily. I think that I should probably start tracking what I eat, at least vaguely, because right now I feel like I don’t feed myself enough, and the fact that my weight is stable means that the calories in and out are equaling each other, and I know that I’m not getting great calories in. I am in a healthy enough mind space right now that I don’t have to settle for simply making sure that I have any fuel, I can work on bettering the fuel.<a href="#fn0953" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref53"><sup>53</sup></a> I know that nutrition is aided by cooking, so figure out what foods I need to cook in order to efficiently extract the nutrition, or other options<a href="#fn0954" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref54"><sup>54</sup></a><a href="#fn0955" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p></li>

<li><p>Mental:</p>

<li><p>Spend time each day thinking about what I want to have happen in the course of the day.</p></li>
<li><p>Work to keep professional and personal things separate<a href="#fn0956" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Don’t waste time, and in particular, be mindful about making sure to take breaks and rest.</p></li>
<li><p>Clean my spaces:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Normal Physical things (kitchen, bathroom, messes on tables)</p></li>
<li><p>Sight lines: are the visuals I have at any given point the ones that I want? Are spaces set up to be conducive to what I want?</p></li>
<li><p>Start reading and returning books<a href="#fn0957" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Honestly, I think that the first two points, if not all three belong in here<a href="#fn0958" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Be more intentional about reaching out to others:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Both figure out what to put in a normal letter and get back into writing them</p></li>
<li><p>When I feel the sudden gut wrenching fear of an unexpected message, stop and verbally<a href="#fn0959" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref59"><sup>59</sup></a> remind myself that I have<a href="#fn0960" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref60"><sup>60</sup></a> good and honest friends who value our relationship like I do,<a href="#fn0961" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref61"><sup>61</sup></a> and much as I like randomly reaching out, some of them do as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Once again compile a list of people who are important to me, and work to start figuring out times and ways to connect with them<a href="#fn0962" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref62"><sup>62</sup></a><a href="#fn0963" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I think those three are good! Maybe start giving small gifts, but that’s something I can do.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Spiritual:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Be more intentional about prayer</p></li>
<li><p>Figure out what I want to do with my lent, and start doing that.<a href="#fn0964" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Artistic:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Work on guitar and voice, not just passively.</p></li>
<li><p>I guess the rest of writing belongs here</p></li>
<li><p>Writing:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Find the web novel mental block</p></li>
<li><p>Start writing poetry again</p></li>
<li><p>Start blogging (and also posting the blogs more)</p></li>
<li><p>26 for 26? This should maybe go somewhere else? idk. Artistic might be the wrong goal. Maybe just “other”</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<p>Woo! We did it! Only 4500 words to vaguely get my point across. Let’s revise this so that i can make it a little easier to follow</p>

<li id="fn091"><p>truthfully, I’d like all my writing to be so, but as someone (I think Twain) said, something something if I had more time I’d have written less<a href="#fn09ref1" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn092"><p>hmm the choice of adjectives I made comes with a lot of connotations. Why is a more concise (the word I forgot) writing cleaner?<a href="#fn09ref2" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn093"><p>wow a lot of w sentences<a href="#fn09ref3" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn094"><p>that metaphor failed, but that’s fine. In general I was thinking how like ripples from a pond you can trace time in both directions. Idk<a href="#fn09ref4" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn099"><p>I do love nested lists, and nested things generally, as a group member pointed out (about my code)<a href="#fn09ref9" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0910"><p>I break into physical, mental, and spiritual, not because I think that I am these three discrete things, but because I think most of my goals primarily target one of the three aspects of me, and the effects that they have on the rest of me are harder to quantify (not that all goals need to be quantifiable)<a href="#fn09ref10" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0911"><p>be it physical or digital<a href="#fn09ref11" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0912"><p>elements of this hit professional, because it is potentially part of the thesis work<a href="#fn09ref12" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0913"><p>are essential to my mental health, and I know this<a href="#fn09ref13" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0914"><p>even ignoring that not everyone and I had a deep connection over my mom dying, that’s only good for a single letter I think. Also, I want them to be potentially light, rather than always heavy. “Hi Friend, I love you and hope you’re doing well” is not a heavy statement, but feels lacking to me for a letter. Whether that’s a personal issue or actually advisable, who knows? not me yet!<a href="#fn09ref14" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0915"><p>other than letters and daily notes, as in health or the professional ones in professional<a href="#fn09ref15" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0916"><p>meaning, not planning to finish in March, even if they can be explicitly finished<a href="#fn09ref16" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0917"><p>Hmm I don’t have a good mental distinction between the two. Should I?<a href="#fn09ref17" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0918"><p>digital, and also the time that I have right now (spacetime is a thing! That means space is interchangeable with time)<a href="#fn09ref18" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0919"><p>and also January<a href="#fn09ref19" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0920"><p>conveniently hitting the second point<a href="#fn09ref20" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0921"><p>not eating well probably doesn’t help that fact, but<a href="#fn09ref21" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0922"><p>read: the youtubers I enjoy or whatever audiobook I’m listening to<a href="#fn09ref22" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0923"><p>not in a good way<a href="#fn09ref23" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0924"><p>the space I have reserved in the library is very cage-like<a href="#fn09ref24" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0925"><p>as I’ve been writing this, I’ve also been catching up on text with friends, and remembering the correct usage of full stops is always a fun journey when swapping between the two back and forth<a href="#fn09ref25" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0926"><p>at least the way I do them<a href="#fn09ref26" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0927"><p>wow this reflection is getting rambly faster than I would have expected (rambley? spell checker dislikes both and googling (I had a moment of “I don’t use google or to support it”., then remembered brand dilution is a thing) doesn’t seem to immediately treat either as a word<a href="#fn09ref27" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0928"><p>TTBB! My first ever I realize<a href="#fn09ref28" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0929"><p>not the stem or calyx (which is a term crochet embroidery pattern makers feel wayyy too loose in using, imo)<a href="#fn09ref29" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0930"><p>me, if I bothered to pay attention<a href="#fn09ref30" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0931"><p>whoops<a href="#fn09ref31" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0932"><p>which is a blog post I should do<a href="#fn09ref32" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0933"><p>hey cool, my writing pace is still around 2k an hour, which is right around 30 a minute. Given that I have to think about what I’m going to write, along with the fact that I’ve been multitasking and correcting all my errors, I’m really happy with that<a href="#fn09ref33" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0934"><p>they were, unsurprisingly, fantastic<a href="#fn09ref34" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0935"><p>which I did, in fact finish after the recital but before I left<a href="#fn09ref35" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0936"><p>no, that was not connected to the theology in any way, shape, or form<a href="#fn09ref36" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0937"><p>and, wildly, it was really great. One review put it nicely “it shouldn’t have been as enjoyable as it was”, since it did really have a pretty predictable and generic plot, caricatures of characters (ooh that’s a great line, I need to do something with that in the future), and the outdated sexual morals of the 1970s (consent is much different now)<a href="#fn09ref37" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0938"><p>not so much we got scooped as the field came to the knowledge as a whole<a href="#fn09ref38" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0939"><p>thankfully metaphorical<a href="#fn09ref39" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0940"><p>he’d say public engagement, and I agree with his points<a href="#fn09ref40" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0941"><p>i.e. probably today in between reviewing documents with the group<a href="#fn09ref41" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0942"><p>Deep down, this feels like something related to spirituality, but for the life of me, I cannot find the words to describe how<a href="#fn09ref42" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0943"><p>ah yeah simple is probably what I meant<a href="#fn09ref43" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0944"><p>in the sense of video games to pass the time, not in the sense of any shared experience with people<a href="#fn09ref44" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0945"><p>I think that’s a new phrase but<a href="#fn09ref45" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0946"><p>wow I had no idea where the t’s in that word went<a href="#fn09ref46" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0947"><p>that feels wrong to say, but I am in general struggling to find the words to express myself. That’s part of why I want to get back into journaling and poetry<a href="#fn09ref47" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0948"><p>once again the wrong word, but like I feel better when I have a journal with me, regardless of my intention to write<a href="#fn09ref48" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0949"><p>mentally and emotionally<a href="#fn09ref49" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0950"><p>Drawing is really the big one here. I don’t care about it when I don’t have time, and when I do have time, I do. That’s interesting enough, and is probably something I can keep in mind as I move forward in life. The more space I have, the more I care about learning to draw<a href="#fn09ref50" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0951"><p>retroactively placed above artistic after first point there because I was (am as of right now) unsure whether I should put writing there. Why I don’t think of writing as artistic is a question for another time<a href="#fn09ref51" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0952"><p>yes, I realize that I am not a mind, body, and soul as three distinct parts, but it does help me to think of the driving reason behind each. Secondary effects are not primary<a href="#fn09ref52" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0953"><p>there’s a post that I’ve seen that means a lot to me talking about how there’s no bad calories, and also that potatoes are not great in spite of caloric density, but in part because of it<a href="#fn09ref53" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0954"><p>acids??<a href="#fn09ref54" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0955"><p>oof this is getting rambly<a href="#fn09ref55" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0956"><p>in that like I want to be able to mindfully take breaks<a href="#fn09ref56" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0957"><p>this is kinda new buttttt<a href="#fn09ref57" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0958"><p>if we redraft, move them down here<a href="#fn09ref58" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0959"><p>if alone<a href="#fn09ref59" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0960"><p>probably, though that’s something I shouldn’t say there. Hmm what is something that I can say that feels true and is helpful (this was initially going to be followed by wronged, but the new one is better)<a href="#fn09ref60" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0961"><p>like not necessarily meaning to the same degree, because that’s not important<a href="#fn09ref61" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0962"><p>obviously make sure they agree with the goals, but for now make it aspirational<a href="#fn09ref62" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0963"><p>ooof helping one of the fellow students in my group with a coding issue really took me out of this. The next like 600 words I spent describing the difference between how I feel also did<a href="#fn09ref63" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0964"><p>taking a break here for work with the group. Returning: let’s keep going<a href="#fn09ref64" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
