<p>First Published: 2022 October 20</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>By recommendation,<a href="#fn001" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I listened to James Clear’s <em>Atomic Habits</em> today on a long drive.<a href="#fn002" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> It’s a book which uses anecdote and scientific evidence to help build the habits we want in our life. Like every other self-help book I read by pseudo-scientific men who started out blogging,<a href="#fn003" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> it uses the example of compounding interest, and how small percent differences become massive over time. Unlike others, he really emphasizes how you’re completely unlikely to see any of the gains until after you’ve fully established a habit, which is nice.</p>
<p>Another good part of the book is that he makes a point of the fact that habits don’t form out of nowhere. Whether it’s a net good for our overall life or not, any habit we start is started, on some level, at least, because it’s improving our immediate environment.</p>
<p>The advice seems good and practical, which is somewhat uncommon in these sorts of books. There’s also good mention of survivorship bias, which is often lacking in the genre. Overall, it’s a really enjoyable read, and doesn’t suffer from the same page-length padding common to the genre. It’s a quick read that I’d recommend!</p>

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Wow! Two months ago today I <a href="sharing-a-song">talked about when I shared a song I wrote</a>. It’s so weird to me how in those two months I went from terrified of playing a song in front of a single friend to willing to just play a half-finished song at an open mic.</p>
<p>However, it was generally well received, and it was fun to have the band back together.<a href="#fn011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>2 Timothy 4:2 “proclaim the word; be persistent whether it is convenient or inconvenient; convince, reprimand, encourage through all patience and teaching”</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today’s readings remind us of the Gospel admonition to pray ceaselessly. More than that, though, we are reminded of how our faith lives do not affect us alone.</p>
<p>When Moses lowers his hands from exhaustion, it is not only he who suffers. All of Israel is pushed back. And yet, we do not have to fight alone. When he grows weary, Aaron and Hur support his arms.</p>
<p>We are also reminded of how, if we truly are living solely for Christ, our actions would be. How often in our day to day lives do we stand obstinately in the face of some inconvenience to us? How much worse is an eternity without the Lord, either for us or for those around?</p>

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Well, I have once again fallen behind on both poems and writing blog posts.<a href="#fn031" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> There’s a Tumblr page that posts weekly prompts for short writings, and last Friday I responded to it with a poem. I kind of like the idea of continuing to do that, and sonnet form is starting to get boring to me.</p>
<p>So, it feels like a good time to break back out villanelles. I’ve written about them <a href="on-villanelles.html">before</a>, but they remain a fascinating poetic form to me, for all that they’re significantly harder to write.</p>

<p>Yesterday I gave the <a href="talk-planning-1.html">talk</a> <a href="talk-planning-2.html">that</a> <a href="talk-planning-3.html">I’ve</a> <a href="talk-planning-4.html">been</a> talking about for a while. I think it went well, and I got mostly positive feedback.

<p>Still, it happened!</p>

<h1 id="theology-question"><a href="theology-question.html">Theology Question</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 October 5</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Currently I’m struggling with a theology question. Apparently animals don’t have immortal souls. So far as I can tell, we know this to be true that because:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>St. Thomas Aquinas said so</p></li>
<li><p>The Church has generally agreed about it</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Neither of those is sufficient in my mind to require my submission.</p>
<p>My logic for why I would believe animals have souls which go to heaven is<a href="#fn051" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> a relatively straightforward logical chain.<a href="#fn052" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Prior to Original Sin there was no death</p></li>
<li><p>We die because our ancestors, Adam and Eve, committed the sin, and we inherit it as their children. This has been stated by a Pope as necessary to belief, though in the context of whether we can believe humanity sprang from multiple sources.</p></li>
<li><p>There were animals in the Garden</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There are only a few conclusions I can draw from this chain. Either:<a href="#fn053" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>There was death before Original Sin, and that Bible verse means something different in context/doesn’t exist.<a href="#fn054" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>We have dominion over other animals, so when we became mortal, so did they. Lacking anything else immortal, they were then condemned to destruction</p></li>
<li><p>The Lord chose to create beings that would die in the Garden</p></li>
<li><p>When we were forced out of the Garden, the Lord created new animals which were mortal and lacked souls</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Anyways, fixing my router just now took out most of my interest in solving my theological quandry, so off it goes into the ether of thoughts I sometimes have. I may revisit this some other time.</p>

<p>First Published: 2022 October 3</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>I mentioned <a href="twenty-four.html">recently</a> that I learned how to repair an accordion. I don’t know if I’ve mentioned here yet that I own an accordion, but I do.</p>
<p>More or less, one row of the bass reeds had fallen into the bellows of my instrument.<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Now that I know how to, fixing it is as simple as opening the bass side up by removing six pins and slotting the row back into place. However, I did not know that at the time, and ended up spending around two hours to get to that point of knowledge. I’m glad for the mistakes I made, because they’ll help me do better in the future!</p>

<h1 id="reflections-on-todays-gospel"><a href="reflections-on-readings-27-ordinary-c-22.html">Reflections on Today’s Gospel</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 October 2</p>
<p>Habakkuk 1:2a “How long, O LORD, must I cry for help and you do not listen?”</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today’s readings call us to remember the cost of discipleship. These are not the costs that have been coming up in prior weeks: temporal pain and hatred, loss of material wealth, and so on. Instead, these readings remind us that the Lord’s ways are mysterious, and we are called to remain steadfast in spite of, and perhaps due to the trials of faith.</p>
<p>Habakkuk asks the same question that has plagued non-believers for ages: if the Lord is all-good and all-powerful, why is there suffering in the world? More to the point, why is there suffering among the faithful. I’m sure we can all understand how the Lord, especially as seen in the Old Covenant, would allow suffering for the faithless, but why the faithful.</p>
<p>These readings don’t seek to answer that question. We are given pieces of it, certainly, as in the Psalm, where the response calls us to keep from hardening our heart when the Lord speaks. We are directly compared to the Israelites at Meribah, where they questioned the Lord’s goodness even as he brought water from stone. As ridiculous as it seems to be dubious in the face of such an obvious miracle, how often does that happen to us?</p>
<p>White light sent through a lens diffracts into a rainbow of colors because each wavelength moves slightly differently through a medium. How wonderful is it that we were given such a world to work in, where we can see what colors everything shining are made of? How often do we forget the beauty in the natural world because it’s been buried under layers of dry material?</p>
<p>Christ himself tells us in the Gospel that even when we do all that we are commanded, that is no cause for reward. Instead, we have merely done what is expected of us. In what we are expected to do is see the Lord’s Creation without a hardness of heart. Seeing the beauty of the world He created is certainly something that I need to work on.</p>

<p>Hooray! We made it another month.</p>
<p>My goals were:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Blog daily</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch daily</p></li>
<li><p>Manage to run the entire doctoral dash</p></li>
<li><p>Continue keeping up with my BiaY buddy</p></li>
<li><p>Write a poem every day</p></li>
<li><p>Journal every day</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Lets see how we did:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Nope! I wrote 12 blog posts. Oof.</p></li>
<li><p>Again, I stretched maybe once.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="running-1.html">I did it!</a> Woo! It was kind of fun in retrospect.</p></li>
<li><p>I’m now something like 60 days behind oof.</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote 10 sonnets, and started another song. Let’s call that an even dozen.</p></li>
<li><p>I didn’t journal even once. Whoops.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Moving forward into next month:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Blog daily. Eventually this goal will happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch daily. I’m going to stretch right after this, just so I make sure to do it.</p></li>
<li><p>Figure out how to repair/improve my accordion case. I made some notes today, and I think I should be able to get some of it done by the end of the month.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a poem every day. I did feel like the poems I wrote helped me ease into sleep, and they certainly help me write songs better.</p></li>
<li><p>Finish the newest song I’m working on.</p></li>
<li><p>Make progress on catching up for BiaY.</p></li>
<li><p>Fill in at least 3 more items on my 24 for 24.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>That seems like a nice set of goals. Let’s see how it goes!</p>

<h1 id="performing-a-song"><a href="performing-a-song.html">Performing a Song</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 September 26</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As I mentioned <a href="sharing-a-song.html">about a month ago</a>, I wrote and shared a song with some friends. Last Monday, I performed the song for the first time in public. It was a good time, even though it didn’t go exactly how I’d hoped.</p>
<p>That is, the tempo got a little messed up between me and the other band members, and the mic placement wasn’t quite right. Still it was very rewarding to share something I wrote, as terrifying as it is. After the show, I realized that the concern I had about being booed was completely unrealistic. Even if the song had been horrible<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, the vibes at the open mic are very supportive generally.</p>
<p>The song was reviewed as incredibly sad, which is a little funny to me as I think about it more. Certainly the lyrics are sad, and I performed it in a sad way<a href="#fn092" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, but when played, even at tempo, on an accordion or piano, it’s very clear that the piece is just in a standard major key. My friends told me it was enjoyable, and that’s nice.</p>
<p>One of them sent me a message after the show saying that it was brave of me to play the song, which was nice. Anyways, I’m excited to keep playing with this band in the future.<a href="#fn093" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
