<p>First Published: 2023 December 25</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>This is now <a href="christmas-2018.html">my</a> <a href="christmas-2022.html">third</a> musing on Christmas. As with the other two, I’m publishing it on Christmas Day.<a href="#fn001" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>My previous musings about Christmas have been fairly short. The first<a href="#fn002" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> was four sentences. Half of those were less than four words a piece.<a href="#fn003" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> The second was a little longer, but focused almost exclusively on the liturgical readings.</p>
<p>Today, I’d like to focus a little on the traditions that my family has kept. As I grow older, I find that I’ve been thinking a lot more about what parts of my life I’d like to keep forever, what parts I wish never happened, and what I think served its purpose and is no longer needed.</p>
<p>Our Christmas mornings tend to start with cinnamon rolls. This past Thanksgiving, my little brother<a href="#fn004" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> and I realized that we both had fond memories of orange rolls as children. We still are not entirely certain which family member we had the rolls for,<a href="#fn005" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> but we do know why we stopped having them. In short, none of the extant adults in my family like them.<a href="#fn006" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> I did not remember that, however, and got orange rolls for the morning after Thanksgiving.<a href="#fn007" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> My little brother and I loved them, and so this year’s Christmas morning breakfast also included orange rolls.<a href="#fn008" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Moving slightly back in the chronology, we get matching pajamas as a family every year. We open them on Christmas Eve, and then we all wear them on Christmas day. A related tradition: the children take a photo with Santa every year. Once we reached an age that it stopped seeming reasonable to go to the Santa in town,<a href="#fn009" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> we started taking them as a family on Christmas morning. We’ve now merged the two traditions, and it’s really fun getting to look back and see the siblings in matching clothes.</p>
<p>We do a gift exchange after the photos<a href="#fn0010" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>, and then we make a quick breakfast and eat it. After that, we play a board game.<a href="#fn0011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> By that point, we’re all tired of each other<a href="#fn0012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>, so we tend to be free until dinner. For some reason, I have no memories of what we historically eat for Christmas dinner.</p>
<p>All in all, I love the fact that my family’s Christmas is what it is. I’m sure that at least some portion of my attachment to the traditions comes from the fact that they’re the traditions that we have. If I had grown with others, I am sure that I would have loved them just as much.<a href="#fn0013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I embroider today? I plotted out the next embroidery project I want to work on. Unfortunately, I did not start on it until 2100, and that is far too late to start embroidering for the day. Maybe tomorrow.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I play guitar today? Just a touch! But I did enjoy the amount that I did.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I practice touch typing today? I made it all the way to Q! It bothers me more than a little that the last letter we get is J, but as soon as I make it through the Q, I’m through all the letters at at least 50 wpm, which means that it becomes time to reset the goal with much higher wpm. Probably closer to 70, since that really is my goal speed. Then again, it isn’t really like I need to be able to type q at 70 wpm, since most of the time I won’t need it. B is the big issue letter today<a href="#fn0014" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>, so at least that’s progress, since C no longer is a struggle for me I guess.</p>
<p>Update a few minutes later, I’ve officially gotten the entire alphabet at 50 words per minute. Now it’s time to up the goal to 75 and see what happens. Ooh cool! It saves my progress, so now I just had to restart with A, and then go to Y. That’s pretty fun. I am wondering whether it might be in my best interest to set the intermediate goal a little lower. Idk.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Reading</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have I made progress on my Currently Reading Shelf? Nope! But that’s ok! I spent the day with my family instead.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I read the book on craft? Shoot! Hopefully tomorrow.</p></li>
<li><p>Have I read the library books? Not even a little. Let’s see if we cannot do more of that next month in particular. I feel like my schedule doesn’t really exist when I’m at home.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write a sonnet? I wrote one yesterday, and I’m going to take today off from writing one, since it’s very late out, and I would rather sleep.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? Another day where I’m not thrilled with the quality, but that’s life, I suppose.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write ahead on Jeb? It’s Christmas, so that’s obviously not happening either.</p></li>
<li><p>Letter to friends? I sent all the Christmas notes, and I had some good conversations with friends.</p></li>
<li><p>Paper? It remains a holy day.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Wellness</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How well did I pray? Not great.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I spend my time well? I think so!</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? No. Sad.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I exercise? Shockingly! A little, if only because there were some activities today.</p></li>
<li><p>Water? I drank water to the point that I no longer wanted it today! I’m very proud of myself.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>This is now <a href="christmas-2018.html">my</a> <a href="christmas-2022.html">third</a> musing on Christmas. As with the other two, I’m publishing it on Christmas Day.<a href="#fn0015" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> Apparently both of my musings on Christmas have been fairly short.</p>
<p>My initial musing, published in the initial iteration of this blog, was four sentences, half of which were under four words. My musing last year, being a combined Christmas and Reflection on Readings, was a little longer, and focused more on the liturgical aspect of the season.</p>
<p>This year, however, I am writing this musing early enough that I have time to actually think,<a href="#fn0016" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> and not on a Sunday.<a href="#fn0017" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> As a result, I find that I have more time to consider what I want to muse about.</p>
<p>So, what do I want to muse about? The book on the craft of writing suggests that it’s best to plan to spend half the time you have allotted to an essay on planning and half on actually writing. I don’t think that will be a part of my life for a while, but let’s try some of what they suggest.</p>
<p>One piece of advice was to do some free association. Christmas to Christmas movies to Scrooge. Christmas, advent, awaiting, Christmas, stockings, family, loved ones.</p>
<p>OK my mind doesn’t do free word association well right now.<a href="#fn0018" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>What are things that I did today?</p>
<p>Texted wishes for a happy Christmas to friends<a href="#fn0019" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>, and had some nice digital conversations with them. I spent time with family, which was lovely as always!<a href="#fn0020" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> In particular, we played games as a family, had some meals together, and did a small gift exchange.</p>
<p>I’ve started writing this musing, which is something. I honestly think that may be literally everything that I’ve done today. Ok so maybe musing about today as a thing isn’t a great idea. My family’s reaction to me saying who all I was texting today makes me think a musing about that might not be welcome either.</p>
<p>That’s really it for today. So, let’s think about what Christmas in general means to me? Let’s see what that sparks. I guess the question is if I want to focus on the cultural or religious connotations that Christmas has for me.<a href="#fn0021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>Having now made, eaten, and cleaned up from dinner, there’s probably something I can muse about combining my post about family recipes, the fact that we only use red potatoes for mashed potatoes, and the fact that no one on the internet will say they’re meant for that. However, I don’t really know if I can connect that to Christmas, especially today. It might be a good idea to think more about it for future musings about family recipes.</p>
<p>Ok so let’s try to make a coherent draft. I still haven’t figured out what I want to muse about. The writing book says that you should spend a few days on this process, but acknowledges that you may not always have the option to do so.</p>
<p>Christmas. What’s it about? No that feels too trite and over done.</p>
<p>Christmas. Fears that I have related to it? Feels too personal to this blog.</p>
<p>Christmas. Why is it so hot out today? Could be good.</p>
<p>Christmas. Changes?</p>
<p>Hmmm. What can we talk about for changes?</p>
<p>There’s the obvious, that the weather is changing as the climate gets worse. There’s the way that family traditions change. There’s the voice in my head that says this might be the last Christmas we have together.<a href="#fn0022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> There’s the fact that life hasn’t really returned to a stasis since Covid? Idk let’s see what happens if we just go like that.</p>

<h1 id="reflections-on-todays-gospel"><a href="reflections-on-readings-4-advent-b-23.html">Reflections on Today’s Gospel</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 December 24</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>Today is the Fourth Sunday of Advent. It’s a strange set of readings, especially when we look at the readings that we have had for the past few weeks. The first reading, as expected, is a reading from the Old Testament. Unlike most of the other readings, today’s does not come from one of the explicitly prophetic books. Instead, we have an excerpt<a href="#fn011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> from the Second Book of Samuel. We follow David, who wants to build the Ark of the Covenant a better dwelling place.</p>
<p>Of course, as Catholics, we know that the Ark was a foreshadowing of Mary, who carried the Christ into the world.<a href="#fn012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> And so, it’s only fitting that the Gospel today focus on Mary. In particular, we see one thread continuing from the time of David the king to the time of Christ the King: The Almighty’s angels. The Angel Gabriel delivers messages both to David and to Mary. And so, in the final hours before Christmas<a href="#fn013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, I think it’s good to reflect on what Mary said to the Angel of the Most High, “may it be done unto me according to your word.”<a href="#fn014" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> The Pater Noster may be the perfect form of prayer, but Mary’s Fiat<a href="#fn015" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> is bound to be a close second. David wanted to build a fitting home for the Ark, but did not know what to ask.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I embroider today? I realized that I actually want to learn the stylistic aspects so tried to recharge a device that would let me plot out my embroidery. I charged it, but that’s as far as I got.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I play guitar today? I did! Even jammed with my brother for a little bit<a href="#fn016" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Did I practice touch typing today? I made it through B! Have to repeat P again tomorrow, but that’s a task for future me.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Reading</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have I made progress on my Currently Reading Shelf? I finished the currently reading book from the library, now I just need to finish the rest of the books that I’m reading.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I read the book on craft? I read! Only about twenty pages. If I want to finish the book by the end of the month<a href="#fn017" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>, I need to read a little more quickly. It’s really fascinating how much I feel like I learn in every word. I’m also glad to know that the authors agree with me that there are no perfect synonyms.</p></li>
<li><p>Have I read the library books? Oh gosh, there’s no chance at all that I finish the books in time. If I start reading just far too much, it would be possible for me to make it through, but it would mean that I kind of cannot do anything else.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write a sonnet? I feel bad about the amount of time that I’ve taken off from this goal. Let’s go write one right now.<a href="#fn018" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Did I revise a sonnet? Revision no longer feels needed. I’m going to delete it starting tomorrow.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? I’m not thrilled with this musing, but I don’t have the mental space to keep trying.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write ahead on Jeb? Sunday which is obviously a day off.</p></li>
<li><p>Letter to friends? I wrote out the Christmas notes that I want to send.</p></li>
<li><p>Paper? It’s a holiday.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Wellness</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How well did I pray? I went to two Masses, which means that there was at least a little bit of prayer.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I spend my time well? Pretty well! I spent it with family, which is really nice.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? I am regretting the fact that I don’t, and I need to find a way to fit it into my life from now on.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I exercise? See the prior item.</p></li>
<li><p>Water? I drank more water, if only because my voice kept breaking at my first mass.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>It’s the fourth Sunday of Advent, and it almost feels like Christmas.<a href="#fn019" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Today’s readings were pretty standard “be ready for Christmas” readings. The first reading comes from the Second book of Samuel, where we see David trying to pay homage to his Lord. He looks around, realizing that he lives in a beautiful home, while the Lord is being kept in a tent. The prophet of the day<a href="#fn0110" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> assures him that the Lord will appreciate any efforts that Daniel puts forth.</p>
<p>The Lord, however, comes to Nathan in a dream,<a href="#fn0111" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> and tells him to tell Daniel not to build a temple. More than that, though, the Lord says that he will establish an eternal kingdom from David’s descendants. As Catholics, we know what that kingdom is, and who the heir is. The Gospel, of course, makes that explicit.</p>
<p>The angel<a href="#fn0112" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Gabriel<a href="#fn0113" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> comes to Mary. Importantly, he is the same angel who came to Daniel to interpret his visions. It’s something that very rarely comes up in homilies that I’ve heard, probably for some good reason.</p>
<p>Of course, one reason could very easily just be that the Ave Maria<a href="#fn0114" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> is allegedly a very unpopular prayer among Protestants.<a href="#fn0115" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> The fact that the opening line comes directly from an angel<a href="#fn0116" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> of the Lord should, in theory, help assuage concerns about the prayer. Then again, I don’t know if anyone attending Mass on the Fourth Sunday of Advent<a href="#fn0117" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> needs to be convinced that Mary is a good and holy person, worthy of admiration.<a href="#fn0118" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Advent in general, as the priest today reminded us, is a season focused on Mary. It feels a little strange to me that we only really care about the last month of Mary’s pregnancy, but I suppose that otherwise we’d have to start Advent as soon as Easter ended.<a href="#fn0119" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> I’m sure there’s something to think about in the fact that we only really talk about Christ as a newborn child and as a thirty three year old. It is a little strange to think that, were I Christ, nothing that I’ve really done with my life so far would have been recorded.</p>
<p>Post writing note: I’m not really happy with the musing right now, for all that I don’t really know what else there is to reflect on in the readings. Maybe I should come back to this in a little bit?</p>
<section class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
<hr />

<li id="fn011" role="doc-endnote"><p>I mean technically like 5 excerpts, given that the reading comes in many parts<a href="#fn01ref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn012" role="doc-endnote"><p>Ok, so here’s my inane question for the day: Christ means anointed. Is there a historical moment where He was anointed?

<h1 id="on-family-recipes"><a href="family-recipes.html">On Family Recipes</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 December 23</p>
<h1 id="draft-3-december-23">Draft 3: December 23</h1>
<p>Holidays are a time to remember. For many, it is a time when the entire family shows up in the same space to share a meal and fellowship. Traditions form as people bond to a specific food or ritual. As older members die and newer people join the family, traditions mutate and change.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, traditions last until they are questioned. I’m reminded of one from my own family, where we used to trim the ends off of each roast before cooking. When we finally reconstructed the narrative, it turned out that the only roasting pan one of the family owned was too small for the roasts. Even as we got larger pans, however, we continued trimming the roast.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I was reminded of this as I prepared the only family recipe I get from my mother’s half of the family. Now, earlier drafts<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> focused far more on the specific dish. I think that it’s worth taking a step back and thinking more about what family recipes tell us in general.</p>
<p>Until just a few years ago, for instance, I thought that we had a family recipe for green bean casserole. In some regards we do. We prepare the meal the same way, and it’s a recipe we use for every important meal.<a href="#fn022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> However, it turns out that the recipe we follow comes directly from the French’s Fried Onion box.</p>
<p>I have read a number of so called family recipes that adapt<a href="#fn023" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> from a recipe book that someone’s mother or grandmother or aunt read. In the times before the internet, it was difficult to source information. If someone brought a dish you liked, asking them for a recipe would not necessarily come with the recipe’s provenance.</p>
<p>Honestly, my mind is blank today, and I do not know what else I could say. I’m sure that there’s more I could muse on, but I don’t know what.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I embroider today? I still haven’t figured out who I’d give the gift to, though I do like the last design I made. It could be fun to just make more letters.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I play guitar today? Just for a moment! It was fun, and I’m starting to enjoy E Major as a chord, for all that I still dislike B Major.<a href="#fn024" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Did I practice touch typing today? I did! I made it through P and am now ready to start on B tomorrow. I was once again stopped on c for a bit, which isn’t fantastic, but it is what it is.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Reading</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have I made progress on my Currently Reading Shelf? One of my library books is due soon, so I’m working to finish it tonish.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I read the book on craft? Today flew past sadly.</p></li>
<li><p>Have I read the library books? nope!</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write a sonnet? Did not write one yesterday, will also not make one today.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I revise a sonnet? Still no</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? Eh, mostly yesterday, but</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write ahead on Jeb? Today is one of the days off.</p></li>
<li><p>Letter to friends? Started plotting some letters to friends.</p></li>
<li><p>Paper? Break day.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Wellness</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How well did I pray? A little better, if only because I woke up with nightmares.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I spend my time well? With family! That’s the only thing I can hope for.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? OOp.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I exercise? Crud.</p></li>

<h1 id="draft-2-december-22-abandoned-part-of-the-way-through">Draft 2: December 22 (abandoned part of the way through)</h1>
<p>Holidays are a time of memories. For many households in modern America, holidays are the one time a year that the entire intergenerational family is under one roof. Flavors and specific preparations can be handed down from the people with the greatest attachment to them. As the oldest members of the family die and younger family members are born, recipes and meal plans change. Sometimes, things continue to be done the same way, simply because there is no need to question the way things are always done.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, someone new<a href="#fn025" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> will ask what the point is of some tradition. I’m reminded of one from my own family, where we used to trim the ends off of each roast before cooking. When we finally reconstructed the narrative, it turned out that the only roasting pan one of the family owned was too small for the roasts. Even as we got larger pans, however, we continued trimming the roast.</p>
<p>In my own household, we have very little of this generational memory. In part, it comes from the fact that many members of my family in recent generations have disowned or been disowned by their relatives.<a href="#fn026" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h1 id="draft-1-december-22">Draft 1: December 22</h1>
<p>Today I made one of<a href="#fn027" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> the family recipes I’ve inherited. We’ve always called it halishki<a href="#fn028" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>: a dish of dropped egg noodles in a chicken and cream sauce. When you google the word, I mostly find a Polish word for a dish with noodles and cabbage in a pork based sauce. There’s more or less nothing in common with my family recipe and that.</p>
<p>However, this presupposes that my family recipe is Polish. We really don’t know where most of my family came from, especially this part of the family. I’ve always been told it was somewhere Slavic, but that really does not narrow it down too much. If we start searching for Polish drop noodles, we find kluski. Wikipedia for kluski takes us to a similar dish in other portions of Eastern Europe, halusky<a href="#fn029" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>. Halusky is small dropped egg noodles, which does accurately describe the dish that I make, for all that it is also described as typically being served with cabbage.</p>
<p>However, I know that many members of my family have been unable to eat cabbage. That could explain the lack of cabbage in the family recipe. At this point, though, I was excited to learn more.</p>
<p>I got the last name<a href="#fn0210" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> of the person we initially got the recipe from.<a href="#fn0211" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> The last name does come from the areas listed in the second Wikipedia article, which is pretty cool. One of the two variant spellings is allegedly Jewish in origin, which is interesting. I’m sure that there’s a fascinating history there that is now lost to the mists of time.</p>
<p>So, what is the family recipe? As far as I can tell, the recipe is more or less just chicken and dumplings in a cream sauce. I don’t see many recipes for chicken and dumplings that call for cream sauce.</p>
<p>How do I make it, though? I think that every time that I have been personally a part of making it<a href="#fn0212" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>, I’ve followed a slightly different recipe. However, this time through I think will be my recipe going forwards.</p>
<p>I started by melting some butter in a large stock pot and then browning some chicken.<a href="#fn0213" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> The goal was really just getting a bit of color on the meat and a touch of fond on the pan. Once the chicken was browned, we put some butter in the pot and then some white onion. Once the onion looked soft, I added in the chicken stock and let it come to a boil.</p>
<p>We made a very simple dumpling dough<a href="#fn0214" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> out of egg, flour, salt, and pepper.<a href="#fn0215" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> We then spoon some portions of the dough<a href="#fn0216" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> into the boiling stock, chop some celery and add it in, and add the chicken<a href="#fn0217" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> back. From there, I let it simmer covered fora bout an hour, and then uncovered it to let the stock reduce a fair amount. Just before serving, we taste the broth for seasoning, and then add cream to taste and texture.</p>
<p>This time around, we made a huge recipe of it, which should be really nice for leftovers. Historically, it’s tasted far better the next day, as all of the flavors have had time to meld together.</p>
<p>Post Script:</p>
<p>As I look at the past six hundred words, I realize that I want to focus more on the family recipe aspect than the specific recipe we followed. Let’s see how that goes, moving from the specific case to more of a general one?<a href="#fn0218" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<h1 id="flash-fiction-friday"><a href="flash-fiction-232.html">Flash Fiction Friday</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 December 22</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Another Friday, which means it’s time to try to answer another prompt. The prompt this week is among any option. I had no idea how to respond to this prompt, and reading the description didn’t make the prompt any more sensible. However, it did give me some ideas.</p>
<p>The prompt implies a choice. If we keep that in mind, then the prompt shifts to choosing between any option. What could be a good response for that prompt?</p>
<p>My mind is falling immediately to love, but I have to wonder how much of that is just me choosing a new creative rut. I think that the last few times that I’ve written a FFF, it’s been about romance of some sort. What else could we set as a number of choices?</p>
<p>I mean basically anything can be a set of choices, which makes this prompt feel almost too broad. I guess that more or less any writing I produce will be good for the prompt. A part of me really doesn’t like that, though, because part of my ideal for prompts is that it constrains my writing.</p>
<p>So, where else does my mind immediately go?</p>
<p>Given that we did a family recipe for dinner<a href="#fn031" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, I’m finding that I’m thinking about choosing foods. As the new Percy Jackson television series<a href="#fn032" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> is coming out, there’s choices about media we consume, hero’s choices, and the like. Since we play board games as a family, the idea of what game to play comes up a lot.</p>
<p>The hero’s choices feel like something that I want to interact with. What do heroes do? Or, rather, what terrible choice could a hero be forced into?<a href="#fn033" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>I’m still circling around the idea of romance, which may be something that I could do?</p>
<p>So, we have a hero<a href="#fn034" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> who needs to make a choice. Maybe there’s something to say about like deciding between the person you love and the work you need to do? Alright, how can we frame it in a way that hasn’t been done to death a million times?</p>
<p>Or, just as much in the choice, how do we do what we want to do with our full self, ignoring all the self doubt and negative self talk?</p>
<p>A hero has a choice. How explicit do I need to make that? I think that at this point I really need to focus on the writing, which means I need to stop writing about writing and start actually writing.<a href="#fn035" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Actually, wait, let’s think about the normal questions we have. Do I want to have first or third person? I don’t really know. I think that we should write it and see what happens.</p>
<p>Ok so about five hundred words of writing later, I find that I got too far from the prompt. I more or less wrote a retrospective, ten years later. I think that I focused too much on the retrospective, rather than the actual set of choices. Maybe I could do something looking forwards instead?</p>
<p>Ooh, I actually really like the FFF I wrote. Let’s see if there’s anything I can do to spice it up for take three, but if not, I am actually going to be ok with it. I assume that I’ll see something that I want to change, but you never know until you try.</p>
<p>Ooh, wow, the revision is way stronger, I think. I more or less replaced every word, which is kind of funny when you think about it. The scene played out more or less the same, though, which is interesting. I do still feel like I rushed the ending, which is more and more something I realize I struggle with. The ending of a story always seems to come too quickly, and I don’t quite know how to wrap it<a href="#fn036" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> up satisfyingly.</p>
<p>All this to say, good night.</p>

<li><p>Did I embroider today? I need to find the embroidery, and more importantly, I need to find time for the embroidery. Picking a project would probably help too. There has to be someone I can give a small thing to, and I can just make something for one of them.</p></li>

<p>First Published: 2023 December 21</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>I’ve talked a fair amount in these musings about the new site I’m using for writing. As I’ve mentioned on more than a few occasions, I often have trouble motivating myself to write.<a href="#fn041" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> You may have also noticed recently that I’ve more or less been able to put out a post basically every day. There’s a few reasons for that.</p>
<p>I’ve been writing every morning with a friend, for one. I found an internal reason to write daily, for another. Both of those, however, are why I am able to write a blog post every day, not how. Today, I’d really like to spend some time discussing how I’ve been able to write so much more.</p>
<p>Since apparently mid august, I’ve been using a website called 4thewords.<a href="#fn042" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> I guess that knowing I’ve been using it since August doesn’t exactly lend credence to the idea that it helps me write. However, it is working now.</p>
<p>So, what is 4thewords, and how does it motivate me to write more?</p>
<p>4thewords is a few things bundled into one. It is a fairly lightweight word processor<a href="#fn043" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. There’s a fairly active and incredibly positive forum. And, its real selling point, 4thewords is also an RPG.<a href="#fn044" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>That is, you play as a character exploring through the world, completing quests and getting rewards. Like many RPG<a href="#fn045" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>, 4thewords also lets you decorate your character, both with stat boosting and completely cosmetic items. In what I think is a really brilliant choice, they have completely separated the two. That is, you can choose to equip the best equipment for statistics without compromising on your artistic vision.</p>
<p>At this point, you might be wondering how they manage to combine a word processor with an RPG. Most quests are completed by fighting monsters. Monsters are fought by writing words against a time limit. Unlike in a lot of RPG, there is generally no way for the monsters to strike back.</p>
<p>Most of the monsters require a certain number of words written within a given number of minutes. They tend not to require a pace faster than ten words per minute, which is nice when doing something slower than free writing. Even when I’m at my most type a few words and delete, I still average more than ten words typed a minute. There are a few monsters which are called endurance monsters. Rather than requiring a certain number of words, it requires a constant clip. I generally dislike them, because I’m more motivated by “here’s the number of words you have left” than “this is the amount of time you have left.”</p>
<p>However, fighting does not an RPG make. Another important aspect of an RPG is items. Most RPG have both decorative and functional items. 4thewords is no different.</p>
<p>Unlike more RPG, however, the form and function are completely separated. You can choose to equip whatever items give you the stats you want along with whatever items give you the appearance you want. Both sets of items are purchased in the in game stores for mostly in game available items, which you can get by fighting monsters and finishing quests.</p>
<p>Functional items feel a little strange in a game like this. It seems odd that a game where the only combat is writing words within a timeline would have items that affect the gameplay. And, thankfully, there are only three stats: attack, defense, and luck.</p>
<p>Attack follows a formula, where the higher your attack, the fewer words it takes to take down a monster. It doesn’t change the stated numbers, but two words might count for three. Defense increases the amount of time that you have to fight a monster. Unlike attack, it does change the number of seconds that you have to write. A second still lasts exactly<a href="#fn046" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Finally, there is luck, which nominally affects the drops that a monster gives. There’s some variance to what monsters can drop, though there is usually a floor and a ceiling, and the two numbers are not always different.</p>
<p>So, why do I feel like this app helps me write?</p>
<p>I think that there are a few reasons.</p>
<p>First and foremost, I like the fact that there are a series of small goals that I can set to automatically start. Writing 500 words is often a reasonable amount for me at once. Especially if I’m writing quickly, I can generally get through one in about ten minutes. Small monsters, with around 100 words to complete, give an almost constant source of dopamine.</p>
<p>After writing two paragraphs, I tend to take a break for a second or so, because my mind needs a little bit of time to process what I said. Four paragraphs is almost always at least 100 words, which means that after I write them, I get another monster.</p>
<p>The time also helps. Without deadlines, I find that I procrastinate almost indefinitely. Every so often, I’ll look and see that there’s only two minutes left to write 100 words, or twenty minutes left to write 1000. When that happens, I put my nose to the metphorical grindstone and start working as hard as I can to get the words out.</p>
<p>Those two facts do a lot to help motivate me to write. However, there are also a lot of small little features on the site that make it more friendly for me. The overall design is fairly unobtrusive, which means that I’m not horribly distracted while I write. However, the overall design is also very bright, which makes it fun, and I get pretty pictures to cheer me up.</p>
<p>Also, the site is explicit that their goal is helping users to meet their own writing goals. Unlike some sites, which track incredibly hard to make sure that no one is doing anything that could even begin to think of cheating. Even though there are some community aspects to the game, it’s almost exclusively single player. Because of that, the developers are very clear that you should use the site however works best for you.</p>
<p>For some people, that means copy pasting a few hundred words of lorem ipsum after they’ve done some editing or chores. Personally, I tend not to copy paste, though I’ve started thinking of situations where I feel better about it.<a href="#fn047" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> There are also almost no negative consequences in the game. Losing a monster doesn’t affect you in any way except for a single tally somewhere fairly hidden in the game.<a href="#fn048" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> I find that negative consequences can make me want to avoid a situation, and so the absence makes it nice.</p>
<p>And, finally, the game is in active development! I don’t mean that in the way of “the site is full of bugs and major gameplay changes happen daily”, but in the “the developers clearly care about they’re doing, and they add lots of new and exciting seasonal events.” Right now, we’re in the middle of the winter wonderland, which has a few time limited monsters and some special snow themed quests. Just before that, however, was a really exciting quest series for NaNoWriMo!</p>
<p>Anyways, if this inspires you to try the application<a href="#fn049" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> at all, please reach out.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I embroider today? Shoot! Tomorrow for sure.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I play guitar today? Shoot! Tomorrow or tonight for sure.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I practice touch typing today? I made it past c for a second, and then got back to it. I think that right now my struggle letters are r, which I want to type with my ring finger, y, which I want to type with my left hand, and c, which I want to type with my index finger. Since I haven’t gotten all of the letters unlocked, it’s more than likely that other letters (like p) will be an issue.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Reading</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have I made progress on my Currently Reading Shelf? I finished the second book with a friend and started the third. However, I did read both of the books that I wanted to finish this month, I think.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I read the book on craft? I have it, and may remember to do tonight, will keep posted.</p></li>
<li><p>Have I read the library books? Still shoot. I have them with me, though, so may read tomorrow.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write a sonnet? I did not write one two days ago, and yesterday’s was mediocre. Hopefully I remember to write today’s before I’m too tired for it.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I revise a sonnet? Somehow when I’m tired I write sonnets thoughtlessly. That’s probably because I don’t care if the rhyme feels forced or if the story makes no sense.</p></li>

<li><p>Did I write ahead on Jeb? I’m about one third through tomorrow’s chapter, so will try to do more in the next few hours.</p></li>
<li><p>Letter to friends? I played real life pathfinder with some friends<a href="#fn0410" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>, and I got coffee with a dear friend!</p></li>

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>I know that I’ve talked a fair amount in my daily reflections about the site that I’ve started using. Since I don’t know if I’ve explicitly named the site, I use 4thewords, which is a site that tries to gamify writing. The central concept of the game is that you choose to fight monsters, which come with a set number of words and time to defeat them. By and large, this is not terribly difficult. Most of the monsters require around 10 words per minute in order to defeat them.</p>
<p>Of course, like all good RPG<a href="#fn0411" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>, there are stat boosting items. In the case of 4thewords, there are three stats: attack, defense, and luck. I’ve listed them in that order in large part because that’s the order that they’re relevant to me. Attack means that each word you write has a greater effect on the monster you’re fighting<a href="#fn0412" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>. The site gives vague approximations, but the fan site gives the explicit formula.</p>
<p>The words it takes to kill a monster are its default words times one hundred divided by one hundred plus your attack. So, one hundred attack means that it takes half the words to defeat a monster that it claims it should. The part of me that remembers math tells me that n divided by n plus x shrinks very slowly. I think they call it exponential decay. That makes sense, because in order to halve the words again, you would need three hundred attack, and then seven hundred, and so on.</p>
<p>Defense, unsurprisingly, does a similar thing. Defense increases the amount of time that you have to fight the monster. Although it will still say the same amount of time when its waiting in the queue,<a href="#fn0413" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> when the monster fight starts, the timer will show a greater amount of time. I prefer that to seconds not ticking down at the same rate, if only because I like to be able to use the timer as an egg timer of sorts.<a href="#fn0414" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> There’s a similar equation somewhere, though I have not looked it up.<a href="#fn0415" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Finally, we have luck. As this is an RPG, monsters drop loot when they die. Luck affects the amount of loot that is dropped, though last time I checked, it was less clear exactly what the mechanism is for that. Unlike with attack and defense, there is an optimal value for luck.<a href="#fn0416" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Now, I’ve been saying monster in the generic term. There are a lot of unique, hand drawn monsters.<a href="#fn0417" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> One question that you might have is which monster to kill.</p>
<p>I’m actually realizing that I’m falling way too far into the weeds. Let’s restart, this time focusing more on the fact that I want this to be a review.</p>

<h1 id="on-why-versus-how"><a href="why-versus-how.html">On Why Versus How</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 December 20</p>
<h1 id="draft-5">Draft 5</h1>
<p>Why and how feel like such close questions. And yet, there is an unseen gulf of meaning between the two. Far too often, we stop the mind from looking upward by focusing it downward.</p>
<p>Why asks the reason, the cause, the philosophical reason that something is. How, by contrast, asks the mechanism, the physical description of what is. That is, why is to metaphysics what how is to physics.<a href="#fn051" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Children are always gazing upward, considering the nature of the world.<a href="#fn052" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Children ask why the world is the way it is, not how it is. When we tell them that the world is the way it is because of history, that reduces all of creation to a series of forced events. We lose agency in this world.</p>
<p>Why is the sky blue? Rayleigh scattering is true, but it is how the sky is blue. Rayleigh scattering explains that some light is diffracted differently.<a href="#fn053" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> If physics is all that makes the sky blue, then there must not be anything more than physics, is what our minds are lead to believe. By answering questions of why with how language, we fall into the trap of scientism.</p>
<p>More than that, though, we fall into an issue endemic to computer science. Computer scientists are famous for creating solutions to problems without considering the secondary effects, or the reasons the problems may exist. The most famous example that I can think of is a Stanford student who found that when you challenge a parking ticket, most jurisdictions will just drop the charge, because it isn’t worth the hassle to fight it. So, the student wrote an app to automatically contest all parking tickets.</p>
<p>Deep down, the question being asked was how do parking tickets work, not why do they exist. I think that we can all agree it is generally better to not park in disabled spaces<a href="#fn054" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> or in front of fire hydrants. This why and how can also lead to an intellectual stagnation.</p>
<p>Let’s take the example of the research that my group does. We look for the origins of life in star forming regions. From now on, each statement will have an implicit how question attached to it.</p>
<p>We use telescopes such as ALMA and NOEMA to measure the radio frequencies emitted from star forming regions and tie them to specific molecular transitions.</p>
<p>We have catalogs of molecular line information, which we can assign to the spectra coming from space.</p>
<p>We can purchase molecules and collect their rotational spectra.</p>
<p>We can shine known wavelengths of light on known molecules and detect whether or not the molecule absorbs at that wavelength.</p>
<p>We can see a change in voltage, which is directly correlated to the change in light.</p>
<p>Notice how even here, we’ve fallen almost completely away from the actual research goal of searching for the origins of life in star forming regions. All of the how questions are absolutely essential, because without answers, we would not be able to measure transitions or assign them. However, imagine if instead we start asking why.</p>
<p>I’m going to work backwards.</p>
<p>We can see a change in voltage, which is directly correlated to the change in light. (Why?) The software we use is designed to function with an instrument that has a variable resistor. It measures changes in photons as changes in temperature as changes in resistance. V=IR, so that can make a change in I or V if you hold the other constant. (Why?) It’s a detector very similar to the ones that astronomers use? (Why?) Calibrating based on temperature is easier?<a href="#fn055" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>We can shine known wavelengths of light on known molecules and detect whether or not the molecule absorbs at that wavelength. (Why?) We want to know what frequencies the molecule absorbs light at. (Why?) When we know what frequencies the molecule absorbs light at, we can assign its spectra using a limited number of rotational constants. (Why?) Rotational transitions are low energy, which means that a lot of the cold regions of space still have active populations in multiple rotational states, which allows us to quantify temperature and density. (Why?) Knowing what space is like helps us to model it, and can help us learn where we come from. (Hey look we got to the question of origins)</p>
<p>We can purchase molecules and collect their rotational spectra. I feel like this one follows the same train of thought.</p>
<p>We have catalogs of molecular line information, which we can assign to the spectra coming from space. This one follows the same starting from “rotational transitions are low energy”.</p>
<p>So, one thing that I notice is that how questions lead me deeper into the subject, reducing the scope of the question, while why questions bring me higher. There is absolutely a space for both, and I think that both are needed. The ideal is to have feel firmly anchored on the ground and a head floating in the clouds, after all.<a href="#fn056" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>It is important to look deeper at the question. Physics as a field is built on the concept of reductionism. For all that it has limits, as every other method of discovery does, it is an incredibly powerful tool when applied correctly.</p>
<p>However, the same is true for why. Without motivating the work we do, there is no way to connect it to others. Since all that we do is for the greater glory of G-d, and we are called to bring all creation to Him, we need everything we do to be in connection to the rest of the world, especially the rest of humanity.<a href="#fn057" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<h1 id="draft-4">Draft 4</h1>
<p>I often find myself considering language. There are a lot of reasons for it, as I come to realize more and more with each passing year. One of the more common issues that I find myself considering is the shade of difference between similar words. Two of these words are “why” and “how”.<a href="#fn059" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>So, what is the difference between these two words?</p>
<p>Why is focused on the reason behind an act, and how focuses on the process behind it. This distinction, for all that it took me far too long to find, rather than simply looking it up, is a somewhat subtle one. Often, we treat the words as interchangeable.</p>
<p>For example, think of that most basic scientific question: “why is the sky blue?”</p>
<p>Most often, we answer this with mechanistic answers. The sky is blue, we explain, because of rayleigh scattering<a href="#fn0510" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>, or because air is blue<a href="#fn0511" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>, or any of a number of other answers. That is, we tell children how the sky is blue.</p>
<p>Why is that a problem?</p>
<p>I think that it’s a subtle thing. By answering questions where someone looks for a reason with a mechanism, we start to point to mechanisms as reasons themselves. That is, the world we create when why questions are answered with how lacks transcendence.<a href="#fn0512" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> When we see the world as nothing but a machine, moving thoughtlessly along, we feel as though actions cease to matter. After all, if the why is the how, then free will makes no sense.</p>
<p>We can look and see the issue from the opposite perspective. If we answer a how question with a why answer, we fall down to fundamentalism.</p>
<p>How do we celebrate Hanukkah?<a href="#fn0513" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>We celebrate Hanukkah because Hashem preserved the Jewish people before, and He will continue to do so in the future.</p>
<p>I don’t know if that quite works. It feels almost like a non sequitor, and I realize now that there are ways to frame the question that start from a science question, rather than a religious point.</p>
<p>How does a computer program work? We write computer programs to make life easier. We can, hmm no.</p>
<p>By adding the work at the end of the sentence, you cannot really substitute a why.</p>
<p>How do we use computers?</p>
<p>Computers make life easier because they can do a lot of math really quickly. As it turns out, problems which are easy for people to solve tend to involve concepts, while questions that are easy for computers to solve tend to involve caluclations.</p>
<p>That doesn’t answer the question. I think that this is showing me my own bias. I have a far easier time accepting that a process explains a reason than that a reason explains a process. Then again, I find myself incredibly uncomfortable with fundamentalism as a concept. What do I mean by fundamentalism?</p>
<p>That’s a fantastic question. Fundamentalism is answering how questions with a why. When finding the way that something works, we can always delve deeper.</p>
<p>How does rotational spectroscopy work? Molecules rotate.</p>
<p>How do molecules form? Atoms bond.</p>
<p>How do they bond/how are they formed? You see, we can go on and on.</p>
<p>If we answer “how do molecules form” with “because it is favorable for them to do so”<a href="#fn0514" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>, we shift the question from mechanisms to reasons. Actually, as I think about it, the framing of an answer is often the difference between why and how. Why do molecules bond? It’s energetically favorable. How do they bond? Two atoms draw close enough that they release energy by drawing closer.</p>
<p>I don’t think that’s the point I’m trying to make, though. Let’s try one last time, focusing entirely on the whole “using a how to answer a why kills belief in greater workings and makes the world as though automata.”</p>
<h1 id="draft-3">Draft 3</h1>
<p>One question that children stereotypically ask is “why?”.<a href="#fn0515" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> One question that children ask far less often<a href="#fn0516" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> is how. To be honest, I think that the lack of distinction in children’s questions is the start of every issue that we have in communication.<a href="#fn0517" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>Think about explaining grass as green, either because it reflects green light, or because it has chlorophyll. Each of those answers would satisfy the question of either why or how grass is green. And yet, to me, at least, these two sets of responses feel different. If they don’t to you, this musing is only downhill from here. Be forewarned.</p>
<p>So, what is the difference between why and how?</p>
<p>In basic terms, I generally feel like how is looking within, while why looks without. Or, how asks the mechanism by which something operates. Why assumes that there’s a broader meaning to it.</p>
<p>Is that all, though?</p>
<p>If so, it does lend credence to the idea that why questions are questions of faith, while<a href="#fn0518" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> how questions are questions of science. This definition, of course, relies on science being defined as a mechanistic search for the way that the universe functions, while faith is concerned with understanding the reasons which make the universe.<a href="#fn0519" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Something that I keep needing to remind myself is that there needs to be a takeaway from whatever I write. Given that I don’t know what the point of this musing. I guess we can ask the two questions of this musing?</p>
<p>Why am I writing this musing?</p>
<p>I am writing this musing because I have a vague sense of dis-ease<a href="#fn0520" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> about the difference between the words, their meaning, and their use. The two words need to be different, if only because they are different words.</p>
<p>Why else?</p>
<p>I don’t think that there’s a deeper meaning to this musing, at least yet. So, let’s assume that the why has been covered.</p>
<p>How am I writing this musing?</p>
<p>I’m writing this musing by making different drafts of the musing. I’m writing this musing by trying to think about what I think the differences are. I’m writing this musing by figuring out what I think the words mean in connection to other words.</p>
<p>Any other ways that I’m writing this musing? I honestly think that may be it. That’s how I’m writing it.</p>
<p>So I guess the way that I responded to the questions confirms my thoughts about how they differ. Why does seem to point to meaning, and how seems to point to methods. Great.</p>
<p>Let’s move past that though. That last sentence in the how feels striking to me. Words have meaning almost exclusively in how they relate to other words.</p>
<p>When we answer a why question with a how answer, or a how question with a why answer, we do a disservice to others. Or, instead, let’s take the other view. Most of the people that I know do not care so much about the precise usage of language. Instead of saying that the rest of the world is wrong, let us see if I cannot find a way that I can shift my own views of language.</p>
<p>After all, as Randall Munroe once pointed out, language and communication requires two people. What is different about the language that others use where this does not feel like an issue? Only now, twenty five hundred words later, do I feel like it is a good time to look up and see if there’s anything that others would think</p>
<p>Oh gosh <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/5563/how-come-vs-why">someone</a> pointed out that why and how come have the same usage, though how come is less formal. If we put it into my framework, how come is also a mechanistic explanation? I think? Honestly, I don’t know how I feel about it. Oh good, the rest of the internet generally agrees with me that the difference is between process and reason.</p>
<p>I feel really dissatisfied with this end of musing, however. Why? Because I kind of feel like I’ve gotten nowhere after all these words. How? I have failed to answer the question, which is difference in usage.</p>
<p>I probably have time for one more draft. Let’s do everything in our power to focus exclusively on why I think it’s a problem that we answer process questions with reason answers or vice versa. I’m sure that there’s a reason if I stop to think about it.</p>
<h1 id="draft-2.5-metawriting-to-figure-out-how-i-feel">Draft 2.5: metawriting to figure out how I feel</h1>
<p>Why do I muse?</p>
<p>I have talked about this a number of times. In short, I muse because I find it helpful to my life and growth as a person.</p>
<p>How do I muse?</p>
<p>I don’t think I’ve ever explicitly thought about this. This question can be answered in so many ways, with varying levels of granularity.</p>
<p>I muse by posting my thoughts on the blog. I muse by coming up with an idea, writing about it, revising it<a href="#fn0521" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>, and then posting it. I muse by typing words on a digital page. I muse by having thoughts and expressing them.</p>
<p>Why do I hurt?<a href="#fn0522" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>I made a mistake while working out. I fell down. I don’t stretch enough.</p>
<p>How do I hurt?</p>
<p>My leg aches, or my arm feels like daggers are being driven into it.</p>
<p>Does that help me?</p>
<p>Why is causal? Like why presumes a reason, while how just explains mechanisms?</p>
<p>Why is grass green?</p>
<p>Because it doesn’t absorb green light. That’s mechanistic.</p>
<p>Because it’s filled with chlorophyll, which is green. That’s also still a mechanism.</p>
<p>How is grass green?</p>
<p>Because it doesn’t absorb green light. Because it’s filled with chlorophyll, which is green.</p>
<p>Somehow, despite the fact that both of those answers are the same, it still feels vastly different to me. I don’t actually know if there’s anything more that I can say about that. Let’s try, though.</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>I’ve been thinking recently about the difference between why and how. The two words have to be different<a href="#fn0523" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>, but I’ve been struggling to figure out in what way.<a href="#fn0524" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>How feels like something descriptive. That is, I figure out how to end a sentence, because I already know that I’m going to end a sentence. Why, on the other hand, feels prescriptive. If I am figuring out why to end a sentence, it is because I don’t know what its purpose is.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s the way to figure out the difference between how and why: write a few sentences that could use either word and see the way that the meaning changes.<a href="#fn0525" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>I’m going to restart this musing, and I will try my best to use either word only intentionally.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>While writing my reflection on the readings, I mentioned faith like a child. As I drove to religious ed, I thought about faith like a child, and I thought about faith and science. One half formed memory I have<a href="#fn0526" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> was that the difference between faith and science is which questions they seek to answer. Science seeks to answer how, while religion seeks to answer why.</p>
<p>Of course, I then immediately thought about the question that a young child asks. Children do not<a href="#fn0527" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> ask how. They ask why. When a child asks why the sky is blue, however, we tend to give how answers.</p>
<p>That bothered me, for a reason that I’m going to try to work through here in this musing.</p>
<p>Ok, so the most obvious bother is that if the difference between why and how is science and faith, and the two live in different domains, then it’s wrong to answer a why with a how. Now that I’ve expressed the concern, I can set it aside.<a href="#fn0528" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>I’ll trust that the sentence above describes my concern. At least one of those claims is untrue, so let’s list them.<a href="#fn0529" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Explicit: there is a difference between science and faith</p></li>
<li><p>Explicit: science answers how questions</p></li>
<li><p>Explicit: faith answers why questions</p></li>
<li><p>Explicit: the two have different domains</p></li>
<li><p>Explicit: you should answer how with how and why with why</p></li>
<li><p>Implicit: you should answer the question that people asked, not what you want to answer</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Are there other claims? I don’t really think so.<a href="#fn0530" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> There may be, however, so I’ll be willing to add to the list if I need to.</p>
<p>Alright, let’s try to answer the claims one at a time, and see if we can’t find the one that isn’t ringing in tune.</p>
<p>There is a difference between science and faith. No, that’s absolutely true. For all that I’ve talked about how science and mysticism are intrinsically linked, the method of discovering knowledge is inherently different. Science is different than math is different than faith.</p>
<p>By that, I mean that science gains knowledge<a href="#fn0531" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> by measuring and reproducing measurements. Mathematics generates knowledge by testing hypotheses using logic. Faith generates knowledge by divine revelation.</p>
<p>Oh! A claim in there is that why and how are fundamentally different questions. There we go, that’s the sticking point that I have right now.</p>
<p>So let’s see what the difference is between the two. How describes process, while why ascribes meaning? That feels kind of resonant.</p>
<p>That is, how is a descriptive thing, while why is a prescriptive. Ok, that does also work with the difference between faith and science, so let’s run with that take. Now then, what’s wrong with answering why questions with how or vice versa?</p>
<p>Ok, let’s remove the explicit case of the children’s question. Let’s look at the election.</p>
<p>Why do we have a president?</p>
<p>We have a president because we set up a system wherein we elect someone to run the country. That is a why answer to a why question. Oh, yeah, no, that’s definitely the issue.</p>
<p>When a kid asks why the sky is blue, we treat it as though they’re asking how the sky is blue. The sky is blue because air is blue.<a href="#fn0532" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> But, why is the sky blue? That’s a much more difficult question to answer. Honestly, there isn’t an answer that I know of for why the sky is blue, other than the fact that the universe was created in such a way to cause the sky to be blue.</p>
<p>What are other questions that children stereotypically ask?</p>
<p>When a child asks why we have to go to school, on the other hand, we do give them a prescriptive answer. We have to go to school because it’s good to learn, or something.<a href="#fn0533" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>Ok, so I guess my issue is really just with the answer to why the sky is blue. That is, however the only children’s question about science that I can think of.</p>
<p>Oh, wait.</p>
<p>Why is grass green? That sounds like something that a child would ask.</p>
<p>We can answer that descriptively <a href="#fn0534" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a>. Can we answer that prescriptively?</p>
<p>If not, does that show me the issue? Is there a way to frame scientific questions that are why based, rather than how based?</p>
<p>Ooh, that may very well be the issue that I have right now.</p>
<p>Is how is grass green a different question than why is grass green?</p>
<p>On the face of it, yes?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Grass is green because of chlorophyll</p></li>
<li><p>Grass is green because it preferentially reflects or emits green light<a href="#fn0535" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Yeah that’s about it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Why?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Because that’s the best wavelength to absorb light for energy<a href="#fn0536" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Because it was made to be green.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>I guess those are shades of different meaning, for all that I cannot really point to anything specific about it. However, what is the difference between a child’s response to each of those?</p>
<p>If we assume that a child is an automaton, the child will ask why in response to everything else.</p>
<p>So: Grass is green because of chlorophyll. Why?</p>
<p>Because grass gets its color from chlorophyll. Why?</p>
<p>Because there’s a lot of chlorophyll in grass. Why?</p>
<p>Ok I can’t find a good way to continue from there.</p>
<p>Grass is green because it emits green light. Why?</p>
<p>Because chlorophyll emits green light, and that’s what looks green. Why?</p>
<p>Because that’s the best wavelength to gain energy. Why?</p>
<p>Because the sun emits light across a whole wavelength, maximizing at the green. Why?</p>
<p>Because something something quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Ok that’s also not great. That also does cover the actual why answer, which is slowly leading me to the actual issue I have. Despite the fact that I have different senses of the meaning, my impulse is to answer the why questions more or less interchangeably.</p>
<p>What can I do with this?</p>
<p>I think I might have fallen too far into the weeds. Let’s pull back and re evaluate.</p>

<h1 id="on-being-seen"><a href="being-seen.html">On Being Seen</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 December 19</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>I find that it’s always interesting to learn how others see me. I’d like to think that my own self image of myself hasn’t changed over the years, for all that I know that it has. Without delving too deeply into those, it’s been a long and fun journey to really feel like myself in my own skin, which is something I’m glad for.</p>
<p>But, this musing isn’t about how I see myself. It’s about how others see me. I recently realized, after a few conversations, that the way I am perceived is far different than it once was.</p>
<p>Through high school, I think that I was seen mostly as a member of my family. That’s fair, and that hasn’t really changed.<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> However, that was mostly among people who were, if not friends, then at least one link from a friend or family member. When people saw me not as a member of my family, I know that one of the most common thoughts was that I looked like a football player.<a href="#fn062" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Even through college, those were both common statements a common statement. More than that, though, I know that I was often viewed as someone who enjoyed violent sports.<a href="#fn063" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> The other day, though, I was at a rugby field with some graduate school friends, I made a comment about how I was considering trying rugby.<a href="#fn064" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> The friends I was with both expressed surprise, which made sense to me, at first.</p>
<p>After all, I have never once expressed interest in rugby before, as far as they knew.<a href="#fn065" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>However, that was not where the confusion lay. My friends both expressed shock that I would be interested in a physical<a href="#fn066" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> sport.<a href="#fn067" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>That made me curious. I realized that many of the people I’ve met since starting graduate school express surprise when I tell them that people used to think of me as physically intimidating. I’m only now<a href="#fn068" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> realizing that this might have been less an expression of how friendly I am, and more a reflection of a change in the way that I’m generally viewed.</p>
<p>The next day, a friend was apparently talking about me to someone who didn’t know me. My friend described me with many of the common descriptors.<a href="#fn069" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Someone who knew both my friend and the new person commented that I have a nice smile.</p>
<p>I did smile when I heard that.</p>
<p>I don’t disagree with the idea that I have a nice smile.<a href="#fn0610" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> However, I know that in high school, I was very uncomfortable with my smile. I would do everything in my power to avoid smiling in photos. It does make it a little awkward to show photos of high school me to friends now, though.</p>
<p>Returning to the point, I’m realizing that the way I am perceived frequently differs from the way that people in my life say that they perceive me. I’m sure that there’s some introspection I can do about that, and may in the future.<a href="#fn0611" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<h1 id="dungeons-and-dragons-again"><a href="dungeons-dragons-8.html">Dungeons and Dragons Again</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 December 18</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As I mentioned in <a href="dungeons-dragons-7">my last musing about dnd</a>, I made a character whose goal is rolling more dice more often. I don’t know if I actually optimized it, especially because a number of friends pointed out that spell slots are functionally infinite, especially in the kinds of combat that I’m likely to see. Next session I get to fifth level, which doubles the number of attacks I can use, potentially doubling the number of dice I roll a turn. That’s pretty nice.</p>
<p>This session, however, was also a great time. We began with a quick little combat, where we saw some demons<a href="#fn071" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and began to fight. I missed on my first attack, which was sad, so used an action surge to swing again.</p>
<p>Once more, I missed.</p>
<p>That set me up to be flanked, which did almost all of my remaining hit points<a href="#fn072" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. However, I managed to kill one monster on my next turn, and got another with an attack of opportunity. At that point, it was more or less cleanup.</p>
<p>After we defeated the monsters, we were led into a room with puzzles. The puzzles were all fun, and done more or less completely out of character. It’s always fun to have to actually think, rather than simply saying “my character thinks”.</p>
<p>When we managed to solve the riddles, we were given the ability to teleport to waypoints, which feels like it could be a fun mechanic. We were offered the choice to return to the city we had come from, or to teleport further west. Our group chose to go to the West.<a href="#fn073" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Once there, we discovered a town of tieflings that were being plagued by spirits. The story, as we dug into it, seemed to be that there was a chief who committed abominations<a href="#fn074" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>, and something something punishment. One of the consequences was that their harvests would rot.<a href="#fn075" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> We are currently split, staking out the properties overnight to see what happens.<a href="#fn076" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<ul>

<h1 id="reflections-on-todays-gospel"><a href="reflections-on-readings-3-advent-b-23.html">Reflections on Today’s Gospel</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 December 17</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>I love this set of readings, because each of them speaks to me in a way that I don’t normally feel from the readings. Intellectually, I know that every word in the Bible is beautiful, and each verse leads me closer to Truth. Emotionally, though, I don’t always connect.</p>
<p>I’d like to start with the Psalm.<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The Psalm today really encapsulates the entirety of the readings. It is the Magnificat, the Canticle of Mary. That is, it is Mary’s response to seeing her cousin Elizabeth while both are carrying their child.</p>
<p>How does this sum up the readings? First, the Magnificat comes when John the Baptist leaps in his mother’s womb. The Gospel today is John’s ministry and preparation for the coming of the Christ.</p>
<p>Second, it is a prayer. The second reading exhorts us to pray unceasingly.</p>
<p>Finally, it is a song of joy and thanks to the Lord. The Magnificat is a message of joy and hope to the downtrodden and despised. The first reading, from the Prophet, also focuses on this.</p>
<p>The second reading is really just filled with a load of fantastic single lines. I could spend pages discussing more or less every phrase in the reading, but I’ll focus on one in particular.</p>
<p>St. Paul exhorts us to test everything, retaining what is good.<a href="#fn082" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> In a conversation with friends yesterday, I was once again reminded that this approach is not the way that everyone is formed in their faith. In a different conversation, someone explained to me that questions can come from a place of judgement or of curiosity. I think that these two conversations point to the same idea: we either seek to find the truth or confirm what we know.</p>
<p>In raising a child, I cannot understand why you would want them to trust unquestioningly. I am reminded of a verse, where we are told that we are to have faith like children. Every child I’ve ever known has wondered endlessly. When they ask why something is true, they then wonder why the response is true. Of course, there is an element of trust there. A child believes what you tell her.</p>
<p>And so, we are reminded that we must have a faith like that. I have hope that the Pharisees in the Gospel were questioning John on those lines. If someone today preached that they had a new way of forgiving sins, I would be incredibly skeptical. How much moreso would it have been for the faithful of the first century.</p>
<p>It is a common statement by Catholics that the Church is either the Truth and Holiness, or the most vile blasphemy possible. We see reminders of that in the Gospel. John is baptizing in the name of the one who is to come, the one who can forgive all sins. It becomes a fulfillment of the Prophets first reading.</p>
<p>Christ’s ministry was one of healing the ill and uplifting the poor. Throughout the history of the Church, it has spread most by the downtrodden. Even today, many of the conversion or reversion stories I hear come from someone who was in a terrible place.</p>
<p>The Prophet reminds us that we are all called to this ministry. The Lord anointed him, sending His Spirit to rest on Isaiah. We receive that same Spirit in baptism, and we are sealed in it during confirmation.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I embroider today? Embroidery remains trapped in the office. However, the person who got the first embroidered piece liked it.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I play guitar today? I think that I’m starting to like the higher harmonics twang of the new strings.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I practice touch typing today? SHoot!</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Reading</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have I made progress on my Currently Reading Shelf? I finished the first audiobook and started the second.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I read the book on craft? I read a little further and then immediately got inspiration, which is common in the book.</p></li>
<li><p>Have I read the library books? Still no.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write a sonnet? I forgot to write one yesterday, I think at least. That’s a shame. Today’s was pretty good, though.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I revise a sonnet? I had some fits and starts, which meant that I revised as I went.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? I find that the second draft is way cleaner than the first, which makes some amount of sense.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write ahead on Jeb? I wrote another quarter chapter, since I didn’t want to do too much writing on a Sunday.</p></li>
<li><p>Letter to friends? I chatted with someone else who writes letters today. While working on my computer, I realized that I want my writing to count for the arbitrary word goals on this app, which might be part of why I struggle to get letters written. Given that the site explicitly encourages using the word counts as rewards for other tasks, though, maybe it’s worthwhile to just tell myself a letter is worth 250 words and then lorem ipsum it?</p></li>
<li><p>Paper? I started writing an introduction to rotational spectroscopy, then realized that I don’t know how to frame it. Some ideas include: imagine how things rotate normally, now imagine a molecule; imagine a molecule, now think about it rotating; there’s light in space, why?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Wellness</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How well did I pray? Not great, but I hope that I can start to do better.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I clean my space? A little.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I spend my time well? Honestly pretty well! I got through a lot of what I wanted to do.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? No.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I exercise? I played basketball with the religious ed kids, which was fun. Turns out basketball is much easier when you have a sense of proprioception.<a href="#fn083" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Water? I actually think that was something I did well on today, for once. I feel like I drank an appropriate amount of water through most of the day.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>This week’s readings, in a shocking turn of events, are not a struggle for me. Do not get me wrong. I do not sit easily with these readings, completely unaffected. My struggle with these readings is simply in how poorly I live them out.</p>
<p>The first reading comes from the Prophet.<a href="#fn084" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> It opens with a really powerful verse,<a href="#fn085" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> where we are told a few important facts.</p>
<p>In brief, the Lord anoints us and sends His Spirit on us. When we are given the Spirit, we are given a mission. In the case of the Prophet, the mission is to lift up the downtrodden, and a few specific examples are given.<a href="#fn086" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Of course, we as baptized are anointed and given the Spirit. We too have a mission. As Christ reminds us, everything that Isaiah said was his mission in this verse is also a mission we share. We are to comfort the grieving, set free the prisoners, and strive for justice and liberty.</p>
<p>The second verse is where it shifts outside of the conventional modern Christian framework, though. We are told that Isaiah was sent to proclaim a year of Jubilee. Jubilee is a concept that has completely disappeared from the modern consciousness, for all that it is<a href="#fn087" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> an absolutely essential component of a healthy society. In a year of Jubilee, all debts are forgiven.</p>
<p>Now, there are some obvious reasons that we do not have this concept anymore. First, we legally treat corporations as though they are people, and that has bled into the way we discuss things. Copyright<a href="#fn088" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> laws are described as letting corporations own the rights to their work, rather than artists. There is no real reason that a corporation should have its debt forgiven, for much the same reason that there is no reason that a corporation or country having debt is inherently a problem.</p>
<p>The reason that debt is a problem to fall into is that we all know that there is a maximum amount of time that we will work. At some point, we will stop producing, and there will be no new income to pay off our debts. Corporations<a href="#fn089" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>, by contrast, can continue to cycle out workers indefinitely, and so there is no inherent timeline wherein they stop producing income.</p>
<p>Other than the fact that we treat corporations as people, though, the only reasons I’ve seen for not instituting Jubilee are based in the goal of raising corporations above people or in the goal of keeping oppressed down. If we forgive debt, the most common narrative goes, then the companies which issued the debt will be in trouble. Or, as comes up so frequently in discussions about student loans, if we forgive debt, then that just encourages people to take out more loans and live above their means.</p>
<p>In part, that is because of the system we have created, where student debt in particular is nearly impossible to discharge. Even if we did not have a Year of Jubilee, and instead just stopped debts from reaching a point that they are impossible to pay off, then we would see a radical shift in the structure of modern economies. Sorry, didn’t mean to go on a rant here, returning to the readings.</p>
<p>The second reading reminded me of a conversation that I had with friends yesterday. We were discussing, among other things, our own relationships to the faiths that our parents had raised us with. One stark difference between us was that I was raised with the belief that, not only was it ok to question what we are taught, it is actively good. It’s always nice when the Bible supports the take that you have.</p>
<p>St. Paul writes that we should test everything, retaining what is good.<a href="#fn0810" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> I do believe that statement would do wonders in helping the world as we know it. However, it is a difficult statement to practice.</p>
<p>How do we know what is good? Even outside of the concept of forming a conscience, there is the issue of large scale differences. What is good for an individual may be bad for society, or the reverse.<a href="#fn0811" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> How should we balance the conflicting needs of a group to have its members in good condition and each member to live to his or her fullest? I’m not really sure, and that’s just an immediate issue that comes to mind with the question.</p>
<p>However, the existence of edge cases does not preclude heuristics.<a href="#fn0812" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> That is,<a href="#fn0813" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> the fact that there are times that a general principle does not apply does not mean that it doesn’t work in general. If I say, for instance, that children are short, “all” is absolutely implicit in that statement. Even if we find a child who is tall<a href="#fn0814" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>, that does not mean that most children do not remain short.</p>
<p>And so, there are obviously cases where we can look at things and see that they are harmful. Modern psychology agrees that believing that you are unable to improve yourself harms you. Going into the spiritual, believing that to question your faith is to not believe it will lead you either to an unfulfilled life, where you cannot say what you truly believe, or a life where you lose your faith as you question it. Any other examples I can think of are too emotionally charged, and so I’ll leave them as an exercise to the reader.</p>
<p>Where were we?</p>
<p>Right, the second reading reminds us that we are to confront the beliefs that we have, making sure that they lead ourselves and the world to the Lord, our G-d.</p>
<p>I normally skip the Psalm, but I love the Canticle<a href="#fn0815" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> of Mary, which were the verses.<a href="#fn0816" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>And finally, we make our way to the Gospel. I think that this was the first year that I realized that John was doing his preaching while Jesus lived his own private life. As much as I know and truly believe that Christ was born around 30 years before he died, the lack of anything between his childhood and public ministry sometimes makes me forget that they must have happened. While John was preaching his message of repentance, Christ was working in his earthly father’s shop.<a href="#fn0817" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>There’s absolutely something worth meditating on there. First, there’s the statement that Christ makes, which is that whatever we do to the least of people, that we have done to him. I can imagine someone going to baptism in the Jordan, and then seeing Christ in his home. Somehow, they cannot see that the Lord is incarnate in front of them.</p>
<p>More than that, though, it is a reminder that everything has its season. If Christ had begun his public ministry in the Temple when his parents found him as a child, we would not have had the St. John the Baptist. That would have meant that a number of prophecies went unfulfilled.</p>
<p>And, of course, it is here that we see the Pharisees doing as St. Paul commands. They hear that a man is baptizing and preaching repentance. Unsure what that means, they go to question him. John replies honestly.</p>
<p>He is not Elijah, nor the Prophet, nor the Christ. He is simply the voice in the desert<a href="#fn0818" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> telling us to prepare the way.</p>
<p>Ok, this musing got a little out of hand, I think that I should revise it. First, though, there’s bound to be a way to tie the first reading to the Gospel. I can’t think of one, though, so I guess I’ll just have to hope that inspiration strikes while I write the next draft.</p>

<h1 id="on-ratings"><a href="ratings.html">On Ratings</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 December 16</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>What’s the point of rating anything? Ok, that’s a little broad, let’s try that again.<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>A friend asked me to think about five star ratings for books, especially on the pseudo public platforms which aggregate ratings. As I thought about that question, I came to a number of potential responses.</p>
<p>First, I think that five is too many options. Really, I think that you only need two, maybe three if you want to be mean. The two would be enjoyed or did not enjoy, and the third could be for did not finish if you wanted to separate books you read all the way through. I would be very happy with just the two ratings, though.</p>
<p>So, what do I do when I’m given five stars? There’s an impulse to only use one and five star ratings<a href="#fn092" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> However, that feels lacking. If I’m painting in black and white, I shouldn’t just ignore the shades of grey<a href="#fn093" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> just because they’re new and scary.</p>
<p>So, let’s consider how I could use five stars. One star could be the third bin that I had before, books that I could not finish because they were so poorly written. Thankfully, very few books that I’ve encountered fall into this category, if only because most people who put books out in a public enough form that I find them have a competent grasp on the English language.<a href="#fn094" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Five stars would have to be the absolute favorite books ever written. The kind of books that you can’t stop talking about when you read them, to the point that your friends feel obligated to either end the friendship or read the book themselves.</p>
<p>Even though I like shades of grey, I’ve always admired paintings that work in shades of black.<a href="#fn095" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> And so, I can find a use for two stars: books that I didn’t finish because I didn’t enjoy them. These would be books that I’m certain others would enjoy, I just wasn’t one of them when I encountered it.<a href="#fn096" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Four stars would be books that I really liked, but that I haven’t made into a facet of my personality. And, of course, that leaves three stars to hold the rest of the books, the majority of what I read.<a href="#fn097" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>But, this is a single dimensional view of the process. For all that<a href="#fn098" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> I do think that most books I read fit that scale, it does have some gray areas. Between a book with an astounding concept and fair<a href="#fn099" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> execution and a book that brings nothing new to the genre but does what it sets out to perfectly, which deserves a higher score? As I once dove,<a href="#fn0910" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> I then find a use for the fractional stars.<a href="#fn0911" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>In diving, two criteria determine your score: how well you did the dive and how hard the dive was. The difficulty of the dive modifies how much the points for your dive are worth. Doing that, I could have a few modifiers and apply them to my base score, putting books in the correct bin as needed.</p>
<p>Of course, this single bin approach to diving works because we can generally agree what the optimal dive looks like.<a href="#fn0912" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Books, however, serve a variety of purposes, and what makes a book successful in one domain is often what precludes its success in another. Most modern sites are aware of this fact, and allow for tagging of books so that people can remember that one book is a cozy pastoral fantasy<a href="#fn0913" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> and another is a fast paced exploration of morality.<a href="#fn0914" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Then, of course, the rubric breaks down. I now, on some level, need to have separate rubrics for each tag and combination of tags. This all ignores the fact<a href="#fn0915" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> that modern sites aggregate the data. Here we come to a new issue.</p>
<p>I, like most people, am aware on some level that my time on this earth is finite. I do not have the time to read every book that comes out in a given month, let alone every book that comes out every month. And so, I rely on the aggregation of other readers in deciding what to read, at least on some level.<a href="#fn0916" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> This comes with a conundrum.</p>
<p>When I rate something with four stars, it falls below a book that I rate with five stars. And so, all the different criteria end up collapsing into that same rating system I introduced at the start of the musing: good<a href="#fn0917" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> or bad<a href="#fn0918" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>. I’ve heard it described as five stars means you were ok with it, and everything below five is how much you disliked it, which isn’t that far off from the way that ratings end up playing out.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I embroider today? I sadly didn’t end up going into the office today. Embroidery remains trapped there.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I play guitar today? I did! I’d been noodling on guitar and it reminded me of the opening to a song, so I sang through it.<a href="#fn0919" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> After that, I played some scales.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I practice touch typing today? This day has flown by, and even though I wouldn’t change most of what I did, that doesn’t make the time come back.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Reading</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have I made progress on my Currently Reading Shelf? I listened to a little more of the audio book! Soon it will be finished, which is cool.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I read the book on craft? On my daily goals this morning, I did put it on the list, but didn’t get around to it, sadly enough.</p></li>
<li><p>Have I read the library books? I renewed my books, which is a step in the direction of believing that I’ll read them. Maybe I have to return two books a month minus however many I read starting next month? That would make me sad but might make me read more books. At the very least, I’d decrease my bookshelf by 2 a month.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write a sonnet? Yesterday I actually liked the sonnet I wrote. Today’s was pretty decent</p></li>
<li><p>Did I revise a sonnet? Nope. I think that I’ve learned how to do so, though, which was the monthly goal.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? I actually kind of like the post today.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write ahead on Jeb? I wrote about half a chapter. If I weren’t so tired, I’d do more.</p></li>
<li><p>Letter to friends? I should remove this goal, since I doubt I’ll make progress on it before the year is out.</p></li>
<li><p>Paper? I thought about what I’d want it to say at a large scale picture.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Wellness</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How well did I pray? Oof.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I clean my space? Yes, but I think the net was dirty.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I spend my time well? Kind of! I was somewhat thoughtless through the day, but that’s kind of to be expected.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? Shoot.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I exercise? Um.</p></li>
<li><p>Water? Ope, that’s absolutely something I forgot. Let’s do that now.</p></li>

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Yesterday a friend asked me about my feelings on five star scales. As I thought about it a little more, though, I realized that I have a lot of feelings about rating systems in general. Today seems like as good of a place as any to discuss how I feel about them.</p>
<p>Rating systems, especially as they exist now, suffer from the tragedy of the commons.<a href="#fn0920" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> Most rating systems are not used for individuals, but for public ranking. That’s an issue, for a lot of reasons.</p>
<p>Let’s explore why.<a href="#fn0921" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>If I have five stars to rate every book I read, for instance, there are a few ways that I could do it. Assuming that 0 stars is not an option, of course, I only have five categories to place absolutely everything I read. There are few easy books to place.</p>
<p>First, there are the books that I read over and over, finding something different in them each time. The sort of books that we love because they feel able to grow with us just as much as we grow. They, obviously, would get five stars.</p>
<p>On the opposite end of the spectrum, there are a lot of things that I’ve read that I could not get more than a few pages into<a href="#fn0922" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> because there was absolutely no sense of grammar, tense, or spelling. An argument could be made that ratings should be reserved for books I’ve finished, and not for everything I’ve tried to read. Of course, if I have a rating system, I want it to be a record that I can use in the future. Since that’s true, I want to show everything that I’ve attempted to read.</p>
<p>So, that’s one star and five stars taken care of. What about books that I couldn’t get through, just because I didn’t enjoy them? It feels very unfair to put them at the same place as books that I couldn’t read because they were illegible<a href="#fn0923" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>, which implies that I should put it at two stars.</p>
<p>Looking at the other direction, there are a lot of books that I enjoyed, but would not plan to reread because I don’t think that there’s anything more that I want to gather from the book.<a href="#fn0924" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> Or, there are books that I plan to reread, not because I find that they are thought provoking or help me grow, but because they’re comfortable. Similar to a nice bowl of Kraft brand mac and cheese, sometimes you aren’t looking for the best, simply the most familiar.</p>
<p>And that leaves one star for everything else I read. Three stars would mean that I finished the book, and either didn’t enjoy it, or don’t plan to reread. Honestly, most books that I read should fall here, if we think that stars should be averaged. Then again, if I consider that I know what I like to read, it would make sense that the books I read would generally be above the baseline.</p>
<p>Of course, this creates an immediate tension. Five stars works best if there’s even distribution between categories. For instance, if I put all books that I did not finish as one star, I then have four stars to granulate my feelings, rather than simply three. Others might immediately point out that fractional stars exist.</p>
<p>Honestly, I find that fractional stars start to become worse than useless for me very quickly. Once I get above general feelings of no, sure, yes, and absolutely<a href="#fn0925" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>, I don’t think it’s fair to grade books on a single axis. How do I compare a book that has fantastic ideas but less than stellar execution with a book that is not as thought provoking but does what it attempts perfectly? As a diver, there’s the voice in my head that says you add modifiers.</p>
<p>For those who don’t know, points in diving come from two, arguably separable places. First, there’s the score that the judges give. The sum of the three middle judges’ scores<a href="#fn0926" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> is the first point in scoring. In that regard, it is optimal to make sure that any dive you do is done to the absolute highest score possible.</p>
<p>However, there is a secondary consideration. Each dive is assigned a degree of difficulty. That value is multiplied by the first score to produce the final score for a dive. In that regard, it is optimal to attempt the most difficult dive possible, because it has the highest modifier.</p>
<p>Of course, since diving is a sport judged by humans, there are elements of bias. Dives that land on hands, for instance, tend to be scored more favorably than dives which end on feet. More than that, though, a lot of judges are more forgiving of small errors in more difficult dive, whether because it’s difficult to see every part of a more complex dive or because it just seems more impressive.</p>
<p>Before each meet, a diver therefore needs to consider how best to balance doing a dive well and doing a difficult dive. Returning to the book, it could make sense to make modifiers. Of course, since we’re still<a href="#fn0927" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> only on the single person use case for ratings. I don’t need to have hard numbers, especially if I read books fairly often. Having vague ideas of the modifiers I want to apply is probably good enough.</p>
<p>Now, the astute might notice that diving does collapse those two scores into one at the end. I could, in theory, do the same. However, I do not always want to read the same thing. I tend to have around ten books in my currently reading shelf. If we look at them, I can categorize them as<a href="#fn0928" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Two dense and difficult creative nonfiction books about topics I want to learn more about</p></li>
<li><p>Two dense theology books</p></li>
<li><p>Two literature books<a href="#fn0929" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Two somewhat hard books that I want to learn from.</p></li>
<li><p>Four beach reads,<a href="#fn0930" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> some of which are fiction, and some of which are nonfiction</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It isn’t fair to compare a beach read to a literature book, especially because the very things that make one good in its own genre are<a href="#fn0931" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> what would make it bad in the other genre or what disqualifies it. Now, of course, nearly every book sorting site has ways of adding categories to the books you read. If I then just rank each book with its modifiers and tags, I can sort the tagged books when I want to recommend or reread something. And, to some extent, that could work.</p>
<p>However, there are more than two factors that I want to consider. As much as it kind of feels wrong to say<a href="#fn0932" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a>, the politics that the author espouses in a book are relevant to how much I enjoy them. A book that has an interesting premise, is well written, but concludes with statements like how slavery is fundamentally a good thing, is not something that I want to recommend, if only because I don’t want anyone in my life to think that I think slavery is fundamentally good.<a href="#fn0933" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>So, we get to the point that reducing everything to a single number becomes somewhat meaningless. However, as I alluded to earlier, the danger with ratings is that they do not exist in a void. When I rate something, the ratings generally become somewhat public. Now, there’s a new level of consideration that I have to use.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I want to give accurate and useful ratings for my own purposes. On the other, I also want the authors I like to succeed. I know that a lot of people actively sort to find the highest ranked books within a genre. Truth be told, I cannot say that I am too different.</p>
<p>Of course, this does lead to a bit of a chicken and egg issue. The fact that only high rated books get read means that people are more likely to give anything they like five stars, which means that the quality of anything with less than five stars starts to drop dramatically. On one site I read often, grammar that is nearly impossible to understand is still given a three star by some commenters.<a href="#fn0934" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> As this cycle continues, each feeds more and more into the other, making it so that the rating system would really be best served by a simple positive or negative. I remember seeing that Netflix had switched to that, and I think they found it was more effective for what they wanted.</p>
<p>So, right now I’ve only discussed books and rating them on a five point scale.<a href="#fn0935" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> I think that most of the lessons that I want to hit on are more or less the same. Time to revise this and see if we can’t make the writing sparkle a little more. Might be worth framing the whole thing as “start from yes no, then grow into five stars, then grow into multi dimension that collapses, then go to tags, then back”, because there’s fun in dramatic irony.</p>
<p>Right?</p>

<li id="fn0914" role="doc-endnote"><p>don’t immediately have a book to place to this, but I’m sure that there’s at least a few that I’ve read. Oh, I suppose that the one Discworld book where Vimes gets possessed by the Summoning Dark would be that. Or Mort, or any of the Death Books. Wow look at that<a href="#fn09ref14" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0915" role="doc-endnote"><p>I keep wanting to use of course, which makes sense, because I’ve thought about this a lot and already written a draft today. If my thoughts aren’t obvious to me right now, that’s an issue<a href="#fn09ref15" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0916" role="doc-endnote"><p>honestly, these days most of what I read comes from a single recommendation, so I guess this maybe works for me the abstract reader, not me the physical body. Oh, also a lot of books I just pick up in the library because they look interesting (in their titles, since they’re by and large textbooks or academic texts that aren’t in CS, the covers aren’t pretty), which also doesn’t have aggregation information other than implicitly, since the library chose to stock it<a href="#fn09ref16" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn0920" role="doc-endnote"><p>ok so I fully recognize that the tragedy of the commons is a completely ahistorical idea, given that commons were famously well maintained by everyone. However, it’s a phrase that works well enough right now<a href="#fn09ref20" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0921" role="doc-endnote"><p>not that I think any of my readers couldn’t do this on their own, just that it feels like it could be useful for me to do this for myself<a href="#fn09ref21" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn0923" role="doc-endnote"><p>is that the right word? kind of feels like it shouldn’t since I have a lot of internal ideas about legibility being a handwriting thing. A quick search tells me it’s understandable, so I guess it works. Weird<a href="#fn09ref23" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0924" role="doc-endnote"><p>initially I said either, but I can’t think of another reason that I wouldn’t reread a book. Maybe my imagination is just lacking these days<a href="#fn09ref24" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0925" role="doc-endnote"><p>honestly, the fact that I have a four point scale for life and that these are the four points does say a lot about me<a href="#fn09ref25" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0926" role="doc-endnote"><p>so in 5 judge situations, they drop the high and low score each time. Since judges aren’t themselves being judged, it doesn’t matter whose score gets dropped in cases where multiple judges give the same score (actually, as I think about it, there was a statistic on some of the report sheets I’ve seen from meets with rankings of judges based on how often their scores were taken. I wonder if someone’s ever explored that). In three judge meets, all scores get taken. I think that you’re not supposed to have even numbers of judges, for the obvious reason<a href="#fn09ref26" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
