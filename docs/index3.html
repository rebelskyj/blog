<p>Anything in the future is worth less than having it now. For all that the previous sentence feels like the rantings of a child, they really underpin a lot of modern economic thought.<a href="#fn001" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> In economic terms, most everything either appreciates or depreciates, and most do so in some sort of exponential fashion.</p>
<p>In retirement advice, this is usually used as a way to encourage 20 and 30 somethings to enjoy their lives a little less.<a href="#fn002" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In this post, however, I’m going to use it as the way of encouraging me to become slightly better.</p>
<p>I think that I can improve as a person. Even though I do agree that the exponential growth implied by most basic theories of compounding are unrealistic or unsustainable<a href="#fn003" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, there is still something to be said for compounding generally. Every day that I go forth with a skill is a day that I can improve the lives of those around me through that skill. Since I live in a society with capital requirements, I also have a chance to use any skill for a profit.</p>
<p>It’s far more than that, though.</p>
<p>There’s an old interview my grandmother once had, where she debated someone about whether or not everyone should get a liberal arts degree. As you might expect from everything about me, she argued very much in favor of universal liberal arts education. In her mind, and as a partial consequence, my mind, education is an inherently positive thing.<a href="#fn004" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref4"><sup>4</sup></a> We are changed by everything we experience, and education helps any such change to be positive. When we learn facts, we are able to connect events and realities. When we learn theories and heuristics, we are better able to make sense of the world. And, more than anything, I think that learning is about finding joy in the world.</p>
<p>The Almighty created the heavens and the earth for humanity.<a href="#fn005" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref5"><sup>5</sup></a> We are called to seek the Divine, and are given the wonder of the universe to better understand Divinity. We are given talents and seeds for growth and asked to plant and nurture them in ourselves and others.</p>
<p>Through all of this, there’s something to be said for laying groundwork today for a better tomorrow.</p>
<p>The nearer term the future and the greater the expectation of gains, the more I should be willing to give now. That feels reasonable. If spending two hours on a project makes me feel marginally better for the following hour, I’m not sure if it’s worth it. If spending two hours is supposed to me feel marginally better for an hour in three weeks, I know that it’s not.</p>
<p>There’s also the cost to be considered. Something that takes minimal effort is worth doing, even if the expected gain is low. I know that after stretching I feel better in the moments to follow, the rest of the day, and the following days. I even tend to feel better during it.</p>
<p>The initial premise of this post was self improvement. What can I do to make myself better, and how much is bettering myself worth?</p>
<p>I’m reading a book right now called <em>Radical Acceptance</em>, and one of its key points is that only after accepting the realities of ourselves can we change any of them. The author is pretty clear that the goal is not attempting to change things, but I can take from books what I want. Still, there’s a large difference between accepting reality and settling for reality.</p>
<p>How do I want to improve? Let’s spend a minute and think.</p>
<p>I want to be more productive. I want to be more in shape. I want to be more kind to myself and others. I want to learn how to be vulnerable. I want to write, just so very very many words for my thesis. I want to experience the world around me, highs and lows.</p>
<p>Wow that went all over the place.</p>
<p>Ok so, writing and being productive obviously go hand in hand, since the productivity I’m searching for is generally writing right now.<a href="#fn006" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Being in shape is probably not a great goal as an end in itself, and wanting to be in shape for how I look is also not a good goal, since bodies change and I should never strive for a bodily ideal that absolutely is not sustainable for the rest of my life. I do, however, want to be able to experience the world around me.</p>
<p>When a friend asks if I want to go for a run, I’d like to be able to keep up. I don’t want to be winded when I’m walking somewhere or going up stairs. I want to be able to move my body into different poses. I want to be able to pick stuff up.</p>
<p>When I am more centered and grounded, I am more able to experience the world. When I am more centered and grounded, I am more able to be kind. When I am more centered and grounded, I am more able to accept weakness, and therefore show vulnerability.</p>
<p>So, what can I change to be more productive, in shape, centered, and grounded? Luckily, the answers are all the same: be more mindful and work out more.</p>
<h1 id="draft-2-3-april-2025">Draft 2: 3 April 2025</h1>
<p>A common idea in economics, especially modern economics, is that a dollar tomorrow is worth less than one today. There are plenty of arguments for this<a href="#fn007" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref7"><sup>7</sup></a>, but most boil down to the obvious that it’s always better to have than to not have. When you combine this with general ideas of compounding interest<a href="#fn008" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref8"><sup>8</sup></a>, you get some ideas about saving like “any dollar you spend today is the same as spending two dollars in ten years or four dollars in twenty or etc etc.”<a href="#fn009" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref9"><sup>9</sup></a> I don’t really love that argument, because like a guitar that costs five hundred dollars today, even if it wouldn’t be worth 2000 to me in twenty years if I was to buy it then, could very well emotionally be worth that amount then. Also, as I talked about in the previous draft, I can only ever experience the present.</p>
<p>I’m now realizing that previous sentence is really the issue underlying a lot of my failure to self care. Any time that I spend doing something unpleasurable now with hopes of it paying dividends in the future is fundamentally happening to an alien me. I have no idea what I will be like even tomorrow, at least on an emotional level. However, much as I can think through choices in ways like “doing this will likely harm someone in another country”, or “this will have bad effects in fifty years”, I think that I can trust that I will always want to be supporting the future me. A future me who turns to a life of crime is likely having a harder time than I am now, and deserves all the help I can give.</p>
<p>So, then, what is the right way to do self care knowing that money spent now is money gone forever, anything gained now will either depreciate<a href="#fn0010" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref10"><sup>10</sup></a> or compound<a href="#fn0011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref11"><sup>11</sup></a>, and any action I do is ultimately laying another brick in the road of my life.<a href="#fn0012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>I’m just now rereading the initial prompting, and it was not about self care at all!.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-3-april-2025">Draft 1: 3 April 2025</h1>
<p>In economics, there’s an idea of time discount. In short, it’s the idea that money today is worth more than money tomorrow. For whatever reason, I’ve taken at least a few surveys that ask questions on the nature of “would you rather one hundred dollars at X point in the future or fifty dollars today?” And, in general, I think that I generally have a fairly low time discount, if only because I have a decent understanding of general inflation rates and a pretty low acute need for 50 dollars.</p>
<p>Like most economic theories, this can be immediately applied to absolutely everything, and I’m sure I’m not the first person to treat taking care of myself as a time discount problem. The me of the future will reap a large number of gains for any number of small inconveniences now. Getting a degree, especially an advanced degree, is very often posited in the language of a time discount. “It’s worthwhile to get paid peanuts now,” they say, “because in the future you will make far more!”</p>
<p>Still, my goal here is not to think about how things are worth less to me in the future generally, but to specifically try to reframe the things that I do to take care of myself in this way. At the easiest, let’s take eating.</p>
<p>I know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that I feel better on the day after I ate well than the day after I ate minimally or generally poorly.<a href="#fn0013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref13"><sup>13</sup></a> I have faith in the medical science that tells me that setting up habits now will make the me of the future healthier. I have no difficulties in putting into practice ideas of saving for the future, and yet I do not put the effort to make sure that the future I fund will be enjoyable by the me of then.</p>
<p>I do know that I have more faith in money, being external to me, than my own health, which is dependent on so much. Still, even in the short term, I know that I am happier, better able to handle life’s struggles, look better, and feel more energized for less sleep when I spend more time working out. I even find that I am more productive, I think even when taking into account the hours spent not working or doing other hobby. However, on any given day, I am almost always more productive when I do not work out.</p>
<p>I don’t really know what else I’m actually trying to say here, other that like when I think about actions that I want to do or want to want to do<a href="#fn0014" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref14"><sup>14</sup></a>, I should really stop framing the present me as much.</p>
<p>There is, of course, the counter argument to a lot of saving. After all, the age of your life when you are most able to take life by the horns<a href="#fn0015" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref15"><sup>15</sup></a> is the age when you’re most encouraged to be planning for the future. In some regards, this is obviously a holdover from when society was more Christian, though I’m not sure if it’s initially a Catholic or Calvinist way of doing the world. However, there is also research saying bad events are more meaningful than good. All that this paragraph is to say: I don’t want to let my aspirations for the future prevent me from experiencing the present.</p>
<p>That’s applicable in finance and self care, even if I think that they take up different spheres.</p>
<h1 id="draft-0-2-april-2025">Draft 0: 2 April 2025</h1>
<p>Wow, look at me, writing parts of drafts before the day I post. Anyways</p>
<p>There’s a concept in economics called time discount. I know that on at least a few occasions I’ve been asked a series of questions that starts with something like “would you rather have 100 dollars today or 50 dollars today?”. This has an obvious and correct answer. After choosing 100, I am then prompted between 50 today or 100 tomorrow.</p>
<h1 id="daily-reflection-3-april-2025">Daily Reflection: 3 April 2025)</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Intentionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At least hourly, stand up, drink water, take two deep breaths, and do a stretch of some sort</p>
<p>I think that I did actually do a pretty good job of this yesterday. I at least paid attention to my body and tried to be standing daily.</p></li>
<li><p>Be proactive about avoiding overwhelm and when feeling overwhelmed, stop and figure out why.</p>
<p>It’s wild how quickly asking myself what, exactly I’m feeling and why stops me from feeling bad.</p></li>
<li><p>Light a candle and read by candlelight each night. Along with this, leave all electronics outside of the bedroom and/or move them away at least an hour before bed time.</p>
<p>Didn’t do great on this one, found a video I really wanted to watch right before bed.</p></li>
<li><p>Candle time in the morning before electronics. Use the time for prayer</p>
<p>Didn’t do this. Found a video I wanted to watch this morning.</p></li>
<li><p>Focus on good posture, especially straight back and making sure that neck isn’t awkwardly positioned.</p>
<p>Did shockingly well at this one, for all that wow it really feels like my upper back is seizing up</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t waste time, and in particular, be mindful about making sure to take breaks and rest. Especially make sure to do rest which revitalizes the me of tomorrow, rather than rest which simply keeps me in stasis.</p>
<p>Did generally ok with this, though while teaching<a href="#fn0016" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref16"><sup>16</sup></a> I did definitely find myself twiddling my thumbs, and as mentioned, watched videos this morning instead of the mindfulness. I did, however, stretch for a full half hour last night. It’s wild how much more fun stretching is when you feel flexible.</p></li>
<li><p>Interpersonal Relationships:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Figure out what belongs in a normal letter to a friend.</p>
<p>Read a book from 1860 yesterday about gentlemanly etiquette. It had a section on letters, which did give the advice of only writing letters when I have a reason to. Outside of that, it was very clear that one needs to write in a clean hand and with good spelling and grammar and etc. The clean hand is probably something I can work on. I have a hand which is beautiful and legible and should work on using it more.</p>
<p>In general, the advice was to simply write in a letter what you would say to a person in person, which was pretty helpful.</p></li>
<li><p>Get back into writing letters.</p></li>
<li><p>Work to message friends at desired intervals. I know that I said today was going to be the day that I made the list, but I don’t know if it is.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Professional:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Do the Thesis and other research requirements. Upcoming deadlines:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Brain dump about science communication (Overdue)</p></li>
<li><p>Brain dump a publicly accessible chapter (Overdue)</p></li>
<li><p>Have final convergences for the results I’m trying to reproduce (due 4/4)</p></li>
<li><p>Draft of the first paper (due end of month, but I want to make sure that I’ve reupdated it sooner than later)</p></li>
<li><p>Finish revising and editing the overview of a program chapter (due 4/7) and send it to the boss</p></li>
<li><p>Revise the Science communication and publicly readable chapters (due 4/7)</p></li>
<li><p>Send the science communication chapter to the boss (4/14)</p></li>
<li><p>Brain Dump the background to the program (4/14)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Only do the work I feel called to when I’ve finished the tasks set to me for the day or outside of normal working hours (post 1725)</p>
<p>Turns out that reminding myself that falling into obsession is bad means that I don’t!</p></li>
<li><p>Start making the giant citation document so that I don’t have to search for citations later.</p>
<p>The old<a href="#fn0017" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref17"><sup>17</sup></a> articles are in Zotero now.</p></li>
<li><p>Work towards future career:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Figure out the difference between my public-facing and field-facing presentation affects. As I focus on becoming a better presenter, I need to become aware of the difference and how to switch them.</p></li>
<li><p>Need to look for jobs</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Health:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Spiritual:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Get back into the Lenten goals (pray chaplet of St. Michael, give money equal to amount I’m spending on myself, stop scrolling social media, stop playing video games)</p>
<p>I printed the chaplet out and brought it to my bedside, did not read it though.</p></li>
<li><p>Be intentional about prayer. That means both making time for prayer and actually doing it.</p>
<p>While teaching the children’s Sunday school analogue<a href="#fn0018" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref18"><sup>18</sup></a>, I made them do some silent prayer, and prayed during that.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Physical:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start focusing on posture again, especially while sitting.</p>
<p>Really did that yesterday, and I’m beginning to wonder if I might end up pushing my shoulders too far down and back. I have to imagine I’ll be able to figure out what that’s like, but given how tight my chest is when I try to sit like that, it’s probably a ways off.</p></li>
<li><p>Go to group fitness classes more regularly and more often. If not, do workout at home</p>
<p>Since the First Wednesday of the Month is always a long day for me, only ended up with a half hour<a href="#fn0019" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref19"><sup>19</sup></a> stretch/yoga time</p></li>
<li><p>Feed myself simply and healthily. Healthy here means trying to generally avoid processing.</p>
<p>On Wednesdays I get suspiciously cheap burgers, and I accept that those are almost certainly hyperprocessed. Otherwise did ok! Forgot berries at home which meant I had oatmeal with jam yesterday, which felt wrong somehow.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Mental:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clean Life:</p></li>
<li><p>Remove dirt and clutter from physical spaces (standard definition of clean): I am still actively behind on this, but I have hope that I will claw my way back to a comfortable place.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At least once a week, each room has nothing on the floor</p></li>
<li><p>At least once a week, all surfaces which are not inherently storage are cleared off</p></li>
<li><p>At least once every two weeks, each room is vacuumed</p></li>
<li><p>At least once every month, all non-storage surfaces are explicitly washed/cleaned</p></li>
<li><p>At least once a week, I get rid of at least one item that I notice (meaning throw away or in rare circumstances gift or donate)</p></li>
<li><p>Clean sight lines. Is my space set up in a way that orients me towards my goals for the space? If not, how can I make it so?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Spend time each day thinking about the goals for the day, and getting them out of my head and onto the page.</p>
<p>This has been really helpful for that, as has making sure that, while my tea brews in the morning, I start by thinking about the goals for the day.</p></li>
<li><p>Continue to explicitly confront the voice in my head that says that people hate me.</p>
<p>Haven’t really needed to do!</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reading</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start reading and returning the library books I have.</p></li>
<li><p>Finish the book on mindfulness I started. (also make a list of the exercises in the book and try them out)</p></li>
<li><p>Read more poetry</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Music:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Work on guitar</p></li>
<li><p>Learn the songs that jam partner suggested and/or requested I learn</p></li>
<li><p>Get back into the album.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Write poetry more often, ideally nightly.</p>
<p>Shoot! Forgot this one</p></li>
<li><p>Find a way to add meta data to my blog posts and then add the meta data</p></li>
<li><p>Not only write blogs, but also post them.</p>
<p>Yesterday I even managed to do this without my writing buddy!!<a href="#fn0020" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Get back into writing the web novel</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Other hobbies, do them.</p></li>

<h1 id="on-science-communication"><a href="science-communication.html">On Science Communication</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2025 April 2</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-2-april-2025">Draft 1: 2 April 2025</h1>
<p>I’m wondering if the daily reflection I have might be too long. It’s great and all, but spending twenty minutes every day on them feels like a lot. Then again, it isn’t as though I really need the twenty minutes for anything. Time I choose to spend is time well spent. That’s probably a good thing for me to keep reminding myself.</p>
<p>Onto the actual meat of this post. As I have mentioned here before, my current career plans have me going into science communication in some form or another. One of the leading voices in the field, at least as far as I know, is a Professor Emeritus at my school. I met with him a few weeks ago to get his advice on finding a career in the space. He gave me a lot of good advice, and in particular gave me a few questions that are important for me to answer.</p>
<p>This is a space for me to try to think of some initial answers to the questions.</p>
<p>His first thing to remember, though not a general question, was what the purpose of any given demonstration is. That is, what am I trying to communicate, and is what I have prepared effective for that task?</p>
<p>The two biggest questions were really, “why should I care about science?” and “why should my tax dollars go to funding (insert research that does not seem to improve someone’s life)?”<a href="#fn011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> I’m going to treat them as the same question, at least to start, but will keep in mind that they are not intrinsically the same question.</p>
<p>So, why should a random person care about science?</p>
<p>At a visceral level, I cannot think of an answer to this question. There’s a meme that goes around sometimes that says something along the lines of “if you don’t care about other people, I don’t know how I can convince you to.” It feels similar to my feelings about science. Why should someone care about science feels like as ridiculous a question as why someone should care about others. Still, that’s not a good way to win any hearts or minds, so let’s fight past our own reactions.</p>
<p>My general life view says that we are all born interested. Before we know how to divide the world into science and art and language and sport, we simply absorb what’s around us. I don’t think that I have ever met a child who was not at least nominally interested in anything, when framed correctly.</p>
<p>Life, or to be more precise, the systems that we all live in, beat the joy out of learning and exploration for so many people. When I was in college, a frequent question I would ask my teammates and prospective students looking to join the team what hobbies they had outside of the sport. A number of them had no answer. This used to surprise me, until I learned more about the difference between going to school in rural versus urban America.</p>
<p>In rural America, it is not only acceptable, it is almost expected to be somewhat of a dilettante, at least in my experience. There simply are not enough people in the entire school to be able to segregate groups into a single activity. There were of course general trends and class divides, even if I did not see them at the time. After all, if you need to work every night to put food on the table, you aren’t going to be able to do every extracurricular.</p>
<p>Almost every athlete did multiple sports, especially the top ones. The only exceptions to this that I can think of are some swimmers and soccer players, who joined club teams during the off season. In part, I have to assume that’s because the programs were all no cut. If you showed up and put in work, you were guaranteed a spot in the team, and as far as I can tell, everyone generally had a chance to even compete. You might not end up on the varsity squad, but playing JV is still doing a sport.</p>
<p>I compare this to my friends’ experiences going to schools in larger cities. Starting from early middle school, school sponsored activities begin actively cutting students. If you didn’t know that you wanted to be a swimmer before entering high school, it is suddenly too late to do so. Even once you’re on the team, though, you aren’t safe. The fact that cuts exist at all means that there is a constant existential need to focus on the single activity.</p>
<p>I can relate to that now. The looming deadline of my thesis does make it harder for me to do other activities, because I am constantly asking myself if the time would be better spent doing something else. I feel beyond blessed to have ended up going to a small college, which gave me the chance to continue being an amateur.<a href="#fn012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Returning to the point of the question, and hoping that I don’t go on the rant again, my initial answer to why someone should care about science is that they once did, and life is better when we care about more things. As the PE<a href="#fn013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref3"><sup>3</sup></a> stressed, the first and primary goal of science communication should always be to have a conversation with someone else. Too, the primary goal of a conversation should always be setting the stage for the next conversation. In a conversation about science, the most important thing is to share feelings, not facts.</p>
<p>There’s a recent Pope that made a similar point about conversion. People are convinced by experience and emotion, not by raw facts. Even within the sciences, we know this to be true. The scientists that everyone points to as the best lecturers and teachers are the ones whose presentation styles are animated and draw the listener in.</p>
<p>So, if someone asks me why they should care about science, my first question to them should<a href="#fn014" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref4"><sup>4</sup></a> be what they care about right now. It is important that the question doesn’t feel like an attack or a deflection, so framing it as something like “I don’t really know you well enough to know why you should or shouldn’t care about science. What do you care about right now?” Then, and importantly, I need to actively listen to what they say, not to find the way that I can tie their interest to science, but simply because they’re a full human, and deserve to be listened to.</p>
<p>Somewhere I need to do a reflection on how cults work, in part, by making people feel seen, and how I can weaponize<a href="#fn015" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref5"><sup>5</sup></a> that knowledge towards good.<a href="#fn016" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>However, despite the fact that the first goal of my science communication is a conversation and the second goal is therefore to have another conversation, the third goal is to make them leave the conversation at least a little more pro-science. As a result, it does still become important to figure out why they don’t care about science. I have the internal idea<a href="#fn017" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref7"><sup>7</sup></a> that people will generally tell you why they dislike or don’t care about something better if you ask them tangentially related questions. Deep in my heart of hearts, I do legitimately believe that most people want the world to be a better place. At the end of the day, if I cannot agree with someone on that basic premise, I might just have to accept that I cannot communicate with them about science.</p>
<p>However, wanting the world to be a better place still leaves a lot of room for disagreement. In general, I think that the quest for knowledge is a good in and of itself, not simply as a means to something else. Many people, however, want knowledge to have a use, especially knowledge that their tax dollars support, and that is also reasonable.</p>
<p>I can’t ever imagine “you pay far less to fund science than you do to (insert other thing)” will ever be a useful line of questioning. So, what else can I say that researching prebiotic astrochemistry is good for? An answer I probably shouldn’t and won’t give but is true is that it keeps the sort of people who would do that kind of work from doing something else. We all know enough horror stories of mad science to not take the idea of keeping scientists placated at least a little bit seriously.</p>
<p>Many medical students do research as undergraduates before entering medical school. Giving them the chance to do research of their own equips them with the tools to better understand new advances in medicine. In general, there are plenty of versions of “funding any research is good because research helps people.”</p>
<p>A fair counterpoint is that we could get all those benefits by studying something useful. This is where we get to the real issue with communicating the need for science funding: there is very rarely a way to know what discovery will be important in a hundred years’<a href="#fn018" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref8"><sup>8</sup></a> time. Newton’s experiments with light were nothing more than a fun diversion until quantum mechanics became relevant. Gauss’s understanding of electricity and magnetism only became important to the average person when we began using electricity.</p>
<p>On the other hand, all the research we did into vacuum tubes for computing was, in retrospect, not really needed. We now know how to make semiconductors without these tubes, and so computing can be done with far smaller pieces. Without knowing what a semiconductor is, there would have been no way for people to research them. Without a need for semiconductors in computing, the fact that silicon can easily be made to take on different semiconducting properties is mostly irrelevant.</p>
<p>All that to say, the biggest reason to fund any given research that sounds silly is that we never know where important facts will be discovered.</p>
<p>There is also the secondary point, which is that almost<a href="#fn019" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref9"><sup>9</sup></a> any research can be made to sound ridiculous when framed by a bad actor. I do not know if all research can be framed to sound as though it has merit, but I think any research worth doing can be. Then again, I think that “we didn’t know this and now we do” is a totally valid answer.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s the final set of arguments, which is that a lot of seemingly frivolous hard science is in fact just basic science. Exactly one person needs to measure most things in chemistry and physics, and then everyone else can use that information forever. I do not need to take the gas phase rotational spectrum of water to know if it’s in my sample. The more tools we have, the better we can build.</p>
<p>So, I guess that one of my answers does really boil down to the fact that having more tools available is always better, even if using more of them isn’t better for any specific case. Without looking into the future, there is no way to know what problems tomorrow will bring, and so there is no way of knowing what information will be needed then. Even moreso, without knowing what question to ask, we cannot hope to find an answer.</p>
<h1 id="daily-reflection-2-april-2025">Daily Reflection: 2 April 2025)</h1>
<p>N.B. Since I’ve realized that I will often give up halfway through a post, I’ve decided that I’m going to start each post now with the daily set of reflections.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Intentionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At least hourly, stand up, drink water, take two deep breaths, and do a stretch of some sort</p>
<p>This went pretty well yesterday! I think I forgot about it a little while TAing, but not too terribly much</p></li>
<li><p>Be proactive about avoiding overwhelm and when feeling overwhelmed, stop and figure out why.</p>
<p>I think I did ok about this. Yesterday I did feel horrible more than a few times, and simply realizing that wow I’m fundamentally just really sad about my mom is something that helped the overwhelm pass.</p></li>
<li><p>Light a candle and read by candlelight each night. Along with this, leave all electronics outside of the bedroom and/or move them away at least an hour before bed time.</p>
<p>For some reason the flame in my candle really wildly swings every few seconds, which made reading a bit of a pain. I did, however, remove all the electronics from my room and read before bed, which was really peaceful.</p></li>
<li><p>Candle time in the morning before electronics. Use the time for prayer Did not have candle time this morning, but I did also realize that there’s no real point to my morning alarm, because I would rather be well rested than up early, so I’ve now set the alarm such that it is only for the absolute latest that I can get up and not miss anything.<a href="#fn0110" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref10"><sup>10</sup></a> I did try to pray the chaplet to St. Michael, then remembered that I don’t have it memorized. Will print it out to solve that issue</p></li>
<li><p>Focus on good posture, especially straight back and making sure that neck isn’t awkwardly positioned.</p>
<p>In general I’ve been trying, but it does really feel like it puts a lot of pressure on the part of my back just below my ribcage, which I’m not sure about the reason for or health of. I should look that up tomorrow</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t waste time, and in particular, be mindful about making sure to take breaks and rest. Especially make sure to do rest which revitalizes the me of tomorrow, rather than rest which simply keeps me in stasis.</p>
<p>I did 45 minutes of stretching yesterday when I got home from grocery shopping, and it did do a lot to revitalize me before bed. That feels a little strange, but I mean that it took me from feeling exhausted and run down to just like sleepy, if that makes sense.</p></li>
<li><p>Interpersonal Relationships:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Figure out what belongs in a normal letter to a friend.</p>
<p>I have requested a number of books on etiquette from the 20th century, and we will see if any of them end up being useful for what I need.</p></li>
<li><p>Get back into writing letters.</p>
<p>Going to my cell in the library is a bit of a journey, but it’s also something that I know beyond the shadow of a doubt is good for me, so that’s a difficult tradeoff. It might help me to start actively working to spend time doing the reading I need to do in there.</p></li>
<li><p>Work to message friends at desired intervals.</p>
<p>I still need to make the list of friends. That might be a tomorrow task, though.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Professional:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Do the Thesis and other research requirements. Upcoming deadlines:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Brain dump about science communication (Overdue)</p></li>
<li><p>Brain dump a publicly accessible chapter (Overdue)</p></li>
<li><p>Have final convergences for the results I’m trying to reproduce (due 4/4)</p></li>
<li><p>Draft of the first paper (due end of month, but I want to make sure that I’ve reupdated it sooner than later)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Only do the work I feel called to when I’ve finished the tasks set to me for the day or outside of normal working hours (post 1725)</p></li>
<li><p>Start making the giant citation document so that I don’t have to search for citations later.</p></li>
<li><p>Work towards future career:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Do the reflections that were recommended to me (mostly focused around why I care about science communication. See above</p></li>
<li><p>Figure out the difference between my public-facing and field-facing presentation affects. As I focus on becoming a better presenter, I need to become aware of the difference and how to switch them.</p></li>
<li><p>Need to look for jobs</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Health:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Spiritual:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Get back into the Lenten goals (pray chaplet of St. Michael, give money equal to amount I’m spending on myself, stop scrolling social media, stop playing video games)</p>
<p>I did try to pray it the chaplet this morning, but I forgot most of the parts.<a href="#fn0111" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Be intentional about prayer. That means both making time for prayer and actually doing it.</p>
<p>I prayed a little before bed and a little this morning, which is progress. I’m also being better about praying before meals again, which is good for me.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Physical:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start focusing on posture again, especially while sitting.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, I do feel like this makes it harder for me to breathe. Will have to look up why that is and figure out if it’s that those muscles are too weak or what.</p></li>
<li><p>Go to group fitness classes more regularly and more often.</p>
<p>Yesterday I instead, as mentioned above, did a self guided workout for about 45 minutes while catching up on some content creators whose content I enjoy. It was pretty nice, but I did not push my core or other parts as much as in a normal class. Then again, I let myself spend more time in many of the poses, which was also good. I did find that my mat is stretchy, especially on movements<a href="#fn0112" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref12"><sup>12</sup></a> like downward dog. It’s wild to me that I can touch my toes for the first time maybe ever, but certainly since college started. It feels nice</p></li>
<li><p>Feed myself simply and healthily. Healthy here means trying to generally avoid processing.</p>
<p>I’ve been eating oatmeal for breakfast on work mornings, and it’s been generally good for keeping me going through the day. I have even been generally good about remembering to bring in some frozen blueberries or mixed berries, which add health, taste, and color!</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Mental:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clean Life:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Remove dirt and clutter from physical spaces (standard definition of clean):</p>
<p>I’m still working to play catch up on this, but I have been trying. This morning I cleaned up some clutter, and if I have energy tonight, I will do so again. The hard part is absolutely that I have too much stuff, and I need to be more intentional about getting rid of things.<a href="#fn0113" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>At least once a week, each room has nothing on the floor</p></li>
<li><p>At least once a week, all surfaces which are not inherently storage are cleared off</p></li>
<li><p>At least once every two weeks, each room is vacuumed</p></li>
<li><p>At least once every month, all non-storage surfaces are explicitly washed/cleaned</p></li>
<li><p>At least once a week, I get rid of at least one item that I notice (meaning throw away or in rare circumstances gift or donate)</p></li>
<li><p>Clean sight lines. Is my space set up in a way that orients me towards my goals for the space? If not, how can I make it so?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Spend time each day thinking about the goals for the day, and getting them out of my head and onto the page.</p>
<p>I’ve spend about 15 minutes on this so far today, and that doesn’t count the three or four minutes that I spent planning the work I’m going to do today. Still, I think that it was time well spent.</p></li>
<li><p>Continue to explicitly confront the voice in my head that says that people hate me.</p>
<p>Actively did so yesterday! Left an encounter with a friend feeling really angry, asked myself why, and realized that the feelings were misplaced.<a href="#fn0114" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reading</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start reading and returning the library books I have.</p>
<p>Not so much yesterday, but that’s ok. It remains a lower priority than the other activities I have been doing.</p></li>
<li><p>Finish the book on mindfulness I started. (also make a list of the exercises in the book and try them out)</p>
<p>Read some yesterday! It was nice, and shockingly emotionally connective for me, which is always strange.</p></li>
<li><p>Read more poetry</p>
<p>This is more aspirational than anything else. Still, it would behoove me to sign up for a poem of a day somewhere.<a href="#fn0115" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Music:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Work on guitar</p>
<p>Practiced a little bit by candlelight last night! I need to bring home the exercises for guitar that are on my desk.</p></li>
<li><p>Learn the songs that jam partner suggested and/or requested I learn</p></li>
<li><p>Get back into the album.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Write poetry more often, ideally nightly.</p>
<p>Wrote some last night! Or, at least, wrote some words that I intended as poetry. Without strict meter and rhyming, I find that I can’t really distinguish between prose and poetry at a fundamental level. Probably good to talk to someone about this.</p></li>
<li><p>Find a way to add meta data to my blog posts and then add the meta data</p></li>
<li><p>Not only write blogs, but also post them.</p>
<p>Did so yesterday, will do again today</p></li>
<li><p>Get back into writing the web novel</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Other hobbies, do them.</p></li>
</ul></li>

<h1 id="monthly-reflection"><a href="reflection-march-25.html">Monthly Reflection</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2025 April 1</p>
<h1 id="draft-2-1-april-2025">Draft 2: 1 April 2025</h1>
<p>N.B. the two drafts are markedly different, and they cover somewhat very different things</p>
<p>Time has continued its ceaseless march ever forward, and marching, passed March by. My experience has been detaching from time again, which isn’t great, but is true. With that in mind, I will really reaffirm here my goal to write on this site more often. I do not know what happened this past month, or really this year so far, and I do not like that.</p>
<p>Still, in the interest of giving myself grace, it’s good to remember why I wasn’t blogging. The past few days in particular, I was really focused on the derivation for some equations that I just realized might be helpful for me. Looking with a little more intention, I realize that I let myself be consumed by that project, and the consumption is not particularly healthy. Moving forward, I want to be better at keeping myself outside of obsession.</p>
<p>Five great things from March:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Tentative approval for my defense timeline</p></li>
<li><p>Received an award for outstanding service to the university</p></li>
<li><p>Got a massage</p></li>
<li><p>Had friends respond positively when I asked them about contact rates</p></li>
<li><p>Started writing choral music</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This coming April, five things I’m looking forward to are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Leading the science experiment this coming Saturday.</p></li>
<li><p>Going to a friend’s thesis defense</p></li>
<li><p>Finishing and submitting my first first author paper</p></li>
<li><p>Writing more with a close friend</p></li>
<li><p>Becoming more of the person that I would like to be, both by changing and by changing my goals.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Particular areas I want to focus on this month:<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Prayer. This has been at the bottom of my priorities for months now, and I am finally starting to notice the consequences. I want to reconnect with the Almighty, and that requires prayer.</p></li>
<li><p>Physical health. I know that I have more energy and feel better when I work out more often, and so I really need to make that an emphasis</p></li>
<li><p>Avoiding obsession. I know that I can let myself get stuck on a problem until I solve it, and I also know that doing so means that I fall behind on everything else that I want to be doing. When I catch myself obsessing, stop.</p></li>
<li><p>Intentionality in general. I want to make sure that what I do and plan to do is what I want to be doing. In particular, I want to make the choices I want to do the path of least resistance, which I think means making more schedules and forcing myself to follow them.<a href="#fn022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Working on hobbies. I know that I feel more complete as a human when I do things other than research. More than that, the time I spend on research is improved by taking time off.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While that is five items, many of them intersect in a variety of ways. All in all, I know that I am better when I don’t rely on my internal memory, but instead have it extended into a readily available source. I need that source, however, to not be as messy as my own mind, which is its own problem. Still, the better I become at setting and enforcing boundaries, the better all of this will become as well.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing the person I become, and I look forward to seeing the person I was and am as I continue to reflect.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-1-april-2025">Draft 1: 1 April 2025</h1>
<p>It’s been somehow another month. Time continues its aggressive march forward, and it has left March behind. Despite the fact that I had exactly three (3)<a href="#fn023" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref3"><sup>3</sup></a> blog posts for the month, it seems good for me to do my usual monthly reflection.</p>
<p>I really haven’t been doing much blogging at all this year, which is a bit of a shame, though tracks with the fact that I have no real sense of how time has moved this year. Still, it’s always good for me to have some highlights from the previous month:<a href="#fn024" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Met with my committee and set a tentative thesis defense date! It’s so wild to me that they all think that I can be done in just a few more months.</p></li>
<li><p>Got an award for dedication to giving talks to the broader state-wide community</p></li>
<li><p>Got positive responses from my friends when I asked them all about the rate that they wanted me to message them.</p></li>
<li><p>Got a massage!</p></li>
<li><p>Started writing choral music again.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s interesting to me that a full majority of these are things that happened to me<a href="#fn025" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref5"><sup>5</sup></a>, but that’s probably fine.</p>
<p>What are five things that I’m looking forward to in the coming month?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Leading a science exploration day this Saturday!</p></li>
<li><p>Going to a friend’s thesis defense</p></li>
<li><p>Finishing and submitting my first first author paper</p></li>
<li><p>Going to a farmer’s<a href="#fn026" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref6"><sup>6</sup></a> market</p></li>
<li><p>Writing more with a close friend!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Normally I would now go through the goals that I had last month and see how I did, and then create the goals for the coming month. However, my goals list is currently a living document, so that’s kind of taken care of. Still, probably good to at least reflect on them as a macro level.</p>
<p>I still like the division between Professional, Health, and Other, and I think that the upcoming deadlines will be nice as well. It might make more sense for me to move upcoming deadlines into the Professional, especially since effectively all of the deadlines that I have are in relation to the thesis I’m writing. Professional otherwise just reminds me that wow I am not doing a good job of actually working towards a future career.</p>
<p>Health being broken into mental, physical, and spiritual still seems good, and the order seems reasonable to me still. I think that the cleaning goals will become reasonable once I’ve achieved them a single time. Still, that does mean that I need to start prioritizing them more. Today, much as I want to work on the idea for my research that I had as I was getting ready to leave work on Friday, I should<a href="#fn027" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref7"><sup>7</sup></a> probably instead go home and clean, especially since I’ll be busy tomorrow night.</p>
<p>Cleaning my life belonging in mental health remains kind of odd to me, but I can’t really say that I disagree with it, since I do feel like it’s my mental health that suffers the most from not having a clean life. I’ve added the goal of candlelight time each night, and I’m realizing that part of my problem is not feeling like I have a comfortable place to sit in my apartment outside of my bed. I don’t know if that means that I should get a new couch, a new chair, make a bundle of blankets and call it a sitting location, or what, but it is certainly something to consider. Goals for the day remains a good thing for me to do. Doing it this morning certainly helped me feel far less stressed and frantic than yesterday, where I did not take the time. In general, I think that I should probably just make more of an effort to be intentional, in the senses of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Do the things I know prevent me from feeling overwhelmed. (e.g. fill my water pitcher in the morning when entering work, check my list of tasks and make sure they’re still accurate)</p></li>
<li><p>When I feel overwhelmed, take the time to reflect and figure out why, and then write down what’s making me feel so.</p></li>
<li><p>Take at least a little time every hour, at the very least, to stand, stretch, drink water, and take two deep breaths.<a href="#fn028" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t really know where intention should go, but I think that I might like it to be its own category. This month, I think that physical health is more important to me than mental health<a href="#fn029" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Hmm, only having three physical health goals is a little lacking, for all that they do really make space for how I want to improve. I suppose that making an actual diet plan could be good<a href="#fn0210" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref10"><sup>10</sup></a>, and that might be a worthwhile activity for tonight while cleaning. Honestly, posture probably belongs in intentionality, so I’ll have it double listed.</p>
<p>Spiritual health remains the highest priority, so it remains at the top of the list, and I’m trying to figure out where to add the time. Candles in the morning for the chaplet could be a good starting spot. I’m realizing that the candle is better placed in intentionality, so have moved it there.</p>
<p>Interpersonal relationships I think should be moved into intentionality, since the goal of the interpersonal relationships is to be more intentional. I also think the bit about rest can be there as well! Wow this is getting revamped a ton.</p>
<p>I’d like to have a schedule of blog posts, which probably deserves to live somewhere outside of the daily posts. Then again, it could be a fun way for readers to see what they’re going to get. Eh, I think that it’s better to let me decide what needs to come on each day, for all that there are a number of posts that I do really feel like I need to have on certain days. I should make a list of the lists I’m trying to make right now<a href="#fn0211" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref11"><sup>11</sup></a>, because I know that otherwise I’ll forget it all.</p>
<p>Other is a category that’s grown just so much since the start of the document, and it’s probably worthwhile to consider breaking it apart. Right now I basically have the reading goal of getting through the library books, which is arguably an intentionality thing, doing music, writing things that could be fun, and other artistic endeavors I’d like to do. I have forgotten what embroidery physical relic means, and that’s a bit of a shame. Oh, duh, I literally just meant that I should embroider something.</p>
<p>What can I call these things? Hobbies? That’s probably a better term, and then I can move the other creative ideas that I generally have into their own, again separate, living document, since they’re not going to happen on the blog. I don’t really think that I need to be actively working on all of the hobbies at once, and so it could be good to treat them instead as potential options, which I put in my schedule as items for restorative rest.</p>
<p>Great, that’s really the whole new set of daily goals (which I’ve put in the modified Daily Reflection section, which I did not leave as a record of the changes I made, because that goal of the blog has been abandoned. Let’s clean up these thoughts in the next draft and then call it good to post.</p>
<h1 id="daily-reflection-1-april-2025">Daily Reflection: 1 April 2025)</h1>
<p>N.B. Since I’ve realized that I will often give up halfway through a post, I’ve decided that I’m going to start each post now with the daily set of reflections.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Intentionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At least hourly, stand up, drink water, take two deep breaths, and do a stretch of some sort</p></li>
<li><p>Be proactive about avoiding overwhelm and when feeling overwhelmed, stop and figure out why</p></li>
<li><p>Light a candle and read by candlelight each night. Along with this, leave all electronics outside of the bedroom and/or move them away at least an hour before bed time.</p></li>
<li><p>Candle time in the morning before electronics. Use the time for prayer</p></li>
<li><p>Focus on good posture, especially straight back and making sure that neck isn’t awkwardly positioned.<a href="#fn0212" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Don’t waste time, and in particular, be mindful about making sure to take breaks and rest. Especially make sure to do rest which revitalizes the me of tomorrow, rather than rest which simply keeps me in stasis.</p>
<p>This weekend wasn’t great for non-stasis activities, but I’ve got ideas for how to do so moving forward.</p></li>
<li><p>Interpersonal Relationships:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Figure out what belongs in a normal letter to a friend.</p></li>
<li><p>Get back into writing letters.</p>
<p>Wrote one on Sunday!</p></li>
<li><p>Work to message friends at desired intervals.</p>
<p>I need to make a list of the friends who responded and their preferred intervals.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Professional:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Do the Thesis and other research requirements. Upcoming deadlines:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Brain dump about science communication (Overdue)<a href="#fn0213" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Brain dump a publicly accessible chapter (Overdue)</p></li>
<li><p>Revise the overview of my program, which also means finishing writing it up<a href="#fn0214" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref14"><sup>14</sup></a> (Overdue)</p></li>
<li><p>Have final convergences for the results I’m trying to reproduce (due 4/4)<a href="#fn0215" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Draft of the first paper (due end of month, but I want to make sure that I’ve reupdated it sooner than later)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Only do the work I feel called to when I’ve finished the tasks set to me for the day or outside of normal working hours (post 1725)</p></li>
<li><p>Start making the giant citation document so that I don’t have to search for citations later.</p></li>
<li><p>Work towards future career:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Read the recommended readings about science communication. Just did.</p></li>
<li><p>Do the reflections that were recommended to me (mostly focused around why I care about science communication)</p>
<p>Tomorrow.</p></li>
<li><p>Figure out the difference between my public-facing and field-facing presentation affects. As I focus on becoming a better presenter, I need to become aware of the difference and how to switch them.</p></li>
<li><p>Need to look for jobs</p>
<p>Have started! Now I need to start actually filling out applications, etc.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Health:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Spiritual:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Get back into the Lenten goals (pray chaplet of St. Michael, give money equal to amount I’m spending on myself, stop scrolling social media, stop playing video games)</p></li>
<li><p>Be intentional about prayer. That means both making time for prayer and actually doing it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Physical:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start focusing on posture again, especially while sitting.</p></li>
<li><p>Go to group fitness classes more regularly and more often.</p>
<p>I think that a secondary goal could be that if I don’t go in the morning and there’s not a class I can make it to in the evening that I’ll just do one myself at home. I have a yoga mat and a family subscription to some yoga classes.</p></li>
<li><p>Feed myself simply and healthily. Healthy here means trying to generally avoid processing.</p>
<p>Honestly, I didn’t realize how much I actively crave artificial dyes. I still have some candy that was gifted to me, so I’m also going to keep eating it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Mental:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clean Life:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Remove dirt and clutter from physical spaces (standard definition of clean):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At least once a week, each room has nothing on the floor</p></li>
<li><p>At least once a week, all surfaces which are not inherently storage are cleared off</p></li>
<li><p>At least once every two weeks, each room is vacuumed</p></li>
<li><p>At least once every month, all non-storage surfaces are explicitly washed/cleaned</p></li>
<li><p>At least once a week, I get rid of at least one item that I notice (meaning throw away or in rare circumstances gift or donate)</p></li>
<li><p>Clean sight lines. Is my space set up in a way that orients me towards my goals for the space? If not, how can I make it so?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So far I’m behind, but the goal right now is really getting to a baseline where that’s possible</p></li>
<li><p>Spend time each day thinking about the goals for the day, and getting them out of my head and onto the page.</p>
<p>Yesterday I started by just working and wow I felt horribly overwhelmed right away. Today I spent like 10 minutes looking over the schedule I had previously set for myself, and I feel much more ready for the month</p></li>
<li><p>Continue to explicitly confront the voice in my head that says that people hate me.</p>
<p>Have been, and will continue to do so.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reading</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start reading and returning the library books I have.</p>
<p>I want to set the goal of at least one book a week, but that may not be possible, given so much stuff.</p></li>
<li><p>Finish the book on mindfulness I started. (also make a list of the exercises in the book and try them out)</p></li>
<li><p>Read more poetry</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Music:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Work on guitar</p></li>
<li><p>Learn the songs that jam partner suggested and/or requested I learn</p></li>
<li><p>Get back into the album.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Write poetry more often, ideally nightly.</p>
<p>I should really start doing this again, and also on Sunday I lit a candle and it made my night better. If I do those together I think that it will be better for me.</p></li>
<li><p>Find a way to add meta data to my blog posts and then add the meta data<a href="#fn0216" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Not only write blogs, but also post them.</p></li>
<li><p>Get back into writing the web novel</p></li>
<li><p>Write other fiction. Ideas include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The book I made a document about in late January</p></li>
<li><p>A story told through bullet points</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Embroidery:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Make pattern</p></li>
<li><p>Make embroidery from pattern</p></li>
<li><p>Explore stitches other than the single stitch I’ve used exclusively for all of the projects I’ve finished.</p></li>
</ul></li>

<h1 id="for-twenty-six"><a href="twenty-six.html">26 for Twenty Six</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 27 March 2025</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-27-march-2025">Draft 1: 27 March 2025</h1>
<p>This will officially be my <a href="twenty-four.html">third</a> <a href="twenty-five.html">year</a> attempting to do a number of new tasks over the course of the year.<a href="#fn031" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> I more and more realize that this has become less of a way for me to start doing more new things and much more a way of making sure that I recognize the many ways that I’m continuing to grow as a person.</p>
<p>Even though I’m well into this year of my life, I still want to have finished with this by the time I turn twenty seven! Let’s see what things I’ve already done, and then start to consider what else I want to do:<a href="#fn032" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Learned to live with a single living parent.<a href="#fn033" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Saw Hozier live in concert<a href="#fn034" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Checked in with most of my friends to make sure that I was communicating appropriately. That’s really mostly me accepting that I like to have expectations explicitly stated and trusting my friends enough to do so.</p></li>
<li><p>Officially gave up on my web novel.<a href="#fn035" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Seasoned a wok!<a href="#fn036" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Sharpened my own knives at home<a href="#fn037" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Sat Shiva! It was a really fantastic experience, in as much as anything about grieving can be good. Watching someone else near to me deal with the loss of a parent without Shiva<a href="#fn038" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref8"><sup>8</sup></a> really highlighted just how beneficial it was in terms of my ability to process my grief and accept the way that life is forever going to be different for me.</p></li>
<li><p>Did a large embroidery pattern<a href="#fn039" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Was the entirety of the stage crew for a cabaret. I don’t quite know how to phrase this one, but it’s mostly that I was the sole person for staging all the props and scenes for a number of small acts. It was kind of weird having such responsibility</p></li>
<li><p>Joined a book club with some church friends<a href="#fn0310" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Joined a community choir! It’s TTBB which is also really cool</p></li>
<li><p>Went to adult night at the local conservatory (nature not music)</p></li>
<li><p>Started going to a weekly watch party for a television show. I really don’t think that I’ve ever really kept up with a show as it aired each week</p></li>
<li><p>Did an unassisted downward dog!<a href="#fn0311" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Tried a bunch of different fitness classes!<a href="#fn0312" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Started teaching children’s religious education</p></li>
<li><p>Designed a novel search pattern<a href="#fn0313" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Was explicitly acknowledged in a Ph.D. defense not as a formality<a href="#fn0314" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Started using the university-wide high throughput computing center</p></li>
<li><p>Got an award for service: I apparently gave talks in the greatest number of counties through the university’s talk program</p></li>
<li><p>Learned how to crochet flowers</p></li>
<li><p>Realized that my life is better when I wear good noise cancelling headphones, bought a pair, and became comfortable wearing them in public</p></li>
<li><p>Will<a href="#fn0315" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref15"><sup>15</sup></a> lead an interactive science demo with children.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Wildly, that’s already twenty three items. Many of them are things that I don’t really think that I would count if given the option, and so let’s pare the list down to things that I actually consider novel:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Learned to live with a single living parent.</p></li>
<li><p>Saw Hozier live in concert</p></li>
<li><p>Seasoned a wok!</p></li>
<li><p>Sharpened my own knives at home</p></li>
<li><p>Sat shiva<a href="#fn0316" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Did a large embroidery pattern<a href="#fn0317" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Did the entire stage managing and crewing for a small cabaret production</p></li>
<li><p>Joined a community choir! It’s TTBB which is also really cool</p></li>
<li><p>Went to adult night at the local conservatory (nature not music)</p></li>
<li><p>Started going to a weekly watch party for a television show. I really don’t think that I’ve ever really kept up with a show as it aired each week</p></li>
<li><p>Did an unassisted downward dog!<a href="#fn0318" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Started teaching children’s religious education</p></li>
<li><p>Got an award for service: I apparently gave talks in the greatest number of counties through the university’s talk program</p></li>
<li><p>Learned how to crochet flowers</p></li>
<li><p>Will<a href="#fn0319" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref19"><sup>19</sup></a> lead an interactive science demo with children.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>That’s still 15! That means I need to do eleven in the next four months, which is more than doable, hopefully! That’s a relief, honestly, and really points out just how much my mind lies to me. I did really believe that I had not done anything novel this year, entirely because I thought that my mom’s death had been all consuming. It’s nice to know that that isn’t true! Only two and a half of the items are explicitly related to that, and the rest I don’t think were impacted at all! Wild how life continues to go on even when I want it to stop, and wild that I continued to actively live even when I felt like I was behind a curtain watching life pass me by.</p>
<p>N.B. This is the living list of ways that I want to take care of myself and/or goals that I have and/or things that I want to do. I’m planning to start adding the shorter term goals that I have to this as well.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Professional:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Continue to work at work</p></li>
<li><p>Work towards future career:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Read the recommended readings about science communication.</p></li>
<li><p>Do the reflections that were recommended to me (mostly focused around why I care about science communication)</p></li>
<li><p>Figure out the difference between my public-facing and field-facing presentation affects. As I focus on becoming a better presenter, I need to become aware of the difference and how to switch them</p></li>
<li><p>Need to look for jobs</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Health:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Spiritual:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Get back into the Lenten goals (pray chaplet of St. Michael, give money equal to amount I’m spending on myself, stop scrolling social media, stop playing video games)</p></li>
<li><p>Be intentional about prayer. That means both making time for prayer and actually doing it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Mental:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clean my Life:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Remove dirt and clutter from physical spaces (standard definition of clean). I’m going to change this goal to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At least once a week, each room has nothing on the floor</p></li>
<li><p>At least once a week, all surfaces which are not inherently storage are cleared off</p></li>
<li><p>At least once every two weeks, each room is vacuumed</p></li>
<li><p>At least once every month, all non-storage surfaces are explicitly washed/cleaned</p></li>
<li><p>At least once a week, I get rid of at least one item that I notice (meaning throw away or in rare circumstances gift or donate)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Spend time each day thinking about the goals for the day, and getting them out of my head and onto the page. I still don’t know how to do this, but I also feel like I have less explicit goals these days.</p></li>
<li><p>Start reading and returning the library books I have. I’m going to try to do better at this, but I don’t know how</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t waste time, and in particular, be mindful about making sure to take breaks and rest. Especially make sure to do rest which revitalizes the me of tomorrow, rather than rest which simply keeps me in stasis</p></li>
<li><p>Clean sight lines. Is my space set up in a way that orients me towards my goals for the space? If not, how can I make it so? Darn curse of entropy.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Interpersonal Relationships:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Figure out what belongs in a normal letter to a friend.</p></li>
<li><p>Get back into writing letters.</p></li>
<li><p>Continue to explicitly confront the voice in my head that says that people hate me</p></li>
<li><p>Work to message friends at desired intervals.</p></li>
<li><p>Potentially start giving small gifts, though many people also dislike clutter, so think carefully about that one. Have started giving friends things as I have them, and they’re well received. Thoughtfulness is the key.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Physical:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Go to group fitness classes more regularly and more often. Gym is closed this week, I learned yesterday. I really need to start going to yoga in the mornings, especially since my afternoons and evenings are about to get really full.</p></li>
<li><p>Feed myself simply and healthily. Healthy here means trying to generally avoid processing.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Other:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Music:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Work on guitar</p></li>
<li><p>Learn the songs that jam partner suggested and/or requested I learn</p></li>
<li><p>Get back into the album. I was jamming with the friend on Saturday and they talked me up to their partner about having written music. I couldn’t remember the chords for one of the songs, and that’s kind of sad to me.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Write poetry more often, ideally nightly. Wrote some free prose yesterday!</p></li>
<li><p>Find a way to add meta data to my blog posts and then add the meta data<a href="#fn0320" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Not only write blogs, but also post them. Ideas include:<a href="#fn0321" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>26 for 26 Wow! Lookie here</p></li>
<li><p>Listening to an album and writing about my experience with it. Unsure if this is best done with one I have prior knowledge of or a new one, but regardless, sit and listen without other stimuli. One of my lab mates and I have been exchanging albums, so this could be fun</p></li>
<li><p>The arts I’ve been doing lately</p></li>
<li><p>Why I care about science and communicating it<a href="#fn0322" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>My general disposition to authority. I’m not entirely sure what that meant, but it was a note I wrote to myself while half asleep, so I’ll leave it here.</p></li>
<li><p>How to feed myself. How I am, how I would like to, and what the difference is</p></li>
<li><p>Motivation, autotelic motivation, etc. etc.</p></li>
<li><p>The idea I have that knowledge (music, writing, science, etc.) is revealed, not acquired</p></li>
<li><p>Understanding the human experience, esp. in/re. writing</p></li>

<h1 id="exploring-hesitation-to-restart-web-novel"><a href="why-not-write-web-novel.html">Exploring Hesitation to Restart Web Novel</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2025 March 26</p>
<h1 id="draft-2-26-march-2025">Draft 2: 26 March 2025</h1>
<p>I do really love a good metanarrative, and this blog post might be a good example of one. I was<a href="#fn041" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> wondering why I have not been writing my web novel. I thought that I would<a href="#fn042" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> have the time, energy, and motivation to write another draft yesterday. Instead, 13 hours after leaving home for work, I returned. Everything that I planned to do at home last night took longer than I had assumed it would, and as a result I did not end up writing my chapter.</p>
<p>I forget who initially told me this, but someone once told me that there’s no such thing as free time. That is, anything that I do has to come at the expense of something else that I am otherwise doing.</p>
<p>Somewhere else, I’ve seen that I need to have some amount of my time as rest. For a while, I think that the novel was a form of rest for me, but it absolutely stopped being one by the time that I stopped writing it.</p>
<p>With both of these in mind, it’s obvious to me that I have been less able to do things lately than I was before.<a href="#fn043" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref3"><sup>3</sup></a> If I want to be better about extending grace to myself, I need to make this a question stemming from curiosity, not judgement.<a href="#fn044" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>So, let’s go through the reasons that I might write a web novel, and see how motivating they are to me right now.<a href="#fn045" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>In general, I would love if more of the things that I did were autotelic.<a href="#fn046" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Actually, I don’t know if that’s true. Some use autotelic to mean that a task is undertaken without external goals, and is therefore motivated by the thing itself. It gets to intrinsic and instrumental motivations.</p>
<p>Do I have intrinsic motivation to write?</p>
<p>Broader, do I have intrinsic motivations?</p>
<p>Even broader, is it better for me to have intrinsic motivations?</p>
<p>I guess things which are good in themselves are considered intrinsic motivations. I more and more realize that I think that I subscribe to a version of Divine Command Theory, which means that good is itself an extrinsically defined thing. However, since I also think that goodness is a moral constant, I suppose that practically speaking I can treat things that I do because I believe that they are Divinely ordained as good, and therefore intrinsically valuable. I’ll even go the step further and say that I’m going to use intrinsically motivating as good in itself, where good means I think that it, on the whole, helps to bring the world towards G-d.</p>
<p>Ok, diversion aside, let’s say that an autotelic action is an action I undertake without the explicit or implied belief that I will have an extrinsic benefit from doing it. For me, working out is not an autotelic action, because I exercise to stay in shape. Practicing my guitar is not autotelic, because I do so to be better at guitar. Jamming with a friend is an autotelic action, because the jamming is the goal.<a href="#fn047" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>This helps me think about the book. What would it mean for me to be writing the book as its own end? I think that it would mean that I’m writing it to figure out where the story leads me.<a href="#fn048" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref8"><sup>8</sup></a> That is certainly a motivation I have. The initial premise for the book had the main character becoming a terrorist in the final book.<a href="#fn049" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref9"><sup>9</sup></a> I’m less and less sure how that will happen given the way that the story is playing out right now. In short, I think that there is at least a small part of me that wrote the book and would continue writing the book for its own sake.</p>
<p>Is writing the book a way for me to hone my writing skills? If so, then the motivation to write the book becomes<a href="#fn0410" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref10"><sup>10</sup></a> my motivation for improving my writing skills and my belief that writing the book improves my writing skills. Writing skills are not a monolith, however, and so I should really clarify what it means to improve at writing, at least insomuch as it relates to the book.</p>
<p>I believe that the primary ways the book helps me improve as a writer are that it teaches me to work on a deadline,<a href="#fn0411" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref11"><sup>11</sup></a> it teaches me to write faster,<a href="#fn0412" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref12"><sup>12</sup></a>, it helps me with considering a long narrative and pacing therein<a href="#fn0413" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref13"><sup>13</sup></a>, and it helps me to understand the general human experience.<a href="#fn0414" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>How motivated I am to improve in each of those regards is, as far as I can think of it, a function of how motivated I am to be good at the skill, how good at the skill I currently am, and the rate of progress that I think I will have in improving in the skill.<a href="#fn0415" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref15"><sup>15</sup></a> This means that my overall motivation for writing the book to improve myself is the sum of the motivations to improve each skill multiplied<a href="#fn0416" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref16"><sup>16</sup></a> with the likelihood that I will improve that skill by writing It can be better broken down into the sum of how quickly I think that writing the book will help me with a given skill multiplied by how motivated I am to be good at the skill, divided<a href="#fn0417" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref17"><sup>17</sup></a> by the skill I think that I have, or:</p>
<p>M(Write) = <span class="math inline">∏</span> M(Be good at skill) P(Writing will improve the Skill) E(Speed of improvement by writing)</p>
<p>Where M is the motivation overall, P is the probability, and E is the expectation value, which is itself a function of how easily I train the skill, how good the skill already is, how hard it is to train, and what it means to improve. In general, right now I do think that I am, at least consciously<a href="#fn0418" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref18"><sup>18</sup></a> very motivated to improve at writing. I think that writing the book will absolutely help me with keeping to deadlines, writing quickly, and understanding the human experience. I think that it will be neutral to slightly negative towards my ability to write in the scientific tone, but it might be positive at helping me to develop a specific register for writing, in such a way that I can then change it.</p>
<p>Ok, so the overall motivation appears positive in both regards, and I assume that if I have two positive motivations that they will add. Let’s hope that this will continue to be true, and all reasons I once wrote the book are positive motivators.</p>
<p>The next reason I had to consider was that I was motivated by the idea of making money. That’s really a few motivations hiding in a trench coat and pretending to be the same: the amount that money itself is a motivator, the amount that money is a decent stand-in for how much the external world values something, and the fact that one of the initial reasons I began to publish the book was my belief that I could write something better than the authors who make a lot on the platform. Money itself is not really a motivator for me, I more and more realize. Money as a stand-in for value is something that motivates me decently well, though not much better than anything that money can be exchanged for (pizza, ice cream, a medal).<a href="#fn0419" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Given that the majority of my readers are faceless entities leaving comments on a faceless book, money is really the only way for them to show value. I don’t think that I’m really motivated by the idea that other<a href="#fn0420" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref20"><sup>20</sup></a> authors are making more, because I’ve seen a number of what I consider really well written books also not have a significant monetary value associated on the website, and I’ve seen how much work the authors who turn major profits put into the business side of the writing.</p>
<p>A part of me also worries that being paid to write will make me want to write it less and/or value the book less. Given that I’ve made absolutely no steps towards monetizing the book, I don’t think that’s a motivation I should take into account. Comments are about as meaningful to me as I think that money would be, though there is the secondary point that something people spend money on is something that they’re more likely to recommend to a friend, which would increase my number of comments. All in all, though, I guess that I have to say possibility of monetization is probably just about zero as far as motivations go.</p>
<p>The next motivation I wanted to explore was the fact that I do things in order to prove<a href="#fn0421" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref21"><sup>21</sup></a> that I can. I think that I have effectively proven that I can write a web novel while doing a Ph.D., and I’ve proven that I can write something that others want to read. However, I haven’t proven that I can finish a story or tell a narrative that ends in a way that people like.<a href="#fn0422" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref22"><sup>22</sup></a> There is also the above portion of my motivation to prove that I can write something that others would pay for, but, as discussed, that’s relatively minor, especially since I’ve had comments saying that people are actively looking for a way to pay me. All in all, I’ll say the part of me that refuses to accept limits is a minor motivation at best.</p>
<p>My motivation to write something that my sibling enjoys is not something I’ve considered for a bit. Given the group chat I had with other friends who enjoyed commenting on the book as each new chapter released, I should probably extend it a little further. They all have other things to read which they enjoy, so I don’t really feel like I’m depriving them of much. Then again, I do also love when people like things that I made.<a href="#fn0423" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>And finally, a friend asked me how motivated I was to write the thing because I enjoyed it. That feels like a tough question, and was part of my question for an autotelic action. Does doing something because I think that I’ll enjoy it make it not autotelic? Great question, and one I’ve just reached out to a philosopher friend of mine about.</p>
<p>Ok, so all in all, I do have a fair amount of motivation to start writing the book. I do really believe that on some level the thing that was keeping me from writing was the fact that I didn’t have an explicit reason to point to for why I would. I have that now!</p>
<p>Now comes the hard question: how do I start writing it? I have been and plan to continue to be very busy at work. However, breaks are important, or so I’m told. I do often find that I stick myself into a rut while working, and forcing myself to take breaks is at least one way of confronting that part of me.</p>
<p>How often do I want to publish, how much do I want to be able to revise, how much will I revise, how long will each chapter be, how much of a backlog do I want to start with are all other questions. Let’s answer them now. I want to publish at least once a week, and ideally three times a week again, because I love a MWF release schedule. I would ideally like to be at least 10 chapters ahead so that I can hopefully avoid writing myself into a corner re: making a choice that has bad consequences in three more chapters. I don’t really think that I’ll revise much, in part because I don’t care that much about eking out every possible shred of skill into the book, and in part because a goal is to get better at quickly writing decent text. I want each chapter to be in the 2000 to 2500 word range, but will accept if they are again in the 1800 to 2200 range. I want to start with a ten chapter backlog, because that gives me the revision ability that I had hoped for.</p>
<p>How do I get the next twenty five thousand<a href="#fn0424" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref24"><sup>24</sup></a> words written? I set up time and space to do so. In general, I think that I can and probably should start setting time aside on Sundays again for personal growth related activities. They, like swimming or most things in my life, make every day slightly harder but in return make every day markedly easier.<a href="#fn0425" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>I’m a few weeks behind on keeping up with the living goals, but here it is!</p>
<p>N.B. I’ve decided to have the whole list of goals that I have for the month at the bottom of each posting, and I’ll delete entries as is relevant. That way I can track everything each day!</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Professional:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Thesis Work:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Work on the research within the thesis! Working!</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Be a better mentor: figure out how to take time to help underclassmen as they need help while still getting my own work done. Figured that out!</p></li>
<li><p>Leave work at work. I’ve set boundaries, am following them, and it’s working!</p></li>
<li><p>Work towards future career:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Read the recommended readings about science communication.</p></li>
<li><p>Do the reflections that were recommended to me (mostly focused around why I care about science communication)</p></li>
<li><p>Work on the materials for the science outreach event in April: the handout while they work and a page for the families to take home. Done! I think.</p></li>
<li><p>Figure out the difference between my public-facing and field-facing presentation affects. As I focus on becoming a better presenter, I need to become aware of the difference and how to switch them</p></li>
<li><p>Need to look for jobs</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Health:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Spiritual:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Do the Lenten goals. Haven’t been great about this one. Was doing ok at not listening to things constantly but then had a rough few days and found a new series.</p></li>
<li><p>Be intentional about prayer. That means both making time for prayer and actually doing it. Whoops.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Mental:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clean my Life:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Remove dirt and clutter from physical spaces (standard definition of clean). Doing better!</p></li>
<li><p>Spend time each day thinking about the goals for the day, and getting them out of my head and onto the page. Haven’t been doing great at, am slowly improving though! Need to find the optimal way that isn’t effortful</p></li>
<li><p>Start reading and returning the library books I have. Nope!</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t waste time, and in particular, be mindful about making sure to take breaks and rest. Kind of! Wasting time is somewhat happening</p></li>
<li><p>Clean sight lines. Is my space set up in a way that orients me towards my goals for the space? If not, how can I make it so? Darn curse of entropy.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Interpersonal Relationships:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Figure out what belongs in a normal letter to a friend.</p></li>
<li><p>Get back into writing letters.</p></li>
<li><p>Upon feeling a sense of dread at receiving a message from someone, remember that my lived experience says that most interactions are positive. More to the point, if my friends didn’t like me, they would tell me or at the very least would not continue to keep me in their life. If alone, speak something to that effect.  I’ve been doing this! It works wonders</p></li>
<li><p>Work to begin messaging friends.</p></li>
<li><p>Potentially start giving small gifts, though many people also dislike clutter, so think carefully about that one. Have started giving friends things as I have them, and they’re well received. Thoughtfulness is the key.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Physical:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Go to group fitness classes more regularly and more often.  Doing! Will keep though.</p></li>
<li><p>Feed myself simply and healthily. Mostly doing! Will keep</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Other:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Music:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Figure out something to work towards on guitar. Done! A friend asked me to play at his wedding, so will need to be good for that.</p></li>
<li><p>Work towards it</p></li>
<li><p>Spend time making efforts to improve as a singer, not simply passively singing. I’m getting rid of this goal because I no longer really have it.</p></li>
<li><p>Spend time making efforts to improve as a musician, not simply passively growing. see above.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Find the mental block towards writing my web novel. Wow! Look at this!</p></li>
<li><p>Write poetry more often, ideally nightly. Uhhhhhh nope, should restart though.</p></li>
<li><p>Not only write blogs, but also post them. Ideas include:<a href="#fn0426" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>26 for 26</p></li>
<li><p>Listening to an album and writing about my experience with it. Unsure if this is best done with one I have prior knowledge of or a new one, but regardless, sit and listen without other stimuli. One of my lab mates and I have been exchanging albums, so this could be fun</p></li>
<li><p>The arts I’ve been doing lately</p></li>
<li><p>Why I care about science and communicating it</p></li>
<li><p>the block between me and my web novel</p></li>
<li><p>My general disposition to authority. I’m not entirely sure what that meant, but it was a note I wrote to myself while half asleep, so I’ll leave it here.</p></li>
<li><p>How to feed myself.</p></li>
<li><p>Motivation, autotelic motivation, etc. etc.</p></li>
<li><p>The idea I have that knowledge (music, writing, science, etc.) is revealed, never gained (hard to express, meaning a great choice)</p></li>
<li><p>Understanding the human experience, esp. re. writing</p></li>
<li><p>Doing the work to improve myself and time discount</p></li>
<li><p>My writing style(s) and what they show</p></li>
<li><p>The four levels of mastery</p></li>
<li><p>A fiction: story told through bullet points</p></li>
<li><p>A short film: watching the screen as a breakup letter is written</p></li>
<li><p>“the only way out is through, and the only way through is forward”</p></li>
<li><p>Internal and External Arguments within and without<a href="#fn0427" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p></li>

<p>I keep musing within my musings about why it is that I’m not doing my web serial right now. I have a few reasons that have seemed plausible, and so I’m going to explore them as well as anything else that comes up as I muse today. I’ve been very into structuring documents lately<a href="#fn0428" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref28"><sup>28</sup></a>, but I want this to be less structured, if only to force myself out of the happy little boxes that I’m putting myself into.<a href="#fn0429" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>The first and most obvious reason an external observer might have for me no longer keeping up with the book<a href="#fn0430" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref30"><sup>30</sup></a> is the same reason that most people have expressed shock that I was writing a web serial at all: a graduate degree is intense and<a href="#fn0431" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref31"><sup>31</sup></a> all consuming. Especially now that I’m in the thesis writing stage, I really should<a href="#fn0432" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref32"><sup>32</sup></a> be spending a lot of my mental and physical writing space<a href="#fn0433" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref33"><sup>33</sup></a>, if not all of iton the thesis. However, I stopped writing the serial well before I started writing the thesis in earnest, and I was, in fact, able to write it while in a doctoral program, so that can’t be all of it. Whether it’s an actual reason or a convenient excuse I’m using is definitely up for debate, and I’m sure we’ll come back to this in time.</p>
<p>The second reason<a href="#fn0434" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref34"><sup>34</sup></a> that an external observer might use is the death of my mother this past October. Technically speaking, I stopped writing before October<a href="#fn0435" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref35"><sup>35</sup></a>, so that’s not explicitly timeline accurate. Of course, my mother was actively dying in late August, and had been in the hospital for a while before that, when it wasn’t clear if she was going to recover.</p>
<p>The death of my mother does tie neatly into the comment from the first reason: time. Not only was I grieving the loss of one of the pillars of my life, I am<a href="#fn0436" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref36"><sup>36</sup></a> playing catch up, or at least feel like I’m playing catch up for the time that I was less than productive while actively dealing with her dying. Even outside of time, grief is absolutely something that has taken up a lot of my mental space and time. Something that countless authors have spoken<a href="#fn0437" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref37"><sup>37</sup></a> about is the way that grief is almost all consuming at first.</p>
<p>The death of my mother also directly affects the novel for a really key reason that I’m not sure the average external reader would know: she was one of the main reasons that I wrote it. There was a solid month or so that I had to force myself to write each chapter, beginning with typing “the only way out is through, and the only way through is forward. This is something you can do to notably improve your mother’s experience as she deals with her cancer”, deleting it, and then writing the words to the book. When it became clear that she was not, in fact, reading it or likely to be able to read it again, that baseline reason disappeared from the logic. Given that it was, at least allegedly, the sole thing that got me writing for at least a month, the loss of the reason is definitely a big part of the loss of motivation. I think that I had forgotten or blocked out the fact that I used her cancer as an explicit reason to write the book.</p>
<p>Obviously, this ties to another barrier to writing: I associate the book with her and it’s painful to do things that I associate with her, knowing both that I am no longer able to connect with her about them and, maybe more importantly<a href="#fn0438" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref38"><sup>38</sup></a>, that the more I do them without her, the less I’ll associate the actions with her. That’s not just me fearmongering, it’s, as best as I understand it, the state of the field in psychology and neurology. Part of me was, and probably still is,<a href="#fn0439" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref39"><sup>39</sup></a> grasping tightly onto anything that I have that still reminds me of her. Looking at the blank text file where the book once was, or seeing the drafts that are still unwritten, though painful, also makes me immediately think about her. Grasping tightly is never healthy, though, and I think that I’m finally starting to loosen up my grip.<a href="#fn0440" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>I also have the general wall of starting anything.<a href="#fn0441" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref41"><sup>41</sup></a> I’ve taken enough time off of writing that restarting the book is just that, starting again.</p>
<p>Part of me is worried that fans will suddenly hate the way that the book is written.</p>
<p>Part of me knows that so much of the book was written with the general love for life and optimism that I have had for most of my life. I’m beyond terrified at the idea that this optimism, which I have internally as such a key part of my identity, might no longer exist. I also worry that the writing will become darker, and therefore ruin the style that I’ve worked towards.</p>
<p>Part of me knows that the book is, to put it mildly, unique in the writing style. I’ve continued to read about writing style and how to structure prose, and I think that there’s the internal argument within me<a href="#fn0442" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref42"><sup>42</sup></a> between adapting my writing style, and therefore the book, into something more mainstream, the part of me that wants to lean into the uniqueness, and the part of me that wants to not think about the style as I write. Writing that sentence, I know that it’s the exact same issue I have always had with poetry and music.</p>
<p>More than that, though, it’s the same argument that so many pop-adjacent<a href="#fn0443" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref43"><sup>43</sup></a> musicians use for not learning theory. They have a unique sound and don’t want to force themselves into the box that learning theory will do. I always decry this argument as nonsense, because learning new tools is never a bad thing.</p>
<p>However, there is absolutely something to be said about the rubik’s cube dilemma.<a href="#fn0444" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref44"><sup>44</sup></a> That is, once you know how to solve a rubik’s cube, there’s no way to go back and try to derive how to solve it yourself. Or, rather, knowledge changes the way that we see the world.</p>
<p>I know this is true, and have commented on it a lot. There is even a name for this, the <a href="https://psychology.stackexchange.com/questions/3801/what-is-the-name-of-the-cognitive-bias-where-an-expert-overestimates-the-knowled">curse of knowledge</a>.<a href="#fn0445" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref45"><sup>45</sup></a> In music, I feel like I’ve never thought of it as a curse.</p>
<p>Because music is such a universal human behavior, there are countless thinkers<a href="#fn0446" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref46"><sup>46</sup></a> who have put forth their reasons for why the curse of knowledge doesn’t apply to songwriting. In short, the idea tends to be that we all listen to so much music, and our brains are so hard wired to find patterns, that we have internalized most musical rules. Education simply lets us make the choices conscious, rather than unconscious.<a href="#fn0447" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref47"><sup>47</sup></a> There’s also the secondary point that I don’t see a lot of people talk about, which is that most people, especially today, learned their instruments from some sort of system that derives on some level from the academy.<a href="#fn0448" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref48"><sup>48</sup></a> I guess that I’m growing a little less sure of the position that knowledge is not a curse when it comes to finding a voice.</p>
<p>There’s the related but completely independent argument that much creative expression is not solely about using our own voice, but also about sharing it with someone else. If the consumer does not take in what you are trying to convey, were you successful in expression? Even deeper, if the consumer doesn’t consume the product because it’s so off putting to them, were you successful at expressing yourself? In some regards, this ties to the question of why I am writing the web novel.</p>
<p>Is it something autotelic<a href="#fn0449" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref49"><sup>49</sup></a>? Is it, as I’ve mentioned before, a way for me to practice and hone my writing skills? Is it, as I’ve thought about before, something I do with hopes of one day turning a profit? Is it about demonstrating that I can do whatever I set myself to, believing that I am unlimited?<a href="#fn0450" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Is it, as the initial drafts were, about writing something for my older sibling to read? From a friend, is it something that I do because it’s pleasurable?</p>
<p>This feels like a good place to stop the reflection for now, return to work<a href="#fn0451" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref51"><sup>51</sup></a>, and come back to this later.</p>

<h1 id="planning-for-lent"><a href="planning-lent-2025.html">Planning For Lent</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2025 March 1</p>
<p><br />
ection<span>Draft 1: 1 March 2025</span> As far as I can tell, I don’t have any musings on Lent.<a href="#fn051" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Lent comes from the Old English word for spring, which I really appreciate, since so few liturgical words seem to come from English’s roots. Every year I do something different for Lent, based on what I’ve done previous years and where I feel the most spiritual need for growth.</p>
<p>The Church’s default three things to focus on in Lent are: prayer, fasting, and almsgiving. I’ve often seen this expressed as giving something up, taking something on, and doing charity. These two triads are not identical, but they share some similarities.</p>
<p>A quick google search has any number of ideas for how to make Lent more meaningful. One of the sites has the very crucial piece of advice: the thing we give up for Lent shouldn’t be inherently sinful, because we shouldn’t be doing that in the first place. It’s totally fine and good to give something up for Lent with the expressed purpose of returning to it after Lent. That’s something I should keep in mind. Normally I tend to treat Lent as a test run for things which might be healthier for me long term. I’m going to give myself the freedom to also consider giving up or taking on things that I am pretty sure aren’t going to serve me as a new practice.</p>
<p>In the past, I have tended to give up meat and alcohol, both because those are traditional Lenten things<a href="#fn052" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and because they’re parts of my diet that are nice but not necessarily essential. This year, however, I’m really trying to find a way to keep my body nourished, and so I think that anything that puts a block between me and food is probably not a healthy idea<a href="#fn053" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In the past I’ve also added on large prayer plans, but that doesn’t feel as good right now, probably because of how little prayer I have right now. Still, I should add more prayer, both because it’s a thing explicitly recommended in Lent, and also because it’s a goal I’ve had external to that. I think that a decade of a rosary is absolutely a low bar, and something that is at least somewhat meditative, if I do it right. Chaplet of<a href="#fn054" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref4"><sup>4</sup></a> St. Michael is another good one, and I do find the intercessory prayers more powerful in that one, so I might say that as the thing.</p>
<p>Ok so then we have almsgiving. There are just so many places in the world right now that need help, and there are so many ways that I can give time, talent, and treasure<a href="#fn055" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref5"><sup>5</sup></a>. What causes are the nearest and dearest to me?</p>
<p>Honestly, I think that because so much of the focus of catholics around me is entirely on abortion, I find myself more and more looking at the ways that life is hard for mothers. There’s the cheap answer of trying to campaign for maternity leave or better protections for mothers, but that’s basically the same as doing nothing. There’s a charity in town that gives away diapers and other supplies families might need, and that’s probably a safe and good plan. It’s controversial for having formerly<a href="#fn056" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref6"><sup>6</sup></a> been a crisis pregnancy center, and I understand some of the objections that many have to them. However, they are the major provider of aid for new mothers in the area, as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>I have a friend who volunteers at a house for young<a href="#fn057" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref7"><sup>7</sup></a> single mothers. It is also an organization that could always use more resources. For reasons which seem fair, they’re less keen on having men volunteer, but I don’t have to put all my eggs in a single basket. It is important to both give low level aid to many and high level aid to a few. Which is better is ultimately a meaningless question, because we are constantly reminded that anyone we see struggling is Christ.</p>
<p>There’s also the more classic version of almsgiving, and the area certainly doesn’t lack homeless people. One thing that I’ve seen suggested in the past is giving away as much money to others as I spend on myself. Since part of Lent is about giving up pleasures, the fact that it might lead me to spend less on myself is a benefit, as is the reminder of just how many blessings my life is filled with.<a href="#fn058" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>It’s hard for me to feel like giving someone money is not an effective form of charity, even if I understand economies of scale are sometimes helpful, especially for food banks and the like. However, charity is a virtue like all others, and it needs to grow from somewhere. I think that it makes most sense for me to send money to one of the two organizations for mothers and infants, in part because that was something dear to my own mother’s heart. I’ll also think more about volunteering, though I do truthfully feel like I don’t have the time for it right now<a href="#fn059" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref9"><sup>9</sup></a> between everything else that I do.</p>
<p>So we’ve taken on prayer: the chaplet of St. Michael and alms giving: donating at least as much as I spend on myself per week to one of the above organizations as well as giving to the homeless on the street. What am I giving up?</p>
<p>First: games. I spend a lot of time passively wasting on playing logic puzzles, and I don’t think that’s particularly healthy for me. I’ll still play with friends or any non-digital game as it comes up, but solo games are out for the season. Should I give something else up?</p>
<p>I want to stop scrolling social media, so will try once again to stop scrolling. My friends value memes, it’s true, but they value me more than the memes I give them.<a href="#fn0510" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>I think that limited social media and no more games are probably two good things to give up. As I said, giving up meat doesn’t seem like my best bet right now. All said, this seems reasonable to me!</p>
<p>N.B. I’ve decided to have the whole list of goals that I have for the month at the bottom of each posting, and I’ll delete entries as is relevant. That way I can track everything each day!</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Professional:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Thesis Work:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Detailed outline (chapters and section titles at the very minimum) by 18 March. Finished that last night! Can remove.</p></li>
<li><p>Meet with Committee to decide a timeline. Before that, come up with my own idea for one.  Have a timeline of my own, the committee meeting is scheduled, so can remove.</p></li>
<li><p>Work on the research within the thesis!</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Be a better mentor: figure out how to take time to help underclassmen as they need help while still getting my own work done.</p></li>
<li><p>Leave work at work. I’ve been only really thinking about my research this past month, and I can feel it wearing me down rapidly. I’ve started setting some boundaries, so we’ll see if any of them happen</p></li>
<li><p>Work towards future career:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Read the recommended readings about science communication</p></li>
<li><p>Do the reflections that were recommended to me (mostly focused around why I care about science communication)</p></li>
<li><p>Work on the materials for the science outreach event in April: the handout while they work and a page for the families to take home</p></li>
<li><p>Figure out the difference between my public-facing and field-facing presentation affects. As I focus on becoming a better presenter, I need to become aware of the difference and how to switch them</p></li>
<li><p>I was reminded today that part of getting a job in the future requires, shockingly, searching and applying for them, so should start working on that as well</p></li>

<h1 id="reflection-on-the-start-to-the-year"><a href="reflection-february-2025html">Reflection on the Start to the Year</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2025 February 28</p>
<h1 id="draft-2-28-february">Draft 2: 28 February</h1>
<p>As the second month of the year comes to a close, I was reminded by a dear friend that it has been a while since last I updated my blog. The first draft of this post contains more ramblings and ideas, but my ideal blog post<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> is much tighter and cleaner.<a href="#fn062" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Where my writing, like my mind, is meant to ramble, I prefer to have asides in the footnotes. With that in mind<a href="#fn063" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, let’s reflect and, like all interactions, plot towards the future.<a href="#fn064" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Since the year began, I’ve managed to make progress on a fair number of my goals for the year, and possibly more importantly, I’ve also revised my goals for the year, incorporating both more time to think and the lived experiences that I have from attempting them. The only major difference is that I no longer have a goal relating to drawing or art of that kind. More than that, I now know that when I feel as though I should learn to draw, I simply have a short lull in my life, and some activity is soon to require my attention.</p>
<p>As we look towards the next month and period of the year<a href="#fn065" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref5"><sup>5</sup></a>, it seems worthwhile to explicitly state some goals, so that I can reflect on them. Given my inability to write those reflections without finding any number of sidebars<a href="#fn066" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref6"><sup>6</sup></a>, and given that they didn’t appear until at least a few thousand words in, let’s rewrite them. My goals can broadly be grouped into: Professional, Health, Other.<a href="#fn067" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Other is wrong, but I can’t find the word right now to describe the connecting thread for them that doesn’t also mean professional or health related goals.<a href="#fn068" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Professional:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Thesis Work:<a href="#fn069" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Detailed outline (chapters and section titles at the very minimum) by 18 March</p></li>
<li><p>Meet with Committee to decide a timeline. Before that, come up with my own idea for one.</p></li>
<li><p>Work on the research within the thesis!</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Be a better mentor: figure out how to take time to help underclassmen as they need help while still getting my own work done.</p></li>
<li><p>Leave work at work. I’ve been only really thinking about my research this past month, and I can feel it wearing me down rapidly.</p></li>
<li><p>Work towards future career:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Read the recommended readings about science communication</p></li>
<li><p>Do the reflections that were recommended to me (mostly focused around why I care about science communication)</p></li>
<li><p>Work on the materials for the science outreach event in April: the handout while they work and a page for the families to take home</p></li>
<li><p>Figure out the difference between my public-facing and field-facing presentation affects. As I focus on becoming a better presenter, I need to become aware of the difference and how to switch them</p></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Health:<a href="#fn0610" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<li><p>Start to separate the non-work time from work time. I think that, at the very least, I need to say that I will not do work in my apartment. Given that I generally avoid spending much time in there, these two goals should work together.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t waste time, and in particular, be mindful about making sure to take breaks and rest.</p></li>
<li><p>Clean sight lines. Is my space set up in a way that orients me towards my goals for the space? If not, how can I make it so?</p></li>

<li><p>Get back into writing letters.</p></li>
<li><p>Upon feeling a sense of dread at receiving a message from someone, remember that my lived experience says that most interactions are positive. More to the point, if my friends didn’t like me, they would tell me or at the very least would not continue to keep me in their life. If alone, speak something to that effect.</p></li>
<li><p>Compile a list of people who are important to me. It does not need to be comprehensive, but ideally would approach that.</p></li>

<li><p>Spend time making efforts to improve as a musician, not simply passively growing.</p></li>

<li><p>Why I care about science and communicating it</p></li>
<li><p>the block between me and my web novel</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Well, when spelled out, that’s both a lot and not many goals at all!</p>
<p>I think that it’s also probably smart for me to break the goals into one-offs and continuing goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Discrete Goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Thesis outline by March 18 for committee meeting.</p></li>
<li><p>Committee Meeting</p></li>
<li><p>Recommended readings about science communication</p></li>
<li><p>Make Lenten goals</p></li>
<li><p>Remove extraneous apps from phone.</p></li>

<li><p>Find a guitar project</p></li>
<li><p>Find web novel block</p></li>
<li><p>Materials for science expo</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Continuous Goals:<a href="#fn0616" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Thesis research</p></li>
<li><p>Writing my thesis</p></li>
<li><p>Being a better mentor</p></li>
<li><p>Separating work from not-work</p></li>
<li><p>Think about presentation affect</p></li>
<li><p>Pray better</p></li>
<li><p>Eat better</p></li>
<li><p>Write letters</p></li>
<li><p>Reach out to friends</p></li>
<li><p>quiet the voice in me that is nervous</p></li>
<li><p>grow as a musician (guitar, voice, general)</p></li>
<li><p>Write poetry</p></li>
<li><p>Write blogs</p></li>
<li><p>Daily goals/to dos<a href="#fn0617" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Clean home (std meaning)</p></li>
<li><p>Improve aesthetics of spaces</p></li>
<li><p>Be mindful of my time</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Despite how long this list appears, it’s really a very discrete number of things. More importantly, most all of the continuous goals are me attempting to orient myself. That is, rather than trying to get to writing daily poetry, I just want daily poetry to be on my mind going forward. Well, more than 6000 words later, I think that I should call this reflection here.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-28-february">Draft 1: 28 February</h1>
<p>It’s officially the end of the second month of the year. It has been a little over a month since the last time I posted here, and that’s not great, especially given the goals that I’ve had. Let’s use this space<a href="#fn0618" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref18"><sup>18</sup></a> and look through what <a href="planning-2025.html">our goals were</a> for the year<a href="#fn0619" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref19"><sup>19</sup></a> and see how resonant they still are, along with how much I have made progress on them.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the things that I’m excited for this year.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I have a timeline of sorts for my Ph.D, and I’m meeting with my committee soon to see whether they agree with it.</p></li>
<li><p>I think that I’m continuing to grow in my relationships, so that’s really nice.</p></li>
<li><p>I think that there was a typo in the old document, which is kind of fun. I do feel like my faith has continued to be a little touch and go, but hopefully as days get longer and brighter, so too will my outlook.</p></li>
<li><p>I’ve been doing better about feeding myself, though I’m starting to let it slide again. Last weekend’s adventures of traveling to watch a close friend defend his thesis and then returning to help with a chaotic graduate recruiting weekend, while fun, were certainly not conducive to my schedule.</p></li>
<li><p>Finding a way to live with my grief remains a weird thing. I certainly feel like I’m dealing with it better than I was in early January, and like with any pain I have, I find myself compulsively touching it. It’s so weird to realize that I can no longer and never again just text my mom a dumb question that I’ve forgotten the answer to and don’t feel like looking up. When something goes wrong in my life, I can no longer go to her for guidance or comfort. No longer will I hear her tell stories of her childhood and early adulthood.</p>
<p>Despite all that, the pain continues to be duller when I think on these things. I am slowly coming to terms with the reality, much as it really hurts to do so.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Moving on to my January goals, which I’m also going to treat as February goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I don’t think that I’ve done a single piece of album work or touched my accordion since writing that post. Music has been really hard for me lately, both because it’s always an emotional experience and I’ve been trying to repress my emotions and because I can’t separate my memories of sharing music with my mother from any music that I do. Still, this past week or two, I have been playing “I walk the Line” most mornings, so that’s at least some progress back in the direcion of making music.</p></li>
<li><p>I finished the embroidery project! That’s really exciting and great.</p></li>
<li><p>Working on art is something that I very quickly gave up on. Much as I love art, I more and more realize that it is so far down my list of priorities.</p></li>
<li><p>I stopped stretching in the morning and evening, because I’ve started going to yoga<a href="#fn0620" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref20"><sup>20</sup></a>. This week in particular, though, I’ve been exhausted and trying to recover from that<a href="#fn0621" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref21"><sup>21</sup></a>. It’s been really nice to spend 45 minutes in the morning and/or evening working on my flexibility and breath, and while I still absolutely cannot do the movements as naturally as the instructors, I can even more definitely say that I’m getting more flexible.</p></li>
<li><p>I think that I did a personal posting about my food needs? I don’t really remember when the series of posts was, but if it was after January 5, then I guess that I did that! Yay, a goal I finished.</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote four or so letters in four weeks, and then fell off of it. I had set it as a thing I did on the way home from choir, and choir stopped happening for a little bit, so I guess the writing did too. I should really get back into it.</p></li>
<li><p>Journal in the morning. I’ve stopped doing this, along with basically all journalling. I don’t know why, except that I’ve been feeling really driven in my work and nothing else lately. How much of that is repression, how much of that is a genuine drive, and how much is a fear of falling behind, I don’t know.</p></li>
<li><p>I stopped writing poetry, and that’s a shame. I think that I’m going to try to get back into that. I’ve been spending some time most nights crocheting while catching up on my soaps<a href="#fn0622" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref22"><sup>22</sup></a>, and finishing the night off with a little writing would probably serve me well.</p></li>
<li><p>I haven’t been able to touch my webnovel at all. I looked at the comments on the post where I said that I would be taking a hiatus, and the support there was really great. Even thinking about the novel this little bit has made my breath catch<a href="#fn0623" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref23"><sup>23</sup></a>, and that’s something I need to figure out how to work through, because I do think that I still want to finish it? As I typed that, I realized that it wasn’t necessarily true, hence the question mark. That’s something I can and probably should spend some time considering tomorrow.</p></li>
<li><p>Clearly I haven’t been blogging daily. I have written a few posts that I didn’t post though, because they went in directions I didn’t really want to share with the broader world. Still, it’s also good for me to remember how to sanitize my thoughts for broader distribution, especially as we start to head into public talk season.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, with my yearly goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I have made basically no progress on the thesis, though I have done some vague writing on the work I’m doing, which will hopefully make the thesis writing process easier. Still, that’s something I should spend some time on, and that might be a good thing to do while calculations run. At the very least, I want to spend some time making an outline of a thesis.</p></li>
<li><p>Coming to terms with my grief is, in fact, something that I’m doing as best a job on as I think that I can! Woo, finally something else I can unreservedly say that I’ve done well on so far.</p></li>
<li><p>Still working on the sustainability, but I think that there’s significant progress for sure. I’m right now struggling with the fact that I don’t know what I like eating, and my “fifteenth century girl dinner” of a roll, some hard cheese, apples, carrots, and some meat isn’t feeling great any more. I think that a large part of that is as simple as my body’s cues being different right now, and so I need to really figure out what my body needs, regardless of what I hear it saying.</p></li>
<li><p>Not writing the web novel has been very sustainable, unfortunately. I want that to stop being the case, though, which probably means that I would need to take a step back from my research. Given that my groupmates thought that I needed to go home at 2pm yesterday because I seemed completely burnt out, that might be a good idea on its own merits.</p></li>
<li><p>Wasting time has been ebbing and flowing. Generally, I find myself mindlessly browsing the internet far less, and I tend to be doing something with my hands while I watch all the videos that I enjoy consuming. I’ve even started unsubscribing from a number of the content creators that I followed while I needed constant audio stimulation, and will probably continue to winnow down the list. Outside of that, though, I do find that I spend a fair amount of time letting time pass, even if that’s just taking up logic puzzles. With Lent upcoming that could be a great thing to focus on. Instead of spending time playing mindless games, spend time praying.</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote a few letters, but have kind of fallen off of it lately. I would like to get back into that, if only because I love my cage<a href="#fn0624" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref24"><sup>24</sup></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I fell off of journalling, and I don’t know if it really is something that I feel good about lately.<a href="#fn0625" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I thought that I wanted to learn to draw, but more and more I’m realizing I prefer other forms of artistic expression, mostly involving string and yarn. I’m not totally sure why that is, but I’m sure that there are reasons I can consider. Maybe it’s just as simple as the fact that crochet and embroidery<a href="#fn0626" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref26"><sup>26</sup></a> are both so repetitive that I can treat them as meditative in a way that drawing isn’t. The fact that I know far fewer people markedly better at yarn craft than me compared to drawing certainly doesn’t hurt either.</p></li>
<li><p>Finishing the album is something that I’ve made literally no progress on lately. That’s probably ok, though, given how little time I’ve felt like I have had in general lately. I’ve been able to shift my sleep schedule earlier and earlier, which is actually really nice. I love waking up before 6 because my body is rested.<a href="#fn0627" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I joined a new choir,<a href="#fn0628" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref28"><sup>28</sup></a> and I did immediately start writing a piece for it, only to immediately lose energy.</p></li>
<li><p>I’ve been crocheting a lot lately, because I learned that making the flower part of a rose<a href="#fn0629" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref29"><sup>29</sup></a> takes between ten and twenty minutes depending on how well my hands are moving. That’s like the perfect amount of time, and it means that I don’t feel bad if I have to restart, in addition to making it far less likely that I do need to restart.</p></li>
<li><p>I feel like I have dropped accordion from my list of instruments, but am getting more proficiency for sure in guitar. I find myself picking differently to get genre-specific effects, and I can do scales far faster now, for all that I rarely use them. Singing has also been fun. The new choir expects me to sing a G4, so I’ve been once again forced to rely on my head voice/falsetto, and especially the transition between the two. It’s a skill I had developed really well during my time as an undergraduate, where I sang tenor in the early music choir, so it’s been fun to start to get it back. Yesterday, the church choir I sang in moved me down to bass 2, which is only notable because one of our songs this coming Sunday requires a D2. Even though I really struggle with E2 and F2, D2 comes out really well. I think that I’m probably just actively using subharmonics there, but who can say for certain?<a href="#fn0630" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref30"><sup>30</sup></a>.</p>
<p>More than anything, though, all the singing in different styles I’m doing is forcing me to once again remember the way that I have to set my entire vocal structure in order to have different ranges feel singable. I tend to reset on a breath, which makes sense to me, even if I do also wonder if it might be better for me to start trying to be able to do the changes more on the fly.</p></li>
<li><p>My life is absolutely cleaner! My home, while still a mess, is miles better than it has been, and I just find that I’m more and more able to keep my home relatively clean. That is, progress is well ongoing, even though I recognize I have a ways to go.</p></li>
<li><p>Despite it being two of my goals<a href="#fn0631" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref31"><sup>31</sup></a>, I will still not be working on art right now.</p></li>
<li><p>I should really start compiling my list of 26 for 26<a href="#fn0632" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref32"><sup>32</sup></a>. I feel like I’m making progress on it, but without tracking, it can be hard to know for certain.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So, two thousand words in<a href="#fn0633" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref33"><sup>33</sup></a>, what is the summary of my reflection?</p>
<p>I’m generally doing better than I thought I was on my goals, even if I’m doing far worse than the me of early January had hoped.</p>
<p>Before I answer “What do I want to work on in the month of March?”, let’s get some highlights of the past two months out of the way, because focusing on the good is better when framing my future.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Got my talk accepted for a conference!</p></li>
<li><p>Learned how to crochet roses, and got a ton of compliments on them.</p></li>
<li><p>Visited a friend to watch their dance recital<a href="#fn0634" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref34"><sup>34</sup></a> and gift them a hat<a href="#fn0635" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Had a wild interaction with a woman in a club, where she told me that she was dying of cancer and scared for her kids, and I was able to give advice as to what was helpful for me on the other end of the process.</p></li>
<li><p>Started some new medications, which have been really helpful</p></li>
<li><p>Found out what kind of group fitness classes I enjoy</p></li>
<li><p>Helped out with the science bowl again!</p></li>
<li><p>Taught the kids I teach how to binary search<a href="#fn0636" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Read a book that’s been on my TBR since just about as long as I’ve had one<a href="#fn0637" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Learned how to use the high throughput computing cluster at my school, and started using it.</p></li>
<li><p>Baked a lot of bread!</p></li>
<li><p>Made a pork shoulder that was absolutely delicious. Half of it fed me for weeks.</p></li>
<li><p>Went to a close friend’s thesis defense, and was in the acknowledgements!!! That’s quite possibly the first time I’ve been actually cited as a scientific source</p></li>
<li><p>Found out that the research I did in undergrad is not publishable<a href="#fn0638" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Helped out at a recruiting weekend and ended up being looked to to put out a number of<a href="#fn0639" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref39"><sup>39</sup></a> fires.</p></li>
<li><p>Met with my advisor and got a vague timeline for finishing my degree</p></li>
<li><p>Started watching a show weekly with a group of friends</p></li>
<li><p>Started leading my subgroup in weekly meetings and in general</p></li>
<li><p>Met with quite possibly the world’s best chemistry outreach<a href="#fn0640" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref40"><sup>40</sup></a> person and got advice about structuring a talk and really just conversation in general.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Wow, that’s way more than I thought, and I had to go back multiple times to add more and more to the list. Honestly, I feel way better about a lot now that I have that all down there. It is wild to me how much just sitting and reflecting does to make me feel centered, and I do absolutely need to make more of a point of doing so.</p>
<p>Looking into March, what’s on the docket?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Progress on thesis. At the very least, I want to have a detailed outline, where I have the chapters I’m going to write and the major sections within them as titles. Since I’m meeting with my committee in mid March, I should aim to do that sooner than later<a href="#fn0641" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Work on the food situation. With Lent coming up, I usually give up alcohol and meat. I don’t know if I’m going to give up either or both this year, but regardless, I want to focus on food which is more contemplative than mindless, and really make an effort to focus on eating food which is less ultraprocessed.<a href="#fn0642" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref42"><sup>42</sup></a> That is, I want to make sure that I’m feeding myself simply and healthily<a href="#fn0643" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref43"><sup>43</sup></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Figure out what the block is on my web novel. I don’t need to get back into it, but if I realize that it’s not going to come back, then I should accept that. If it is going to be something I pick back up, then I need to figure out what’s stopping me.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t waste time. I think that I’m going to give up playing games for lent<a href="#fn0644" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref44"><sup>44</sup></a>, though I should really reflect on my plans for lent before it starts. I also think that not wasting time can be thought of as not scrolling by social media, and so much more. I know that rest is vital, and so not a waste, but there are ways to rest that are not as brain rotting<a href="#fn0645" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref45"><sup>45</sup></a> as social media. I want to focus on those.</p></li>
<li><p>Writing. I want to, in addition to the thesis and novel, get back into blogging, poetry, and letter writing. The letters I’ve been sending have been really heavy, but letters don’t need to be so. Maybe read an old etiquette<a href="#fn0646" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref46"><sup>46</sup></a> guide on letters to see what used to be normative to include. The letter itself is probably the important part, not the depth of the contents.<a href="#fn0647" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Be better about group fitness classes. Twice a day during the work week is likely too many, but twice per week is definitely too few. As much as I have been enjoying the productivity of morning work, it does leave me crashing by early afternoon, so going to the morning yoga is likely a good option.</p></li>
<li><p>Be better about taking chances on interpersonal relationships. I have a deep seated and frankly irrational fear that many people in my life despise me. The best way to get that part of me to reduce is by forcing it to confront reality. Also, rejection rarely hurts as much as it feels like it will, especially if I don’t irrationally psych myself in any direction.</p></li>
<li><p>Music. I want to make efforts to grow in guitar and voice, not simply passively have them. I also want to get back into listening to music, and think that spending time reflecting on albums could be a good way to do that.</p></li>
<li><p>Continue to clean my life. I want the spaces to be cleaner, but I also want the content to be less cluttered. I do best when I know what’s coming and feel prepared<a href="#fn0648" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref48"><sup>48</sup></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Work on 26 for 26. At the very least, figure out how behind I am.</p></li>
<li><p>Healthy work life balance. I need to not spend every waking moment thinking about work, and I also need to be available as the senior member of my research group when younger students need my help.</p></li>
<li><p>Taking the advice about science communication, revise last year’s outreach talks and prepare for the weekend talk I have coming up.</p></li>
<li><p>Spend a little time each morning either virtually or physically thinking about goals for the day. I don’t know if looking at the goals again at night really helps that much, but if it’s something I have the space to do<a href="#fn0649" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref49"><sup>49</sup></a>, then I might as well try that too.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This set of goals is markedly different than the one at year beginning, and I feel comfortable with the changes. Mostly, they come from me realizing that my priorities are starting to focus on excelling in the areas I care about, rather than trying to become competent at even more areas that I have no true need for.<a href="#fn0650" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>In a slightly more coherent manner, the goals I have for March:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Professional:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Get a working outline of my thesis before committee meeting</p></li>
<li><p>Work on leaving work at work</p></li>
<li><p>Work on being a better mentor</p></li>
<li><p>Work on science communication:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Draft the materials for the science exploration I’m helping to lead</p></li>
<li><p>Read the recommended readings from the meeting and look to how I can incorporate that into the materials I already have</p></li>
<li><p>figure out how to separate my public facing presentation from intra-field communication. The talks need to be different, and I want to make sure I have the affects in my head.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Heath:<a href="#fn0651" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Physical:<a href="#fn0652" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Feed myself simply and healthily. I think that I should probably start tracking what I eat, at least vaguely, because right now I feel like I don’t feed myself enough, and the fact that my weight is stable means that the calories in and out are equaling each other, and I know that I’m not getting great calories in. I am in a healthy enough mind space right now that I don’t have to settle for simply making sure that I have any fuel, I can work on bettering the fuel.<a href="#fn0653" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref53"><sup>53</sup></a> I know that nutrition is aided by cooking, so figure out what foods I need to cook in order to efficiently extract the nutrition, or other options<a href="#fn0654" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref54"><sup>54</sup></a><a href="#fn0655" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Go to Group Fitness more regularly</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Mental:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Spend time each day thinking about what I want to have happen in the course of the day.</p></li>
<li><p>Work to keep professional and personal things separate<a href="#fn0656" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Don’t waste time, and in particular, be mindful about making sure to take breaks and rest.</p></li>
<li><p>Clean my spaces:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Normal Physical things (kitchen, bathroom, messes on tables)</p></li>
<li><p>Sight lines: are the visuals I have at any given point the ones that I want? Are spaces set up to be conducive to what I want?</p></li>
<li><p>Start reading and returning books<a href="#fn0657" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Honestly, I think that the first two points, if not all three belong in here<a href="#fn0658" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Be more intentional about reaching out to others:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Both figure out what to put in a normal letter and get back into writing them</p></li>
<li><p>When I feel the sudden gut wrenching fear of an unexpected message, stop and verbally<a href="#fn0659" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref59"><sup>59</sup></a> remind myself that I have<a href="#fn0660" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref60"><sup>60</sup></a> good and honest friends who value our relationship like I do,<a href="#fn0661" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref61"><sup>61</sup></a> and much as I like randomly reaching out, some of them do as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Once again compile a list of people who are important to me, and work to start figuring out times and ways to connect with them<a href="#fn0662" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref62"><sup>62</sup></a><a href="#fn0663" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I think those three are good! Maybe start giving small gifts, but that’s something I can do.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Spiritual:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Be more intentional about prayer</p></li>
<li><p>Figure out what I want to do with my lent, and start doing that.<a href="#fn0664" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Artistic:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Work on guitar and voice, not just passively.</p></li>
<li><p>I guess the rest of writing belongs here</p></li>
<li><p>Writing:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Find the web novel mental block</p></li>
<li><p>Start writing poetry again</p></li>
<li><p>Start blogging (and also posting the blogs more)</p></li>
<li><p>26 for 26? This should maybe go somewhere else? idk. Artistic might be the wrong goal. Maybe just “other”</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Woo! We did it! Only 4500 words to vaguely get my point across. Let’s revise this so that i can make it a little easier to follow</p>

<li id="fn0633"><p>hey cool, my writing pace is still around 2k an hour, which is right around 30 a minute.

<li id="fn0634"><p>they were, unsurprisingly, fantastic<a href="#fn06ref34" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn0636"><p>no, that was not connected to the theology in any way, shape, or form<a href="#fn06ref36" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0637"><p>and, wildly, it was really great. One review put it nicely “it shouldn’t have been as enjoyable as it was”, since it did really have a pretty predictable and generic plot, caricatures of characters (ooh that’s a great line, I need to do something with that in the future), and the outdated sexual morals of the 1970s (consent is much different now)<a href="#fn06ref37" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn0643"><p>ah yeah simple is probably what I meant<a href="#fn06ref43" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0644"><p>in the sense of video games to pass the time, not in the sense of any shared experience with people<a href="#fn06ref44" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn0647"><p>that feels wrong to say, but I am in general struggling to find the words to express myself. That’s part of why I want to get back into journaling and poetry<a href="#fn06ref47" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0648"><p>once again the wrong word, but like I feel better when I have a journal with me, regardless of my intention to write<a href="#fn06ref48" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn0650"><p>Drawing is really the big one here. I don’t care about it when I don’t have time, and when I do have time, I do. That’s interesting enough, and is probably something I can keep in mind as I move forward in life.

<li id="fn0652"><p>yes, I realize that I am not a mind, body, and soul as three distinct parts, but it does help me to think of the driving reason behind each. Secondary effects are not primary<a href="#fn06ref52" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0653"><p>there’s a post that I’ve seen that means a lot to me talking about how there’s no bad calories, and also that potatoes are not great in spite of caloric density, but in part because of it<a href="#fn06ref53" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn0660"><p>probably, though that’s something I shouldn’t say there. Hmm what is something that I can say that feels true and is helpful (this was initially going to be followed by wronged, but the new one is better)<a href="#fn06ref60" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>

<h1 id="musing-on-getting-back-in-shape"><a href="back-in-shape.html">Musing on Getting Back in Shape</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 22 January 2025</p>
<h1 id="draft-one">Draft One</h1>
<p>I know that somewhere I’ve mused before about my fitness goals. Though they’ve changed over the years, I think that they’ve remained relatively static since college, or at least in the past few years. These days, my goals are primarily to gain flexibility and endurance.</p>
<p>In college, I would often joke about the fact that I had steadily gone from sprinting sport to more sprinting of a sport. Football, despite being nominally only a few seconds per play, ends up generally being a few minutes of sprinting back and forth until possession changes. As a person whose only real event in swimming was the fifty freestyle, those few minutes became twenty to thirty seconds<a href="#fn071" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Then, in college, I transitioned to diving, where each three second burst of effort in a meet was surrounded by at least five to ten minutes of rest.</p>
<p>Through all of this, I was relatively strong. Even today, I’m fairly sure that I can, at least once, lift more than most of the people I know. There’s something to be said for focusing on strengths, but I don’t think that applies here.</p>
<p>For one, I have always preferred being a jack of all trades to a master of one. For the other, given that I’m already stronger than average, the number of situations where I’ll need to lift something beyond my current limits but within my theoretical limits is relatively small. By contrast, the number of times that I’ll want to rush somewhere without losing my breath, or be able to contort my body to get somewhere<a href="#fn072" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> is far higher. With that in mind, while working through the group fitness offerings, I prioritized cardio fitness and flexibility over strength.<a href="#fn073" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Today, I tried my first barre class.</p>
<p>In retrospect, I’m not entirely sure what I expected. If I force myself to come to a conclusion about what I thought we’d be doing, it was something like plies and other such movements on the barre<a href="#fn074" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref4"><sup>4</sup></a>. Instead, it was, as the instructor said, a mix of plyometrics, calisthenics, and ballet. We did do a little bit on the barre, but mostly we used it for balance.<a href="#fn075" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>I struggled with the workout a lot. I hadn’t realized quite how out of shape I am, but that was a great reminder. Somewhat surprisingly, to me at least, the fact that it was so painful and hard for me motivated me to go more regularly. I rely on my body for so much, so seeing that I’m letting it down in general is not something that I take lightly.</p>
<p>I still didn’t make it to yoga today, but I have hopes for tomorrow. Otherwise, I think that I was in general decent at following the flowchart. I’m not sure how much of it is a thing that I need to do in order and how much is just a “yes, this is a list of activities I need to ensure that I do at some point.” Still, I think that I’m doing better for having the organization, even if it is far from optimal. After all, the only way to improve is to start. Wherever I am right now is where I am. The only way to get closer to my goal is day by day.</p>

<h1 id="an-initial-attempt-to-make-macro-bread"><a href="recipe-protein-bread-1.html">An Initial Attempt to Make Macro Bread</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 21 January 2025</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As I’ve mentioned in the last few posts, I’m trying to organize my life under a few different principles. Notably, I wanted to make sure that, even though the USDA seems less than clear about their need, I get enough phytonutrients of each kind. When I looked through my diet and what I could easily add to my diet<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, I was missing aliums and purple fruit. With that in mind, I decided to try to make a bread that incorporated them.</p>
<p>At the store, dried figs and daikon<a href="#fn082" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> were the mixins that spoke to me most. Below is the recipe I vaguely followed, along with a quick back of the envelope calculation for macronutrients.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Add approximately 500 grams of flour<a href="#fn083" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and 650 grams of water<a href="#fn084" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref4"><sup>4</sup></a> to a bowl, mix until a thick paste is formed, and add in about a tablespoon of yeast.</p></li>
<li><p>Upon being allowed to rise<a href="#fn085" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref5"><sup>5</sup></a>, shred approximately 250 grams of daikon<a href="#fn086" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref6"><sup>6</sup></a> and squeeze to remove moisture.</p></li>
<li><p>Finely chop 250 grams of fig, and also add to the dough<a href="#fn087" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref7"><sup>7</sup></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Also add 100 grams of rye flour, 100 grams of almond flour<a href="#fn088" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref8"><sup>8</sup></a>, 25 grams of vital wheat gluten, 250 grams of greek yogurt to the mixture and begin to knead. I ultimately needed to add another 300 grams of flour<a href="#fn089" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref9"><sup>9</sup></a> and 10 grams of gluten to get the dough to be the appropriate level of sticky, which is to say not at all. I also added salt somewhere in there, but that was eyeballed at best.</p></li>
<li><p>I oiled the ball and let double, then divided into twelve even balls of approximately 200 grams.</p></li>
<li><p>I forgot about them overnight and so found them to be overproofed, so reshaped, heated oven to 350 for 30 minutes as they reproofed, and baked at 350 for 30 minutes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>How did they turn out? Honestly pretty well. I’m happy with the taste, if only because the fig comes through, but the daikon doesn’t at all. I didn’t love how sulfurous the daikon smelled while shredding or baking, though, and so might have to take steps to prevent that in the future. Chief among these, I think that I’ll try shredding into cold water that’s been doped<a href="#fn0810" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref10"><sup>10</sup></a> with either salt or baking soda, since those seem to work for others. Other than that, I might add more of either the daikon or fig, since they’re shockingly under noticed, for being a full 45 percent of the mass of the dough.<a href="#fn0811" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>What else went wrong? I don’t love the texture. I’m not sure if that’s due to the relatively low flour to other ratio, the overproofing, or something to do with using whole wheat flour. Regardless, I will probably try the next batch without rye, since I didn’t notice much by way of flavor from it, and it definitely does a lot to add that kind of texture. I’ll also try not to let the dough overproof, but that’s far more optimistic.</p>
<p>Nutrition Information as Eyeballed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>840 g<a href="#fn0812" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref12"><sup>12</sup></a> of whole wheat flour. Its bag says 100 calories, 4 grams of protein, 20 grams carbs, 3 grams fiber, and 0.5 grams fat per 28 grams.<a href="#fn0813" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Somehow, that means I used exactly 30 servings of flour, for a total of 3000 calories, 120 grams of protein, 600 grams of carbs, 90 grams of fiber, 15 grams of fat.</p></li>
<li><p>650 grams water, which is nutritionless</p></li>
<li><p>267 grams <a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/2709803/nutrients">daikon</a>, which is 16 calories, 0.68 grams of protein, 0.1 grams of fat, 3.4 grams of carbs, and 1.6 grams of fiber per 100 grams. That means a total of 43 calories, 1.8 grams of protein, .267 grams of fat, 9 grams of carbs, and 4.3 grams of fiber total.<a href="#fn0814" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>254 grams of fig, and that’s all I’m going to be putting in here because I don’t think anyone needs me to do the math.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In total:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>5150<a href="#fn0815" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref15"><sup>15</sup></a> calories</p></li>
<li><p>210<a href="#fn0816" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref16"><sup>16</sup></a> grams protein</p></li>
<li><p>85<a href="#fn0817" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref17"><sup>17</sup></a> grams fat</p></li>
<li><p>900<a href="#fn0818" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref18"><sup>18</sup></a> grams carbs</p></li>
<li><p>145<a href="#fn0819" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref19"><sup>19</sup></a> grams fiber</p></li>
</ul>
<p>which, assuming I split my rolls perfectly, comes out to about:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>430 calories</p></li>
<li><p>17.5 grams of protein</p></li>
<li><p>7 grams of fat</p></li>
<li><p>75 grams of carbs</p></li>
<li><p>12 grams of fiber</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In total, about 24 calories per gram of protein, well below the 40 threshold I need to average over the day. It is interesting how calorically empty daikon is, and how relatively dense fig is.</p>
<p>Daily reflection:</p>
<p>Didn’t do great about maintaining the schedule I set, but did do more than expected, all things considered.</p>

<h1 id="on-a-scheduled-life"><a href="scheduled-life.html">On a Scheduled Life</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 20 January 2025</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As I mused about <a href="planning-2025">at the start of the year</a>, I want to stop wasting time. The easiest way to do that, as I can see, is to see what I actually do with my time, and also to make sure that the things I want to do are on the list. I opened all the posts<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> that even vaguely referenced schedules as I prepared to write this post.</p>
<p>However, before that I made my actual schedule.</p>
<p>“How?” you might be asking, either as someone looking for insight into my mind or as someone who wants to organize their own life. It was certainly not the most time efficient method, though I think that it may have ended up as the optimal method for me.</p>
<p>First, I sat and intentionally did not have audio going. I know that may be obvious to many, but your brain cannot think as well or deeply or freely if you’re listening to an audiobook. From there, I started writing down my goals for the day, and that led quickly into the things that I generally want to do, and their regularity.</p>
<p>I traveled to a new location<a href="#fn092" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and took that messy document<a href="#fn093" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and compiled it into two pages: goals for the day and my general musings. The goal for the day was nominally in linear order, but the musings were not in the slightest. My general musings had me breaking my life into:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Things to do before work</p></li>
<li><p>Things to make sure to do every day at work</p></li>
<li><p>Things to do after work</p></li>
<li><p>Weekly commitments</p></li>
<li><p>some random musings on things I’d like to do soonish<a href="#fn094" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>a list of activities that I wanted to do along with an annotation for the frequency I wanted to do it and its importance to me, e.g.<a href="#fn095" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref5"><sup>5</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#fn096" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Serenade a pigeon 6.5. This means 3 times each week I wanted to serenade a pigeon, and its importance is 6.5/10.</p></li>
<li><p>Touch grass 9. This means daily I want to touch grass, 9/10 importance.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, I was not immediately able to annotate the importance of items without having the full list. More than that, though, I don’t love absolute measurement scales, and so I started with my first item, decided that it wasn’t very important, and assigned it a low score. The next item on the list seemed relatively more important, so I gave it a six. The next item was even more important, so I gave it a seven. Item 4 was in between items two and three for importance, so I gave it a 6.3, since I felt like it was closer in importance to item two than item one. I continued this through the entire list.</p>
<p>Now that I’m done with it, I do find it interesting that so many of my goals were in the 6 to 7 range and the 8 to 9 range, with nothing between 7 and 8, and only a single item below 6.<a href="#fn097" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Even if the exact values might change, it does show me that I have one goal I don’t care about<a href="#fn098" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref8"><sup>8</sup></a>, one goal I care about a lot<a href="#fn099" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref9"><sup>9</sup></a>, groups of goals that are very important to me<a href="#fn0910" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref10"><sup>10</sup></a>, and groups of goals that are moderately important to me.<a href="#fn0911" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref11"><sup>11</sup></a> I do keep some absolute scaling, I guess, because nothing was a 10<a href="#fn0912" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref12"><sup>12</sup></a>, and nothing was a sub-4<a href="#fn0913" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref13"><sup>13</sup></a>.</p>
<p>I then took my annotated pieces of<a href="#fn0914" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref14"><sup>14</sup></a> paper home and didn’t look at it until today. Before bed, however, I made a list of tasks that I wanted to accomplish today in my bedside journal.<a href="#fn0915" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Upon waking up and going through parts of my morning ritual<a href="#fn0916" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref16"><sup>16</sup></a>, I sat down with the two pieces of paper and the goals from yesterday’s journaling<a href="#fn0917" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref17"><sup>17</sup></a> and grabbed some more blank paper.</p>
<p>First, I wrote in large letters and a sectioned off block the nominally immovables in my schedule. That is, the things that happen at a set time. I say nominally because in that list was also when I work<a href="#fn0918" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref18"><sup>18</sup></a> and a few things that have rough end times. Below that I made a list of all the things that I had sorted yesterday, now ranked from most to least important. The new list looked something like:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Touch Grass [5M] [D] [NA]</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure Gravity exists [1H?] [W] [3W]</p></li>
</ul>
<p>That is:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Spend at least five minutes<a href="#fn0919" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref19"><sup>19</sup></a> touching grass each day<a href="#fn0920" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref20"><sup>20</sup></a>, with no upper limit on times to do so.</p></li>
<li><p>I think that it will take me around an hour<a href="#fn0921" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref21"><sup>21</sup></a> to make sure gravity exists, and I want to do it once a week, but if I had empty space in my schedule, I wouldn’t want it to happen more than three times a week.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>One of my big goals was making use of the fitness class access pass I bought for the semester. They break all activities into one of four categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cardio</p></li>
<li><p>HIIT</p></li>
<li><p>Strength</p></li>
<li><p>Mind Body</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I always want more cardio fitness, generally enjoy feeling stronger, and would love to be flexible and in touch with my body. As a result, I then went to the page where they listed each activity per category, e.g. for the made up category of “Fun”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Touching Grass</p></li>
<li><p>Singing Songs</p></li>
<li><p>Testing Gravity</p></li>
<li><p>Sleeping</p></li>
<li><p>Yoga</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I did my normal way of deciding between options, ranking each item in relation to the rest, and started ranking them on the page:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Singing Songs &gt; Touching Grass</p></li>
<li><p>Singing Songs &gt; Testing Gravity &gt; Touching Grass</p></li>
<li><p>Sleeping &gt;&gt; Singing Songs</p></li>
<li><p>Yoga <span class="math inline">≥</span> Sleeping</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Which means that<a href="#fn0922" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref22"><sup>22</sup></a> I think that I would probably enjoy yoga and sleeping the same amount, though if I had to choose I’d lean towards yoga. Sleeping is significantly preferable to singing songs. Singing songs beats out testing gravity, which beats out touching grass.</p>
<p>After going through each of the four categories, I made my overall ranking, which unsurprisingly was almost entirely less than or equal to signs.<a href="#fn0923" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>From there, I went down and listed every single option on the calendar that the school provides, because I prefer being able to look through hand written pages, because I don’t like their layout<a href="#fn0924" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref24"><sup>24</sup></a>, and because there were only a few activities that I cared about. I did make this new list still broken down into category, e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Fun (Only Yoga)<a href="#fn0925" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>715-8 M-F (runs from 7:15 to 8 AM any day of Monday through Friday)</p></li>
<li><p>715-815 TR<a href="#fn0926" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref26"><sup>26</sup></a> (runs from 7:15 to 8:15 AM on Tuesday or Thursday)</p></li>
<li><p>1300-1400 U<a href="#fn0927" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref27"><sup>27</sup></a> (runs from 1 to 2 pm on Sunday)</p></li>
<li><p>1500-1550 A<a href="#fn0928" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref28"><sup>28</sup></a> (runs 3 to 3:50 PM Saturdays)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Thinking (Where I kept both Biting and Crying)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>715-8 M-R B</p></li>
<li><p>730-9 F B</p></li>
<li><p>9-10 C</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Etc. etc.</p>
<p>On a new page, I looked back at the group fitness goals I had<a href="#fn0929" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref29"><sup>29</sup></a>. Of the four activities I compiled, I wanted to make sure to do three of them at least once a week. I then went through and tried to find a way to do that. Because of prior commitments, there was only a single time each week I could do a barre class<a href="#fn0930" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref30"><sup>30</sup></a>, a single time a week I could do Zumba, and a nice yoga spot every morning before I wanted to get to work, so below the listed set of workouts with prior constraints removed, I made a list of what I wanted to do each day and when.</p>
<p>From there, we moved on to the actual scheduling part of my time.<a href="#fn0931" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref31"><sup>31</sup></a> I started by listing the events that I wanted to do, starting with waking up. Using my time estimates, I was able to back track how early I would need to wake up in order to get each item I wanted to do before work done before going to yoga. Thankfully everything except for the 4 fit. It took some restructuring, because as I walked through the morning in my mind, I realized that I have a connection where some activities feels better to move into others. Like those logic puzzles where everything is given relative referents, I found a solution that worked, along with the quick time reminder of how long each would take.</p>
<p>Saturday and Sunday were the odd ones out, because neither has work, and so timing is weird. Since there’s another yoga slot later in the morning on Saturdays, I just moved the entire schedule so wakeup is at the same relative time to yoga. Sunday I set the wakeup time with the other five days of the week, but decided to go to it last.</p>
<p>Because my schedule diverges daily after yoga, I then went through my Monday through Friday schedule, noting the activities that I wanted to do before going home, with time stamps where relevant. On the next page, I started to plot out what I wanted to do each night, and what I also wanted to do differently each night. I also started plotting out ideas for Sunday. At this point, Monday through Friday is nominally scheduled from waking to sleeping<a href="#fn0932" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref32"><sup>32</sup></a>, and Saturday and Sunday are relatively empty. Looking at the ordered list of floating items, I was happy to se that most all of them were done, with only the weekly tasks yet to be assigned. I made a list of those items under the day I felt like they belonged, since floating items only need to be scheduled relative to the fixed items and each other if relevant.</p>
<p>I then made my weekly flowchart, which diverges and converges fairly often. Because routines are important, I tried my best to keep the divergent streams as similar to each other as possible. I also put literally everything I could think of as a necessary part of the schedule<a href="#fn0933" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref33"><sup>33</sup></a> as an example, because cognitive load is bad.</p>
<p>I opened another small journal and made nine lists:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Things to do every morning (so everything I do before the divergence, with wake time removed, because I know when that is)</p></li>
<li><p>Things to do every night</p></li>
<li><p>Monday tasks...</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, two hours after beginning, I was finished with my goal of plotting my ideal life. Most of it will be as simple as following a checklist, with the only<a href="#fn0934" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref34"><sup>34</sup></a> cognitive load coming at the beginning and end of each day, where I go over my short term goals, and at the beginning and end of each week, where I do the same with slightly longer term goals.<a href="#fn0935" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref35"><sup>35</sup></a> I’m hopeful that this will work and that it will make my life better.</p>
<p>Now to look at all the previous times I’ve tried and failed to see if there might be any common patterns:<a href="#fn0936" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>My <a href="goal-updates">goal updates from last December</a>, which made me realize that I was aiming for far too many tasks, and that a lot of them weren’t as important to me as they felt while sitting at a computer. That’s one reason I did the entire scheduling process by hand, because I know that I think better unplugged.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="how-im-keeping-track-of-my-time-abroad">an early musing</a>, where I mostly just reflected on the various ways that I tracked time passing by, which hasn’t really changed<a href="#fn0937" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="living-scheduled">about two years ago</a> I said that I found that having a list of items was really helpful. Looking at the calendar of blog posts, I was indeed going through a good period of, if nothing else, getting a blog out daily. Emotional things happened which threw me off my game. Of course that’s the risk of making any human connection, and I find it worthwhile to make connections despite that fact.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="planning-to-fail">this post from a month or so later</a> points out that, short of actively making time for something, I will often lose it.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="schedules">About two and a half years ago</a><a href="#fn0938" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref38"><sup>38</sup></a> I realized that making a list of people to contact with frequencies, or setting up regular reminders, at least, works really well. I fell off of it about two years from the post, which makes sense given what was going on in my life (see the aforementioned risks of connection).<a href="#fn0939" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="schedules-2">Naively</a>, I assumed that an autopopulated list on my phone would save me. I did not like looking at it, and it was far too repetitive<a href="#fn0940" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref40"><sup>40</sup></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>A few weeks <a href="schedules-3">later</a>, I spent a fair amount of time thinking about what’s important to me and how I can make time for it.<a href="#fn0941" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref41"><sup>41</sup></a> “I think that I have the space to be able to do so, at least for now” is the relevant quote, because I was again, too optimistic in what I wanted to do. Might be good to have some sacrificial items that I can comfortably say I’ll get rid of if I’m out of spoons.<a href="#fn0942" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Speaking of <a href="spoons-and-spell-slots">spoons</a>, running out of energy is a very real thing, and many of the activities I do when low energy do not replenish me.<a href="#fn0943" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>In what is a weird happenstance <a href="spoons-2">I wrote “About eighteen months ago”</a> about eighteen months ago. It contained the poignant quote “I find it interesting that I continually look at scheduling my life as a potential solution. Intellectually, it very well could be, but I have such an aversion to scheduling myself that I don’t know if it will be probable for me without changing something major about my life”<a href="#fn0944" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref44"><sup>44</sup></a>. It pointed out that rest, deadlines, and timers all help me, and, as the quote points out, I resist self scheduling.</p>
<p>As I mention there, the more tired I am, the more I am willing to call my own bluff and point out that any commitment to myself is only as binding as I want it to be. More than that, though, I’ve realized that I need activities to be scheduled immediately succeeding each other with no space for me to get lost. That is, if it only takes me twelve minutes to get home instead of the fifteen I scheduled, I cannot let myself go “ooh yay three free minutes to do whatever!”. Instead, I need to immediately move to my next task.</p>
<p>Being early to externally timed events, though, I’m ok with my tendency to disappear time.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s very possible that I missed some posts there, but I don’t really care that much. I think that the important pieces for me in particular to remember about my aversion to schedules are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Relative times are much better than absolute times. Or, don’t set timers for things, just have a list of what follows what.</p></li>
<li><p>Breaks are almost impossible for you to recover from. As the fact that you sat down for two hours and with complete focus wrote your schedule, before immediately spending the past 75 minutes writing this blog post without distractions points out, focused work for longer is better. Transitions are the killer.<a href="#fn0945" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>That might be an issue, because I do also want to get into the habit of moving each hour and drinking water often. I suppose that bathroom breaks tend not to count as a break in my mind, so as long as I’m hydrating to an hourly rate, that should work.</p></li>
<li><p>There are far more things that you want to do than you have time for.</p>
<p>I didn’t schedule any time for my web serial, though dropping yoga would free 6 hours a week, and Sunday should have enough free time to make for writing if I needed. I could also drop my nightly scheduled reading time, or shorten the morning silence time. I also allocated 45 minutes to blogging each night, which is almost never the time it actually takes me. Unfortunately, 5 and 90 do average out to about 45, and that does generally seem like a good amount of time for me to spend on a general post. Maybe the excess time can be put to use writing the book.</p></li>
<li><p>Time without stimuli is good and healthy and necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>The less mental<a href="#fn0946" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref46"><sup>46</sup></a> effort that a task takes, the easier it is to do.</p>
<p>No, that isn’t entirely right. “The easier it is to start a task, the easier it is” reads as far more accurate to me. As the struggle with transitions implies, starting a task is really difficult for me. The more that I can tell myself the task is automatic, the more likely I am to do it.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, you need to be doing well to be doing well. Almost every time that I’ve stopped this blog in the past<a href="#fn0947" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref47"><sup>47</sup></a> I’ve not been doing well. I don’t really know how to fix that, except to make sure to avoid running myself ragged.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All this being said, I do hope that I am able to maintain my life when the summer, with its constant interruptions to schedules, arrives.</p>
<p>Daily:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Practiced guitar? It is now on my morning list, but I have yet to do it today.</p></li>
<li><p>Twice daily stretching? In addition to everything else I did yesterday, I also made my stretch list.</p></li>
<li><p>Poetry? Need to get started with that again.</p></li>
<li><p>Blog? A behemoth!</p></li>
<li><p>Net cleaner home? I’m going to say yes, but I’m also going to spend some time right now fixing it. I do know that people say the more specific a task is the better, but I feel like right now there’s enough low hanging fruit for fixing things that I don’t really need to plan that much. I can’t wait for the time when that is no longer true and I once again find myself having to decide what to clean.<a href="#fn0948" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p></li>
