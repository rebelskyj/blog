<p>First Published: 17 January 2025 (because I forgot to hit post)</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-10-january-2025">Draft 1: 10 January 2025</h1>
<p><a href="dietary-needs-2">Yesterday</a> I went through some of the different ways that I could get sufficient protein.<a href="#fn001" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Since I’m<a href="#fn002" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> not going to just consume all of my protein from a single source, I do technically have an NP problem, which is a variant of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem">knapsack problem</a>. However, I’m looking for solutions that do not fit neatly into the normal computational framework, if only because more or less everything I could consume is functionally continuous, and the knapsack problem is meant for discrete entries.</p>
<p>Chicken, fish, and cheese are all similar in that I need to be eating about a pound a day of them in order to get my nutritional needs met. That’s a fair amount of volume, if nothing else. I can’t really imagine sitting down and eating a pound of any of them in a single sitting<a href="#fn003" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>However, one piece of advice a friend gave me was to speak to a dietician at my school, which is apparently free. Rather than continue to worry about all of this, I’m going to try to do that instead.</p>
<p>Daily:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Practiced guitar? Not yet today</p></li>
<li><p>Twice daily stretching? The five minutes at night seems so much harder than the one in the morning. Making an actual list of what I do for how long is almost certainly my best option going forward.</p></li>
<li><p>Poetry? I’ve generally been doing two or so stanzas, and usually working on a different ideal each time. Yesterday I was trying for an ABBA rhyme scheme.</p></li>

<h1 id="draft-2-9-january-2024">Draft 2: 9 January 2024</h1>
<p>My last draft really went off the rails, because I got too far into the biohacking mindset. At the base minimum, I should be consuming:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>90 grams of protein</p></li>
<li><p>130 grams of carbohydrates</p></li>
<li><p>17 grams of linoleic acid</p></li>
<li><p>1.6 grams of alpha-linoleic acid</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Below, we see that,<a href="#fn011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> at the absolute minimum, I can meet this in a smoothie that does this relatively easily. Since the fat and carbohydrates are incredibly simple to achieve, it’s worth considering what 90 grams of protein otherwise looks like. Common ways I get protein are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Rice</p></li>
<li><p>Pasta</p></li>
<li><p>Fish</p></li>
<li><p>Chicken</p></li>
<li><p>Gelatin</p></li>
<li><p>Beans</p></li>
<li><p>Eggs</p></li>
<li><p>Milk</p></li>
<li><p>Cheese</p></li>
<li><p>Yogurt</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To get 90 grams of protein from each of these sources, I would need to consume<a href="#fn012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref2"><sup>2</sup></a>:</p>
<ul>

<li><p><a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/2259793/nutrients">Yogurt</a>: 2.6 kilograms, about 22.3 cal/g</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the future, I’ll hopefully figure out a way to take these numbers and construct a meal plan out of them.</p>

<h1 id="draft-1-9-january-2024">Draft 1: 9 January 2024</h1>
<p>First, it appears that I was wrong in yesterday’s musing. The oil requirements are just straight up grams per day, which makes my life significantly easier. In order to hit my nutrition goals, I should be consuming at a minimum:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>90 grams of protein</p></li>
<li><p>130 grams of carbohydrates</p></li>
<li><p>17 grams of linoleic acid<a href="#fn0110" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>1.6 grams of alpha-linoleic acid<a href="#fn0111" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I generally see 1500 calories as the starvation threshold.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>That is very little, and in total seems to add up<a href="#fn0112" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref12"><sup>12</sup></a> to around 2300 calories. If I choose better oils for alpha linoleic acid<a href="#fn0113" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref13"><sup>13</sup></a>, that number drops to 1222 calories per day. If I price out my costs,<a href="#fn0114" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref14"><sup>14</sup></a> to hit the minimum I need for nutrition:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>about 144 grams, or 5 ounces of gelatin, which comes out to 6.56 dollars</p></li>
<li><p>1 tablespoon of corn oil is about 14 grams, and costs about 4.5 cents, which means daily need would be around 10 cents</p></li>
<li><p>Flaxseed oil is approximately as dense, one tablespoon costs 44 cents, and so the daily need is about 14 cents</p></li>
<li><p>Sugar costs 80 cents per pound, and I need about a third of a pound per day, so that’s about 30 cents per day.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Total cost for the base need smoothie comes out to around 7 dollars and 10 cents.</p>
<p>If we swap the gelatin out for egg whites, we get a little bit of carbs, but, assuming the cost is only in protein<a href="#fn0115" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref15"><sup>15</sup></a>, we can start pricing out the price per gram of protein for different foods:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Gelatin: 7.5 cents</p></li>
<li><p>Egg White: 4.7 cents</p></li>
<li><p>Whey Protein: 6.5 cents<a href="#fn0116" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Chicken breast comes out to around 4 cents per ounce</p></li>
<li><p>Flour technically has protein, though incomplete, and so is being discarded<a href="#fn0117" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Generally seems like peanuts are complete, and come in at 1.9 cents, or 2.3 if I don’t want to bother shelling them myself.</p></li>
<li><p>Beans also appear to contain all amino acids, and come in at 1 cent per gram as pinto beans</p></li>
<li><p>Rice can come down to 1.6 cents per gram</p></li>
<li><p>Lentils are around 1.4 cents</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Gelatin and egg whites are both about 1.6 grams per gram of protein, whey protein is about 1.1, and pinto beans are about 5, so it does require significantly more bean consumption. It also takes me well over the minimum carb load for the day, which also saves me 30 cents in sugar. It would, however, require consuming a full pound of beans<a href="#fn0118" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref18"><sup>18</sup></a> each day. Egg whites probably strike a good balance of volume and cost.</p>
<p>Now that we have gone through this, we also need to remember the whole “there is a limit of calories I can, or at least should, consume in a day.” At the 3500 calorie mark, that means everything needs to be under 40 calories per gram of protein in order to be a valid source of all protein I consume.</p>
<p>Also, if I do the insane thing of bulk buying gelatin, I can get it for as cheap as 40 percent the cost, bringing it down to 3 cents per gram, which is honestly kind of tempting. It does, however, require purchasing 50 pounds of gelatin, which would serve me for around half a year. It would take us down to under three dollars a day.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/research/cnpp/usda-food-plans/cost-food-monthly-reports">USDA</a>, as long as I’m spending under 10 dollars and nine cents a day, I’m doing well.</p>
<p>This has absolutely degraded from the initial goal of figuring out how to feed myself well, for all that it would, without a doubt, be a very easy and effective way to get myself all of the nutrients I need in a day. I do wonder if I would be able to eat enough fruit and vegetable in a day to feel satiated.</p>

<h1 id="initial-reflection-on-dietary-needs"><a href="dietary-needs.html">Initial Reflection on Dietary Needs</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 8 January 2025</p>
<h1 id="draft-2-8-january-2025">Draft 2: 8 January 2025</h1>
<p>As I’ve mentioned in a fair number of musings, I want to be better at fueling my body. That means that I’m going to aim for a few goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Macronutrients all at acceptable levels</p></li>
<li><p>Unprocessed or less processed foods where possible</p></li>
<li><p>More fruits and vegetables, generally aiming for dark green, red, orange, legumes, starches to be each represented.</p></li>
<li><p>Easy, in mental, physical, and temporal meanings.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.nal.usda.gov/human-nutrition-and-food-safety/dri-calculator/">both lets me</a> get some estimates and gives me the actual links to the book where the USDA lays out their explicit recommendations. Unfortunately, those PDFs do not give citations, but I will trust that the data are at least generally good. With that in mind, the goals I should be hitting:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At least a gallon of total water per day. I generally feel like I should be drinking around that much, if I go by the whole “drink when you’re thirsty” mantra.</p></li>
<li><p>An absolute floor of <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/11537/chapter/10">130 grams</a> of carbohydrates a day.<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>If I trust the AMDR, which is at the very least a decent starting place, I should be getting between 45 and 65 percent of calories from carbs, 25 to 35 percent fat, and 10 to 30 protein. I can hit the thresholds of at least one of them without breaking the system, which is good.</p></li>
<li><p>I should be getting <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/11537/chapter/14">around 0.8</a> grams of protein per kilogram of body mass per day, bringing us to around 90 grams of protein.</p></li>
<li><p>In that, I apparently absolutely have to have: histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalinine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. I should make sure that I have the prerequisites, or take in: arginine, cysteine, glutamine, glycine, proline, and tyrosine. <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/11537/chapter/53#464">daily, that means</a>:<a href="#fn022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>19 histidine</p></li>
<li><p>30 Isoleucine</p></li>
<li><p>62 leucine</p></li>
<li><p>52 lysine</p></li>
<li><p>26 methionine and cysteine (combined, I assume)</p></li>
<li><p>51 phenylalanine and tyrosine (combined, I assume)</p></li>
<li><p>30 threonine</p></li>
<li><p>9 tryptophan</p></li>
<li><p>35 valine</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, because I am not completely insane, I probably won’t be very much harping on all of these points, but it’s at least generally good to keep in mind. Protein makes body run, and generally there don’t seem to be side effects from too much protein or of any amino acid, so floors are almost certainly sufficient in themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>Fat, unfortunately, lacks RDA, and instead only has Adequate Intake (AI). It’s broken down into Linoleic and alpha Linoleic acids, which need 17 and 1.6 g/kg/day, respectively. Apparently outside of that, there’s not evidence to suggest any other recommendations for fat, though I assume that percents are generally at least somewhat supported as normally decent for each piece. LDL is linked to increased saturated<a href="#fn023" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref3"><sup>3</sup></a> fat content, and LDL is generally not great. Linoleic acid is an essential fatty acid, and it produces the n-6 fatty acids. It is not immediately clear to me what it does. Alpha is also essential, produces n-3, and is needed to balance n3 and n6 acids, as well as helping structural nerves especially in the nerves and retina. AIs were set from the median in the US, because there’s no common deficit. In general, no American or Canadian is lacking in either of those fats, which is a nice, if unsurprising result.</p></li>
<li><p>So, in general, fat can make up the rest of my diet, I should aim for less saturated fats, and also make sure I consume the proper fatty acids. My body can make all of them except for linoleic and alpha linoleic acids. They’re important for growth, but I am no longer a child, and so no longer really grow.</p></li>
<li><p>Higher fat diets (relative to carbs) tend to be better the more sedentary the population is. Given how sedentary I am, probably good to err on the side of more fat. Athletes may need higher carb diets, especially in the short term,</p></li>
<li><p>Added sugar bad.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, so that’s interesting and good enough. It’s always nice to confirm that there’s a large range of completely acceptable values for every macronutrient. The micros I will assume I can hit if I get a diverse diet in, at least for now. Now comes the much harder part: generating an actual diet.</p>
<p>I think that having the list of colors is a thing I need to do when plotting literally any meal, and especially while shopping. I think that it’s also probably best to have as much of what I’m cooking as things that I can generally do in batches that requires minimal in person effort. The absolute ideal, is of course, something like the classic crock pot meal, which is a turn on whenever and come back to whenever, with no real time considerations other than a floor.</p>
<p>I know myself well enough to know that I do, legitimately, enjoy cooking when I can, and that I hate following recipes. Those two conditions make a lot of meal planning hard, as does my tendency to forget things when they’re out of sight and to fall into chaos at the slightest provocation. However!</p>
<p>Hope is not lost. I do know myself well enough to know that when I have a list, even if it’s vague, I can often follow along with them, especially when I have a reason to do so.<a href="#fn024" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>I think that this may be more than a single blog post is able to have, but I will definetly try to start making vague measurements in my recipes, so that I can both recreate them and see what the health information in them is. Additionally, that can let me start experimenting with different changes to each recipe. For instance, yesterday I baked a loaf of sandwich bread where I substituted yogurt for milk and added some almond flour.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-8-january-2025">Draft 1: 8 January 2025</h1>
<p>As I’ve mentioned a fair amount in the recent musings, I want to be better about feeding myself. There are any number of reasons for this, but if I’m being honest, it’s mostly due to the loss of my mother.<a href="#fn025" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref5"><sup>5</sup></a> With that in mind, there are some general guidelines that I’m going to try to keep in mind going forward.<a href="#fn026" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Get sufficient macros in. I know that I, personally, don’t feel great when I don’t get enough protein in.<a href="#fn027" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Focus on more whole grain and less processed food generally</p></li>
<li><p>I often see fiber as a point that needs to be addressed. I’m not sure how true that is in my case, especially given the above item, but I’ll at least ball park it to make sure I’m there.</p></li>
<li><p>The CDC <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpao/features/healthy-eating-tips/index.html">that I need more potassium</a>, likely. That’s interesting, at least.</p></li>
<li><p>Saturated fats are allegedly bad, though I keep wanting to look up why that is.<a href="#fn028" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Looking at the Harvard link from the footnote, seems mostly like polyunsaturated fats, like corn and sunflower oil, are essential for bodily function. Other than that, more liquid at room temperature probably better, but not something to hugely stress about.</p></li>
<li><p>Increase the variety and quantity of fruits and vegetables in my diet. I know that I probably don’t get enough pretty colors, especially because I tend to go through phases of a single plant.<a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/how-the-dietary-guidelines-define-a-healthy-eating-pattern">A Harvard page</a> claims that the groups I need to hit are: dark green, red, and orange legumes, and starchy.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t be super fussy in the day to day. The goal is that this is a background process, both because I want to not spend time and energy on this, and also because literature generally says good enough is, in fact, good enough.</p></li>
<li><p>Make it something that I can do easily. That can mean different things to me at different periods of my life, but I think that it’s just a good thing to keep in mind in general.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Alrighty, that’s a pretty doable set of items. With that in mind, let’s start being explicit with some numbers<a href="#fn029" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref9"><sup>9</sup></a>. Thankfully, <a href="https://www.nal.usda.gov/human-nutrition-and-food-safety/dri-calculator">Uncle Sam</a> has us covered with that. These days, I do unfortunately think that I am Inactive to Low Active based on their terms, though that is something I’d like to change:<a href="#fn0210" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>16 cups of water, including everything in the foods I consume. That’s one gallon, and does change when I play with numbers, so that’s fun.</p></li>
<li><p>About 3500 calories a day. Oof that’s going to be fun and difficult. Of course, if I’m going for a slight deficit<a href="#fn0211" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref11"><sup>11</sup></a>, that’s ok too.</p></li>
<li><p>90 grams of protein. Some quick googling suggests approx. 4 calories per gram, so 360 cals from protein<a href="#fn0212" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Somewhere from 75 to 135 grams of fat per day. 9 Cal/g, so 675 to 1215.<a href="#fn0213" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Carbs are essential for brain function, or so claims <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/11537/chapter/10#103">the USDA</a>. The recommended amount is listed by the amount expected to be needed for brain function, and explicitly prevents ketosis. Because all brains are basically the same size, carbohydrate recommendations plateau at the age of 1, and remain at around 130 grams after that. However, if we look at the numbers, that doesn’t work out</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I’m realizing that I’m losing the thread, so let’s restart.</p>

<p>First Published:</p>
<h1 id="draft-two-7-january-2025">Draft Two: 7 January 2025</h1>
<p>N.B. In the interest of having single day drafts, this is the first draft up until reflection of July 2023.</p>
<p>I generally title posts like this a reflection, for a few reasons. Mostly, I want to use it as a way of seeing what goals I’ve had, kept, lost, and picked up. However, this musing is meant to serve a different role.</p>
<p>Up to this point, I’ve mostly been treating what’s changed in my life as though it’s no more a change than any other sudden shift, like studying abroad or graduating. I don’t know if even now I’ve come to terms with all of the ways that my life is forever fundamentally altered for having lost my mother. Goals that relied, in any way, shape, or form, on her direct motivation<a href="#fn031" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> need new reasons. So, even as I look back at my past to see what my goals once were, my focus today is almost entirely on the future. I am willing to discard any goal I once had that no longer serves me.<a href="#fn032" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Time to go through every reflection I’ve had.<a href="#fn033" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Back in <a href="reflection-january-19">January of 2019</a>, I had the goal of writing a sonnet every day. I do think that forcing myself to do something creative, in both senses of the word, and analog before bed time is ultimately good for me. Much as I think this, however, I don’t love sonnet form. I’m tempted to try common verse, because I do really enjoy alternating tetrameter and triameter. However, unlike a sonnet, common verse does not have a set number of stanzas or lines. Worth considering, at least.</p>
<p><a href="reflection-january-22">Three years later</a><a href="#fn034" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref4"><sup>4</sup></a>, I wanted to blog daily<a href="#fn035" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref5"><sup>5</sup></a>. I was working through the Bible in a Year that year, and had the goal of keeping up on it. I also wanted to work on working out and writing music.</p>
<p>Apparently <a href="reflection-february-22">that February</a> was the only February I reflected on. Interesting that I lose focus in the springtime. More or less, the same as January, though with working on my book<a href="#fn036" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref6"><sup>6</sup></a> added in.</p>
<p><a href="reflection-march-2022">March</a> has also only been reflected on once, and I misdid the naming of the url. As before, with practicing guitar added in.</p>
<p>In <a href="reflection-april-2022">April</a>, I wanted to finish a draft of a paper I needed to write.</p>
<p><a href="reflection-june-2022">June</a><a href="#fn037" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref7"><sup>7</sup></a> brought the idea of listing the exciting things that had happened to me in the past month. That’s probably something that’s worth bringing back? It also added the goals of accordion practice and writing short stories.</p>
<p><a href="reflection-july-2022">In July</a> I wanted to be able to run a little over five miles continuously, stretch, work on an exam, and revise my book.<a href="#fn038" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Poems, journaling,<a href="#fn039" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref9"><sup>9</sup></a> and curricular development were my <a href="reflection-august-2022">August goals</a> of note.</p>
<p><a href="reflection-september-2022">September</a> had me hoping to work on my 24 for 24 list.<a href="#fn0310" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>I wanted to do NaNoWriMo and fill out 24 for 24 in <a href="reflection-october-24">October</a>.</p>
<p>NOTE: At this point in the musing, I realized that I’ve been looking at the goals moving forward, so generally transpose all the goals forward one time unit.</p>
<p>I had the insane goal in <a href="reflection-november-24">November or December</a> of that year of writing another 50K word book.</p>
<p>On the start of <a href="reflection-2022">2023</a>, I wanted to add daily rosaries to my list, along with working through the Catechism in a Year.</p>
<p><a href="reflection-january-23">February</a> brought no new goals.</p>
<p>In <a href="reflection-april-23">May</a> of that year, I split my goals into professional, personal, and growth. In general, they were single things that I needed to accomplish, and I should not forget the value of static goals. I also wanted to get back into bagpiping, which is also a thing I miss. Wildly, I hadn’t written any public outreach talks at that point. I know that it’s something I really started in graduate school, but it’s so weird to me that I only really started to do it about 20 months ago.</p>
<p><a href="reflection-may-23">June</a> had me counting my monthly words, and split goals into finite<a href="#fn0311" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref11"><sup>11</sup></a> and growth. I wanted to get up at 6am daily, get ahead on my book, and write letters to friends. I also wanted to invite friends over to my home, because I was happy with its state.<a href="#fn0312" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>That same month, I also reflected <a href="reflection-monthly-reflection">on the reflections themselves.</a> In that post, I introduced my concept of actually tracking my goals.<a href="#fn0313" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>In <a href="reflection-june-23">July</a>, I wanted to be able to have friends over, which necessitated a clean home. That’s really it for changes.</p>
<p><a href="reflection-july-23">August</a> brought the goal of finishing a talk and nothing else.</p>
<p><a href="reflection-august-23">September</a> had me reflecting forwards<a href="#fn0314" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref14"><sup>14</sup></a> on what excited me about the coming month, which seems like a good goal. I also started work on my album, which I have yet to finish.</p>
<p><a href="reflection-september-23">In October</a> I gave small snippets of explanation for why each goal was set.<a href="#fn0315" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="reflection-october-23">November</a> had me commenting that the month had passed me by for reasons I should have remembered. I don’t know if I recall them right now. It’s distinctly possible that October of 2023 was when I found out about my mother’s illness. I was apparently doing well enough at prayer then that I wanted to do better than a rushed rosary.</p>
<p><a href="reflection-2023">At the dawn of last year</a>, I kept up my tradition of five things that I was excited for in the coming year. Let’s see how I did:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Publishing my first first author paper -&gt; Did not do, likely because I lost most of the summer and fall</p></li>
<li><p>Giving an invited lecture at a university -&gt; I did this, but also like that was kind of already set up.</p></li>
<li><p>I’m excited to grow in my relationships -&gt; I would like to think that I’ve done so, though it certainly fell apart as the year progressed.</p></li>
<li><p>I’m once again also excited to watch my little brother graduate -&gt; It was fantastic, though bittersweet for it just being my brothers and me there.</p></li>
<li><p>I’m excited to record an album -&gt; I did not finish any of the songs, though I did share a decent recording of one of them with my mom.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I may as well also list five good things that happened to me last year that I did not list:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Getting a new underclassman on my project. The new student has been fantastic and really revitalized me</p></li>
<li><p>Learning to embroider</p></li>
<li><p>Figured out where I want to end up in a career</p></li>
<li><p>Got my family into a dumb marble racing show.</p></li>
<li><p>Ta’d introductory astronomy</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I did also want to swim a mile, learn a polka, read through all my books. I did none of those, though I was generally ok at finishing the rest of my goals.</p>
<p>Nothing really new <a href="reflection-2024a">in July</a>, though that came with my acknowledgment that I more or less had given up on blogging.</p>
<p>At the <a href="reflection-2024b">end of last year</a>, I made a list of more or less every goal I had at the time. I then spent some time sorting them into different categories, like finite and infinite, goals for the near and far future, etc.</p>
<p>So, what have I learned from going through all my reflections?</p>
<p>In general, I always want to blog more, stretch more, and exercise more. Most of the time I want to pray more. I have also gone through different phases for how I reflect.</p>
<p>Going forwards, I think that I would like to continue monthly reflections, and I would like to do a few forward looking and backwards looking experiences. Looking through the goals from my last reflection, there are some changes and some similarities from there. So, what does this mean for me?</p>
<p>In 2025, I am excited to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have a timeline for finishing my Ph.D.<a href="#fn0316" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Once again, continue to grow in my relationships.<a href="#fn0317" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Write a song for another friend’s wedding.</p></li>
<li><p><span>initially: Mature in my faith. It’s been a rough past few months, but I think that it will ultimately end up as a net benefit to me.</span> It’s been great to be able to help my friends experience the best day of their lives<a href="#fn0318" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref18"><sup>18</sup></a> and enhance it with the meager<a href="#fn0319" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref19"><sup>19</sup></a> talents for music I possess.</p></li>
<li><p>Feed myself better. I’ve gotten better and better about it, and these past few months in particular have been really good to me in this regard, if nothing else.</p></li>
<li><p>Find a way to live with my grief. So far it’s been alternating repression and collapse, though it’s definitely been more of a damped wave than an amplified or static one.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Goals for this year<a href="#fn0320" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref20"><sup>20</sup></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Make significant progress on writing my thesis. Regardless of the timeline, it’s always better to have written than not to have written.</p></li>
<li><p>Come to terms with my grief. As mentioned above, I feel like it’s a necessary thing to do.</p></li>
<li><p>Find a sustainable way to feed myself. As mentioned above, I’m making progress on it, but it’s certainly not fully there.</p></li>
<li><p>Find a way to write my web novel sustainably. I miss writing it, and I really miss interacting with my friends and family about the new chapters, to say nothing of the joy I get seeing random internet strangers praise me.</p></li>
<li><p>Stop wasting time. That’s not to say stop taking breaks, but there are many things that I spend time on that I don’t value, and that don’t help me grow into the person I want to be. It’s a journey for sure, but I’d at least like to feel like more of my days are being spent in service of growth.</p></li>
<li><p>Get back into letter writing. This ties in really well with growing in my relationships, but also I feel like I have not been doing enough handwriting these days, and certainly not enough reflecting.</p></li>
<li><p>Get back into journalling. As with blogging, it’s a use of time that I’m always grateful for.</p></li>
<li><p>Learn to draw. I had that going for a little bit last year, but then the holidays came and destroyed my schedule.</p></li>
<li><p>Finish the album.</p></li>
<li><p>Get back into classical<a href="#fn0321" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref21"><sup>21</sup></a> composition.</p></li>
<li><p>Find a way to bring fitness into a routine. I’ve generally been good about at least doing a bit of stretching in the morning, but I know that I could improve on that.</p></li>
<li><p>Blog daily. This goal is absolutely my white whale, but it’s still my goal</p></li>
<li><p>Grow interpersonally.</p></li>
<li><p>Become more comfortable with myself.</p></li>
<li><p>Art. I don’t know in what ways I want to be doing art, but I know that I want non-musical art to be a part of my life.<a href="#fn0322" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Music. In general, I want to start building proficiency in my main instruments. Well, I do want to gain proficiency in every instrument, but that’s not plausible, if only because I don’t have every instrument. These days, that’s singing, guitar, and accordion.</p></li>
<li><p>Clean my life.</p></li>
<li><p>Learn to draw.</p></li>
<li><p>Do 26 for 26.<a href="#fn0323" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Looking more short term, what are my goals for the rest of the month?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Music:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I don’t really think that this month is calling me to ensemble or classical composition.</p></li>
<li><p>Work on the album for at least an hour each Saturday, and find another half hour sometime in the week.</p></li>
<li><p>Practice guitar and accordion. I’d like to say twice daily, but at least once for both.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Art:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Continue working on the embroidery project. It brings me peace to do it.</p></li>
<li><p>Work on art at least 3x a week. I have the drawing space all set up, now it’s just a matter of doing it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Exercise:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Continue/improve at stretching in the morning and evening.</p></li>
<li><p>Start going to the group fitness classes.</p></li>
<li><p>I’m going to put food in here, so do my blog post or at least a personal posting about my macro needs</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Write and send at least a letter a week. Probably do that on Saturdays.</p></li>
<li><p>Journal every morning, at least five minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>Write some poetry every night.</p></li>
<li><p>Start writing my web novel again.</p></li>
<li><p>Blog daily.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Grow in prayer</p></li>
</ul>
<p>That’s a fair number of goals. How can we make this a daily and weekly check?</p>
<p>Daily:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Practiced guitar?</p></li>
<li><p>Practiced accordion?</p></li>
<li><p>Twice daily stretching?</p></li>
<li><p>Journal?</p></li>
<li><p>Poetry?</p></li>
<li><p>Blog?</p></li>
<li><p>Net cleaner home?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Weekly:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Embroidered?</p></li>
<li><p>Drew on Monday, Saturday, Sunday?</p></li>
<li><p>Group Fitness?</p></li>
<li><p>Letter?</p></li>
<li><p>Web Novel?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, that doesn’t actually seem so bad. Saturdays seem like they’ll start to be filled with activities which lead me to growth, which is always really nice. In general I do tend to find that I spend too much time wasting away on Saturdays, since I tend not to have anything in particular scheduled to do.</p>

<p>First Published: 2025 January 6</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-6-january-2025">Draft 1: 6 January 2025</h1>
<p>I started to write this musing on Christmas morning. It was a Christmas unlike I’ve ever had before, though for almost no positive reasons. I woke up alone in my empty home, with neither tree nor any decorations.</p>
<p>Last <a href="christmas-2023.html">Christmas</a><a href="#fn041" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> I mused about the different Christmas traditions my family had.<a href="#fn042" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> This Christmas, we abandoned most of the traditions, for a few different reasons.</p>
<p>We kept the pajama exchange, though it felt far less homey, given that I had to walk a few blocks in them in order to sit with my father and brothers. We kept the photo with Santa and the family selfie, though I no longer had to angle the camera far down. We kept the generally low energy vibes, though with a flavor of sorrow rather than joy underpinning it.</p>
<p>Having spent a year without the traditions, my family and I all agree that we do, in fact, like all the traditions we have and want to bring them back next year. Of course, there will be a gigantic hole in the midst of that<a href="#fn043" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref3"><sup>3</sup></a> celebration, but that is something that we’re going to have to work around. I don’t know what metaphor will end up being the most true here, whether the hole will grow smaller in time, be covered over by new threads of life experiences, or simply avoided, as a scar in the ground. Regardless, I am grateful for the past year, the coming year, and whatever time I have left on this world.</p>
<h1 id="draft-0-25-december-2024">Draft 0: 25 December 2024</h1>
<p>As much as I’m glad that last year’s musing about Christmas contained our traditions, because I have already forgotten them, reading them was very difficult. So much has changed from last year, and some of it was even my fault. We are not at home</p>

<h1 id="reflections-on-todays-gospel"><a href="reflections-on-readings-3-advent-c-24.html">Reflections on Today’s Gospel</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2024 December 15</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>It may have taken 6 years, but I’m finally reflecting on the same Sunday Gospel more than once. While reading today, the two things that most struck me were the fact that the first paragraph of the gospel was almost entirely secular advice, and the second half was almost entirely spiritual. I know that the distinction is not necessarily true, but an atheist should take no issue with anything in the first paragraph.</p>
<p>My other major takeaway was the wheat and the chaff. Since fire was used in reference both to baptism and the burning of the chaff, I read it as saying that we are the wheat whose chaff is being burned off. Chaff, as we all know, is not something independent of wheat. It is the outer covering, which we remove because we don’t want it. Likewise, the sin in us is the chaff that we need to not just separate from, but burn away entirely through the healing power of Christ.</p>
<p>I’m really fatigued today, so that’s all I have, other than a quick look to see what has changed in the past six years.</p>
<p>Ooh! I focused on the fact that it was Advent, and mentioned that we should focus more on the joy aspect of the faith. That’s still true, but it’s interesting how my takeaways have changed through the years.</p>

<h1 id="learning-to-draw"><a href="learning-drawing.html">Learning to Draw</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2024 December 14</p>
<h1 id="draft-two">Draft Two</h1>
<p>Visual art and music have always felt completely separate to me, in a way that I don’t really think is true of most people. Given the fact that both are what people will point to as “the arts”, or “fine arts”, there’s at least some level of correlation. I can understand part of it. After all, both are endeavors which fundamentally require conveying something within ourselves to the world outside, in a way that isn’t as true for other activities. Both are seen as fundamental to humanity.</p>
<p>As I think about why I consider the two forms so different, I think that the artifacts of practice are incredibly important. When practicing music, there is no direct evidence once you have finished. The notes fade, sound waves dampened by everything around you. When finishing a practice of visual media, by contrast, the page is full of every mistake you’ve made.</p>
<p>The fear at the idea seeing my own mistakes, and the pain of actually witnessing the work I was proud of a day ago has certainly been a discouragement from my continuing the practice. I also don’t know that I’ve ever really figured out a good way to practice the skill. With writing, for instance, I know that everything I write will, on some level, improve all of my writing. I also have relatively clear demarcations for what practice will most impact what part of my craft.<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The same is true of music.</p>
<p>In drawing, by contrast,<a href="#fn062" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> I know that line and shape and form are important, but I still don’t see how studying one thing inherently leads to improved ability to draw something else. On the same thread, I also do not have anything that has ever been a huge motivation as a relatively large project. Even to this day, a motivation for at least some of my music practice is upcoming public performances, which weigh heavily on me. I write as a part of my job. Drawing is not something I’ve done.</p>
<p>And yet, this musing is not about my historical struggles with drawing, it’s about my current goals to learn how to draw. I’ve been working on the skill since about the day that my mother died. I think that it was the next day that I got a sketchbook and started to draw. Primarily I’ve been focusing on figure drawing.</p>
<p>I don’t really know why that is. Certainly I like figures in art, and at least some of the art that I want to create has the human body as a part of it, but I think that a larger reason might just be that the media about learning to draw I’ve consumed lately has been focused on people’s own goals to learn to draw form.</p>
<p>As I continue to draw the human form, though, I am more and more finding the ways that small gestures really do mean the difference between something completely discordant and something pleasant to look at. Simply thickening a line where there is shadow in a reference image adds a surprising amount of depth to the drawing. All this to say, I feel like I’m making progress, even though I don’t really want to go back and see if it’s true. I’m hoping to dedicate some time as I continue to move forward in my life to actively studying how to do it better.</p>
<h1 id="draft-one">Draft One</h1>
<p>Interestingly, it seems that I’ve only ever mused about drawing a single time, almost three years ago now.<a href="#fn063" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref3"><sup>3</sup></a> As my goals right now hopefully indicate, I’ve decided that right now I want to learn to draw. I don’t think that this is a new goal, but it’s never been something that I have put for a sustained effort on.</p>
<p>I’m really not sure why I never really learned how to draw. For reference, when I say draw here, I’m using it in the sense of still life or figure, or generally of something vaguely resembling realism. I’ve done plenty of nonrepresentative art<a href="#fn064" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref4"><sup>4</sup></a>, and I have run up against the borders of insanity more than a few times constructing a knot. Despite this, I still don’t really think that I can draw a guitar, even though there is one sitting in front of me at this exact moment and I can perfectly picture one in my mind.</p>
<p>When reading about learning to draw, a lot of the stories end up similar to those that I see in music spaces from those who enter later in life. Someone, either an authority figure or the general air of authority, convinced people that they were not musical at some fundamental level. Probably because I am a relatively competent musician<a href="#fn065" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref5"><sup>5</sup></a>, I do not think that was ever the case for me. I also do not lack inspiration for things I would draw. My mind is filled with countless fantastical images that I wish I could convey to the world.</p>
<p>Especially since I have spent the past six<a href="#fn066" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref6"><sup>6</sup></a> or so years working on my penmanship, it seems more than a little strange that I haven’t really spent a lot of time with drawing. Of course, paging through my old notebooks does show a good number of pages with different amounts of pedagogically sound drawing practice. Unlike the music that runs through the books, however, there is no through line.</p>

<h1 id="brain-training"><a href="brain-training.tex">Brain Training</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2024 December 13</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>Because I am actively trying to return my library books right now<a href="#fn071" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, I’ve started to actually try to read them. A past version of me was incredibly optimistic, and thought that I would be able to read through tomes upon tomes of information about historical science and synthesiz it into my public facing talks. Of course, life happened, and I did not end up doing so.<a href="#fn072" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In attempting to read some books which are little more than collections of essays, I have come to realize that I’ve somewhat lost the ability to read essays, especially social science essays. Thinking about my brain as a muscle may have problems from a psychological standpoint<a href="#fn073" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, but it’s been something useful for me in the past. Just like how swimming is harder after taking a break, so too is it harder not just to think, but to think in any particular thought pattern after taking an extended break from it. I recently noticed where my mental strength had waned on Sunday as I tried to write a hymn harmonization. For whatever reasons, I most often find myself writing polyphonic music, or at least homorhythmic music.<a href="#fn074" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn075" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Hymns, by contrast, are almost always homophonic.</p>
<p>That is, there is one single line that can be clearly pointed to as <strong>the</strong> melody, and the rest act to support it. At a more fundamental level, though, I do not work in the realm of tonal harmony that often.<a href="#fn076" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Sure, many of the folk songs that I write take the standard I IV V approach, but the music I listen to, cover, and especially write for choirs do not rely on that very limited harmony. Hymns, as a genre, however, operate completely within that sphere. Because I have minimal interest in writing tonal homophony, I was very comfortable with the fact that I have lost those skills.<a href="#fn077" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref7"><sup>7</sup></a> By contrast, I’ve realized that I cannot read essays, especially in the way that I used to, and that is something which concerns me, at least a little. I don’t know where the mental fortitude to slog through dense words that are written from an expert in a field to another expert in the same field has gone, but I do know at least a few reasons why I’ve lost it. First, scientific papers are rarely written as essay. These days, most of the time the abstract and conclusion are all that need to be read. If attempting to copy an experiment, than a brief skim of the experimental section is usually sufficient. I am also rarely attempting to do pure literature reviews, where I synthesize a number of papers into a single document without adding new information of my own.<a href="#fn078" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Now I guess I have to ask myself whether that’s a skill I want back, and if so, how much effort I’m willing to put into it.</p>

<p>I found myself struggling to think of a topic for today’s musing.<a href="#fn079" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Potentially relatedly, I’ve been trying to get through the long list of library books that I checked out from the library at my school. Among them are books that have come recommended to me and a number of books I’ve found by simply wandering the stacks. I often forget that History of Science is its own field, and that tends to be to my own detriment. Because of the fact that it is History of, the field’s output more closely resembles that of history than that of science. That does make sense, given that it is tools and techniques from history which enable the research. However, it does mean that I’m being confronted with a fact that I haven’t had reason to realize: I’ve lost my ability to read essays. Hmmm, this is a little too off the topic.</p>

<h1 id="donut-recipe"><a href="donut-recipe.html">Donut Recipe</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2024 December 12</p>
<h1 id="draft-one">Draft One</h1>
<p>Wildly enough, I don’t think that I’ve ever written a blog post with the word “recipe” in the url. I’m almost positive that I’ve given at least a few recipes, so that might be a bit of an issue. However, that is not the purpose of today’s musing. As the title<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> probably indicated, I’m going to talk about my donut recipe.</p>
<p>As with most of the things that I cook these days, there was minimal measuring involved. In general, this tends to work out, because I generally work with continuous ingredients.<a href="#fn082" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> That is, if the dough is ever so slightly too dry, I can add functionally any amount of water to the dough to hydrate it slightly more. In the specific case of the donut<a href="#fn083" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref3"><sup>3</sup></a> dough, though, I do somewhat regret not measuring anything, because I used one of the only discrete ingredients in the average baker’s toolkit<a href="#fn084" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref4"><sup>4</sup></a>: the egg.<a href="#fn085" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>As a result, rather than simply describing a texture, I feel somewhat as though I need to at least approximate the recipe I used. My best guess is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Three cups bread flour<a href="#fn086" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>2 large<a href="#fn087" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref7"><sup>7</sup></a> eggs</p></li>
<li><p>Heavy splash of orange liqueur<a href="#fn088" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Two thirds a cup of sugar</p></li>
<li><p>Heavy pinch of salt</p></li>
<li><p>Heavy splash of vanilla extract</p></li>
<li><p>Yeast, approx 1 tablespoon<a href="#fn089" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>One cup whole milk</p></li>
<li><p>2 oz water</p></li>
<li><p>1 tsp yeast</p></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><p>Pour flour, sugar, liqueur, salt, vanilla, and first tablespoon of yeast into a large bowl.</p></li>
<li><p>Crack in two large eggs</p></li>
<li><p>Pour the milk on top and stir with a wooden spoon<a href="#fn0810" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref10"><sup>10</sup></a>. Texture should be about the same as slime, or slightly thicker. That is, it should be very sticky, but when you stir, you should easily watch it pull away from the edges of the bowl.</p></li>
<li><p>Cover and let sit for two hours.<a href="#fn0811" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>After two hours, remember that for some reason you can never get yeast to rise when poured directly in milk, so add final tsp of yeast into water in a small container. Wait until frothy and stir into the dough.</p></li>
<li><p>Cover and wait 68 hours.<a href="#fn0812" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Dough should be approximately doubled in volume. Punch it down by using spoon to lever the dough off the rim of the bowl.<a href="#fn0813" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Because it is a very wet dough, might take some effort to deflate.</p></li>
<li><p>Cover again and wait until clearly risen once again</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Now, I am always a fan of doing things a little extra. The previous time I made an iteration of this recipe<a href="#fn0814" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref14"><sup>14</sup></a>, I think that I wrapped the dough around oreos. This time, at request of the people I am feeding them to, I had three fillings: oreo, biscoff, and whole strawberries. With this in mind, recipe will continue:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>If filling donut with a solid, take enough dough<a href="#fn0815" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref15"><sup>15</sup></a> to cover the object and wrap it. Because we used high protein flour, you can stretch the dough a fair amount. Don’t<a href="#fn0816" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref16"><sup>16</sup></a> worry about that, the donuts will puff in the oven. The older cookbook I found recommends rolling to 3/8 inch thick and cutting from there, so if afraid, use that as a baseline</p></li>
<li><p>As each donut is made, place it on a greased sheet pan<a href="#fn0817" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref17"><sup>17</sup></a>. It is ideal to wait at least five minutes after forming the donuts before frying them, though if you wait to heat your oil until you’ve finished shaping the donuts, you’ll likely be fine</p></li>
<li><p>When filling, dough, or shaper is exhausted, heat a pot full of a good frying oil to 350<a href="#fn0818" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Follow normal frying safety when frying.</p></li>
<li><p>When oil reaches 350F<a href="#fn0819" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref19"><sup>19</sup></a>, add as many donuts as you see fit. I found that in my wok, 1214 was about as many as I could reasonably fit, though I did manage 20 at once.</p></li>
<li><p>Using a wooden spoon<a href="#fn0820" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref20"><sup>20</sup></a>, gently stir the donuts as they fry, flipping them if one side appears to be blonder than the other.</p></li>
<li><p>Pull from oil when golden brown<a href="#fn0821" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref21"><sup>21</sup></a>, drain, and let cool on paper towels.<a href="#fn0822" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>When cool enough to handle<a href="#fn0823" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref23"><sup>23</sup></a>, dip in icing of choice.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow to cool fully! This is an important one, because the inside will likely retain heat better than the outside.<a href="#fn0824" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p></li>
</ol>
<p>By mentioning the icing, some might wonder about the recipe. The oreo donuts were topped with vanilla icing, and the strawberry were topped with a lemon icing.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Vanilla Icing: Powdered sugar, splash of vanilla, and enough milk to make it barely a liquid while being constantly stirred. Adjust vanilla to taste</p></li>
<li><p>Lemon Icing: Zest lemon into powdered sugar, wait a few minutes, stir in the juice of the lemon, again until just barely liquid when actively being agitated.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I think that about sums it up!</p>

<li id="fn084"><p>I did absolutely sit and think for a long little bit about what ingredients might be in a baker’s kit that are functionally discrete. Chocolate chips are, but almost never will they be treated as such, since they normally are done by volume.

<h1 id="goal-updates-and-scheduling"><a href="goal-updates.html">Goal Updates and Scheduling</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2024 December 10</p>
<h1 id="draft-one">Draft One:</h1>
<p>I know that I literally made the goals less than a week ago, but I have already forgotten them. With that in mind, I think that it might be good to start going through the goals I’ve accomplished, and organizing the ones I have left so I have a reminder.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>One offs:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Talk to boss about Ph.D. timeline</p></li>
<li><p>Pick a topic for a science communication article</p></li>
<li><p>Find an occasion I could write a song for</p></li>
<li><p>Make a list of the stretches I’ll do each day</p></li>
<li><p>Find a place to volunteer</p></li>
<li><p>Paper hit list</p></li>
<li><p>Read the comments on the serial</p></li>
<li><p>Compile a list of people I want to write letters to</p></li>
<li><p>Muse about macros and micros</p></li>
<li><p>Compile a list of 20 meals that I can make, with their ingredients (inc. shelf stable or lifetime), time, effort level, and nutrition info</p></li>
<li><p>Come up with an ordered list for what I’ll read</p></li>
<li><p>Figure out my motivation for each book and have it as the bookmark</p></li>
<li><p>List of things that need to be cleaned and the frequency</p></li>
<li><p>List of things in my life</p></li>
<li><p>Decide on what I want to draw right now</p></li>
<li><p>Make a list of musings to do</p></li>
<li><p>Block out time on Sundays for gospel reflection</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Weekly:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Read a pop sci article a week, making notes about how they work</p></li>
<li><p>Spend 30 minutes 2x a week working on writing the song</p></li>
<li><p>On Sundays, write a hymn harmonization for one of the hymns we sang</p></li>
<li><p>Muse on Sundays about the Gospel</p></li>
<li><p>Read readings on Saturday</p></li>
<li><p>Ten minutes 4x a week on drawing</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Daily:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Define how I’m feeling each day at start and end</p></li>
<li><p>Practice guitar daily (at least one scale and a chord progression)</p></li>
<li><p>Muse daily</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch Twice a day</p></li>
<li><p>Walk to the gym every day</p></li>
<li><p>Do daily affirmations</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Having forgotten about most of these, stretching is really the only one I’ve been particularly good about doing. I did write a hymn harmonization on Sunday, though, which I suppose is a good thing! I think that now is a great time to begin putting explicit time markers on my life. I know that my schedule will change when I begin to teach again next semester, but the first of those is at 11 AM, so in theory I can schedule anything I like before then. It might be worth considering locales as well.</p>
<p>For those events which happen multiple times a week, that means setting aside multiple blocks of time. For writing the song, I think that one time on Sunday makes sense, since I’ll already be doing music, and the other maybe on Wednesday. Great, they’re in at 8AM those two days, and I’ll for now plan on doing them at home.</p>
<p>For pop science, I think that Friday mornings could be a good day, and it would be nice to do them in a coffee shop. That means I need to pick one out on Thursday and print it out, since I’d like to avoid having to use my computer.<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> I’ve booked it an hour a week, starting at 8am this Friday.</p>
<p>When do I want to work on drawing? Realistically, whenever. I know that I want to do it at home, though, if only because it’s embarrassing to have others see my work. MTWR makes sense to me? I get a long weekend off of it, which would be cool. In at 7 50 am so that on Wednesdays it will not conflict with music time.</p>
<p>I have scheduled 3 to 5 pm on Sundays for reflecting on the Gospel and writing the hymn harmonization, and 4PM Saturday for prereading it.</p>
<p>That takes care of all the weekly events, so now it’s time to start scheduling the daily events! I recently got an app that asks me about my day at start and end, and I’m going to treat that as good enough for now. 715 to 725 will daily be guitar time. I haven’t quite figured out where musing is going to fit into my schedule, but I think that it might help to figure out what my days actually contain on a weekly basis first.</p>
<p>725 to 740 is booked each day for the first stretch, and the second will happen before bed. I don’t think that I want to do daily affirmations, and I’ll plan to walk to the pool daily at 1050 am, except for Wednesdays, when I’ll move it to 10 AM.<a href="#fn092" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Wow, it feels kind of nice to have the whole day scheduled out like that. I know that tomorrow we will not be able to follow the schedule exactly, because it takes me more than 20 minutes to get ready and to work, and I have to be at work at 850. Guess everything gets shifted back 15 minutes! I hope that I’ll find a way to make this routine both helpful to me and also maintainable.</p>
