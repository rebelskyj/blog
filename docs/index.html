<p>First Published: 2022 December 2</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As with my last two posts about Dungeons and Dragons, I again was playing at the same friend‚Äôs house with the same DM. This was the third session in our module, which was prewritten by WotC. I predicted one of the major plot reveals,<a href="#fn001" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> which was that the wise mentor on the island dedicated to dragons was, herself, a dragon. It‚Äôs been a fun time so far, and I‚Äôm really excited to finish out this module before starting another one. I don‚Äôt have much more to say right now, though I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll have more to say tomorrow.</p>

<h1 id="monthly-reflection"><a href="reflection-november-2022.html">Monthly Reflection</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 December 1</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>It‚Äôs the final month of 2022, which means that it‚Äôs my final monthly reflection for the year. I didn‚Äôt really set any goals in my <a href="restarting.html">first post of the year</a>, but I did mention five things I was excited for then. I‚Äôll reflect on those at the end of the year</p>
<p>My goals last month were:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Blog every day</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch every day.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a poem every day.</p></li>
<li><p>Finish NaNoWriMo successfully</p></li>
<li><p>Make progress towards catching up on BiaY</p></li>
<li><p>At least two entries in 24<span class="math inline"><sup>2</sup></span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><p>I blogged 13 times last month, which isn‚Äôt my best job ever. Hopefully this month goes better.</p></li>
<li><p>I stretched three times that I recorded, which is still progress technically.</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote a poem a day until the 22 or 23, when I abruptly stopped.</p></li>
<li><p>I <a href="nanowrimo-4.html">did it!</a></p></li>
<li><p>I‚Äôm much closer now, though still not there</p></li>
<li><p>I only added one new entry.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>That‚Äôs honestly slightly better than I normally do. I realized that I was using time I would often use for blogging for NaNoWriMo, which meant I didn‚Äôt want to blog as much. This month I‚Äôd like to write at least as much, but I guess I‚Äôll have to see if I can do better about still blogging. Stretching remains a goal of mine that feels so unapproachable for some reason. Writing a poem a day did a lot to force me to write, though in addition to the prose I was doing, I don‚Äôt know if I still need it right now. NaNoWriMo was fun, and now my brother has pointed out how easily I could output a large sum of writing. I‚Äôm behind on 24<span class="math inline"><sup>2</sup></span>, which is sad, but I guess encouragement for me to start doing things faster.</p>
<p>My goals for this month are:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Blog every day. This month is the month, I can feel it.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch every day. ibid.</p></li>
<li><p>Write another 50000 word book. I saw that it was very possible last month, so I‚Äôd like to show myself that it is again.</p></li>
<li><p>Catch up on BiaY. If I want to finish this year, I need to be caught up by the end of the month.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Time to see how I do!</p>

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Hooray! I finished NaNoWriMo yesterday, nearly a week ahead of time. Sadly, there are still two achievements which require me to continue writing these next few days, so I will continue to do so.</p>
<p><a href="nanowrimo-3.hmtl">Last time</a> I was curious if the goal would be 0 after finishing the goal, which is somewhat true, Before I had put an increase in my wordcount today, the goal was zero. After doing so, the goal was 40, which is interesting. My writing continued to go more quickly throughout the month, which was nice. I</p>

<p>At this point, I‚Äôm more and more sure that I‚Äôm the only one who reads this blog, for all that I rarely do so. In many respects, that makes this mostly a write-only space. But, I am currently listening to an audiobook about the creative process, and there are some interesting ideas in it about creativity.</p>
<p>A brief search of my musings<a href="#fn031" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> shows me that I have mentioned my muse in apparently only two posts, both of which are from my initial blog. In <a href="arranging-for-bagpipes-ii.html">one</a>, I talk about how I was blessed with a hyperfocused muse that day. In <a href="making-a-mixtape.html">the other</a>, I mention how my muse should be considered to have the name Janet that day.</p>
<p>The book talks about how writing more makes you more creative, though it does so in more of a spiritual sense than I think I am personally willing to ascribe to it. Still, it made me think about the fact that what I do now does shape who I am in the future.</p>
<p>So, to the future me, I hope that the writing I do now is helping you write better. To my muse, I hope that my willingness to keep writing will encourage you to keep giving me ideas.</p>

<p>First Published: 2022 November 24</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Last night<a href="#fn041" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I had the chance to watch a fantastic musical called ‚ÄúCome From Away.‚Äù It‚Äôs about the small Newfoundland town that suddenly nearly doubled in town on September 11, 2001 when planes were diverted to its airport. I really enjoyed the musical, because most of the music was clearly coming from the Newfoundland folk tradition, and there were certainly<a href="#fn042" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> a number of nods to that great Canadian songsmith Stan Rogers, with his driving bass and rock influences.</p>
<p>The musical was interesting, especially in the way that it interspersed the serious with the profound with the funny and lighthearted. It gave me, at least, a similar feeling to what it must have felt like to be running without sleep for days in the midst of tragedy and love.</p>
<p>The mix wasn‚Äôt the best, but that could also just be where we were sitting. It was a fantastic show!</p>

<h1 id="book-review-of-the-housekeeper-and-the-professor"><a href="book-review-housekeeper-professor-ogawa.html">Book Review of The Housekeeper and the Professor</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 November 21</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>I just finished rereading Yoko Ogawa‚Äôs <em>The Housekeeper and the Professor.</em> The book tells the story of a housekeeper assigned to a former math professor who has suffered an accident which means he cannot remember anything more than 80 minutes in the past. The professor is brilliant, in love with mathematics, and a genuinely kind person. Most of the book focuses on the relationship between the professor and the housekeeper‚Äôs son, who form a bond over their shared love for baseball.</p>
<p>Reading the book was an interesting experience for me. The last time I read this book was more than half of my life ago,<a href="#fn051" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> when my grandmother gave it to me. I don‚Äôt remember why she had the book, thought I would enjoy it, or what I took from it at the time, but throughout the entire reading of the book<a href="#fn052" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, I kept remembering vague snippets of my childhood.</p>
<p>For a book about the lack of memory someone has, it was an interesting metaexperience reflecting on my own lack of memory about my last reading of it. Even without my own personal connection to the book, though, I did really enjoy it. It‚Äôs great as a person in science seeing a writer talking about the fundamental beauty of math, and the characters all feel real. More than that, though, most all of the characters in the book are kind people. Too often I find that fiction, especially realistic fiction, tries to paint a world where no one is motivated by the interest of the common good. This book does not do that.</p>
<p>Overall, I give it a very biased score of 5/5, and would likely still give it a 4.5/5 even without my history. I‚Äôd highly recommend reading it, especially since it‚Äôs so short.</p>

<p>Luke 23:37 ‚Äúthey called out, ‚ÄòIf you are King of the Jews, save yourself.‚Äô‚Äù</p>

<p>The liturgical year‚Äôs last Sunday is always the Solemnity of Christ the King of the Universe. In 2018, I noted that the year was the Year of Grace, though I don‚Äôt know what the year is this time.</p>
<p>Something I found really powerful about the readings is how they connect to each other and to Christ‚Äôs Kingship. The first reading shows us David‚Äôs entry into kingship, which is the line through which Christ claims His. The second reminds us that everything was created through Christ for Christ.</p>
<p>And, the Gospel serves to remind us what the King‚Äôs role is. He is not some warlord, conquering nations under a sword. Rather, he dies on behalf of those who revile and spite him.</p>

<h1 id="reflections-on-todays-gospel"><a href="reflections-on-readings-33-ordinary-c-22.html">Reflections on Today‚Äôs Gospel</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 November 13</p>
<p>2 Thessalonians 3:10 ‚ÄúIn fact, when we were with you, we instructed you that if anyone was unwilling to work, neither should that one eat.‚Äù</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As a brief preface, I really only focus on the Second Reading today, and in particular a single verse from it. That verse pertains to the nature of work in the Catholic worldview.</p>
<p>A question that I‚Äôve had for a while is what the Church teaches about intellectual property. So far as I can tell, it doesn‚Äôt really have any teachings. The Church does, however, have a number of teachings on physical property.</p>
<p>One of these is that St. Paul‚Äôs exhortation requiring people to be willing to work comes with it the duty to give them what they need to work. I, personally, take that to mean that intellectual property also belongs generally to the public. Of course, the Church strongly states that we have a right to individual property, not just public use. The defense of copyright from that perspective is that we have a right to the profit potential of an idea.</p>
<p>For many reasons, that strikes me as a hollow argument. After all, most of the profit coming from ideas is not from individuals, but from corporations. Corporations preventing other corporations from using an idea they‚Äôve created is something I don‚Äôt have strong feelings about, but I do strongly believe that an individual working for their own benefit should be able to use whatever tools they can that do not harm another. That is, since sharing information does not take it from the sharer, there is no legitimate cause, in my mind, for people to have the right to hoard knowledge. Additionally, is the right to profit really a right at all?</p>
<p>I am reminded of a quote from <a href="https://incommunion.org/2010/11/24/the-social-doctrine-of-st-basil-the-great/">Saint Basil the Great</a>, ‚ÄúThe one who steals clothes off someone‚Äôs back is called a thief. Why should we refer to the one who does not clothe the naked, while having the means to do so, as anything else? The bread that you have belongs to the hungry, the clothes that are in your cupboard belong to the naked, the shoes that are rotting in your possession belong to the barefooted, the money that you have buried belongs to the destitute. And so you commit injustice to so many when you could have helped them.‚Äù Just as we would say that you should not forcibly take bread from someone with much to give to one who is little, but the one with much is in the wrong, we should not take the intellectual property from one who has it to give to one who does not. But, that‚Äôs the great thing about information. It isn‚Äôt taken when it‚Äôs shared.</p>
<p>I have two more points about St. Paul‚Äôs quote. The first is that he does not say that people who do not work should not eat, only that if someone is unwilling to work. Too often, society takes the assumption that anyone not working must not want to work. However, doing work that is not fulfilling to you or beneficial to the community is not work that we are called to do. One unwilling to do this meaningless work should not be punished, at least in my reading of the text.</p>
<p>Finally, just after Paul tells us this, he reminds us that paying attention to the doings of others is also not Christian. That is, he does not say that we should not feed the person who does not work, but that they should not eat. He then makes it very clear that it is not our place to decide who is and is not willing to work.</p>

<p>First Published: 2022 November 8</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Yesterday was my grandmother‚Äôs birthday. It‚Äôs a strange day for me, because it is a little sad. I still miss her, if only intellectually.</p>
<p>On the other hand, though, I can no longer remember most of what used to make me sad about her absence, let alone her. The only pieces of her voice that I can recall are from the voicemail that my dear brother had<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> for the longest time. When I try to picture her face, I can only see the photographs of her that we keep in our home.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs strange for me to realize that I‚Äôve been without grandparents for nearly half my life now. A lot of the poems I‚Äôve been writing this month have centered around memory, especially the generational memory that I feel like I‚Äôm missing.<a href="#fn082" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> In retrospect, November is a month that always has so many calls to my past, so it‚Äôs unsurprising that my reflection<a href="#fn083" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> would start centering on them.</p>
<p>So what is remembering? Is it the emotional ties that we keep to what‚Äôs now gone? Is it the intellectual knowledge of something now lost? Is it something else? I don‚Äôt really know, but I‚Äôm glad I at least had this to reflect on it for a bit.</p>

<p>First Published: 2022 November 7</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>It‚Äôs officially one week into NaNoWriMo<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, and I‚Äôm currently doing well. I‚Äôve managed to write at least my word goal every day, and I‚Äôm almost a full day ahead now. Since the last time I attempted it<a href="#fn092" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, the website has changed a lot. It‚Äôs much more user friendly now, and it‚Äôs far more gamified as well.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs even an achievement for hitting par<a href="#fn093" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> every day in the month, which has been my primary motivating factor. One thing I have noticed, though, is that the daily goal appears to update based on how many words you have left to 50000. I wonder if that means it‚Äôll set itself to 0 when I surpass the goal.<a href="#fn094" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
