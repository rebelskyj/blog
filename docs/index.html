<h1 id="draft-2-12-november-2025">Draft 2: 12 November 2025</h1>
<p>It is not a year since she died.</p>
<p>It is not a year since I sat shiva.</p>
<p>To my surprise, it is a year since I brought back this blog.</p>
<p>My last post before the reflection on Music was in July. I know that I went home to see my mother the weekend before Labor Day. She felt ill again, and went to the hospital; internally I joked that I was a bad omen, since coming home had sent her to the hospital twice in a row.</p>
<p>She was much more ill than we had thought again.</p>
<p>The doctors didn’t know if she would make it again.</p>
<p>This time she didn’t make it.</p>
<p>One year ago today I reflected on a few memories with music I have of her.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, I introduced the idea of a weekly album club to the remaining members of my family. Despite the fact that we’re the entire Rebelsky family now, we do not use the chat we used to<a href="#fn001" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>I can’t believe that it was the twenty fourth that we did that.</p>
<p>I remember when I was in middle school choir. My mother mentioned that she could hear me singing, and refused to see why that wasn’t a good thing.</p>
<p>In the past year, I have not written here anywhere near as much as I would have liked. In the year coming, I hope that I will write closer to as much as I like. It’s been a year since the first post I made since my mother left my home for the last time.</p>
<p>What will this next year bring?</p>
<p>One of my new work friends recently asked me if I have any new year’s resolutions incoming. Honestly, I have forgotten that time exists. I mentioned my previous, and likely abandoned, tradition of N for N.</p>
<p>My mother would not want that.</p>
<p>So, I figure that this is as good a place as any. In the next year, I will grow. I will become more of the person my mother would want me to be.<a href="#fn002" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>I’m an hour past when I should be asleep, and what better time is there to finish writing, tears drying on my cheek as my shoulders still shake from half-repressed shudders of sorrow and grief?</p>
<p>My mother was a poet.</p>
<p>I wish I was too</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-12-november-2025">Draft 1: 12 November 2025</h1>
<p>There are countless experiences that we are unable to express in words. Most of the time, we think of these experiences as the incredible, the awesome, the sublime. Sometimes, however, it’s the complete absence of difference that becomes notable.</p>
<p>Today I read through most of “On the Calculation of Volume”<a href="#fn003" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, which is a piece of literary fiction about someone stuck in a time loop. Something about that is really resonating with me right now. There are words for time passing by too quickly, there are ways to express time when it drags like a sullen child. There do not seem to be, however, words for the way that time is when it doesn’t seem to exist.</p>
<p>I’m sure that my emotions must have changed from this time last year. We’re a year from the day of the first post I made in a world without my mother. How has it been so long?</p>
<p>How has it been so short?</p>
<p>How long can I make my posts about my mother before people will want me to move on? What does it mean to move on?</p>
<p>I’m terrified to read my father’s blog, because I know that he’s in a similar place. They say it’s good to face one’s fears; let’s see what he had to say recently. Wow there’s a special kind of sorrow in the dramatic irony of a post in time.</p>
<p>In 2017, my father wrote <a href="https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/musings/thirty-years">“I hope we have at least another thirty years together”</a>.</p>
<p>Last year, I somehow missed my father <a href="https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/musings/halloween-2024-10-31">thinking about Halloween with my mother</a>. Maybe it’s good for me to do this writing and reading now and here.</p>
<p>I don’t think that I’ve cried in a few months. As I just read <a href="https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/musings/nine-months-michelle">my father’s three quarter year reflection</a>, however, tears began spilling down my face. These emotions are definitely not new<a href="#fn004" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref4"><sup>4</sup></a>, but I don’t think that I’ve let them be. Maybe that’s for the best.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/musings/anniversary-2025">letter he wrote for their anniversary this year</a> is somehow even more painful. When I was listening to Not Dead Yet, I was driving towards my final outreach talk as a graduate student. I had to pull over for a moment, the grief was so intense.<a href="#fn005" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>At a little over <a href="https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/musings/eleven-months-michelle">eleven months</a>, my father apparently came to terms with my mom’s absence. I absolutely have not yet; I still immediately think of her when I need to ask a question about medicine or have a thing to share about our Catholic faith.<a href="#fn006" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref6"><sup>6</sup></a> I do so strongly relate to my dad’s comment that it’s sad no longer being able to have the excitement that comes from knowing I’m going to get to share something with her. He mentions my Ph.D. defense there.</p>
<p>That’s such a hard thing for me to think about. That day, while we celebrated, one of the older members of the (astronomy) department came to ask my advisor what was happening. I don’t know quite why, but she shared that my mom had passed. The prof nodded, walked away. He came back later and congratulated my father.</p>
<p>I’m sure there’s something there, but the emotions have taken any possible story out of it.</p>
<p>“I was depressed, but not sad.” my dad writes in the eleven month reflection.</p>
<p>There’s something almost unfair about the way that depression and grief hit me so differently.</p>
<p>He reflects on the journeys they never got to take together. Like my father, I too mostly enjoy trips for the people I can share them with. I don’t know if my mother would have wanted to take a train trip, but I feel certain that she would have wanted me to travel after my defense.</p>
<p>It’s so sad to realize that a year has come and gone and I did my best to ignore it.</p>
<p>And fuck,<a href="#fn007" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref7"><sup>7</sup></a> here’s <a href="https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/musings/one-year-michelle">One year.</a></p>
<p>My father reflected on how his mother turned to the faith of her Fathers<a href="#fn008" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref8"><sup>8</sup></a> when her husband passed. Even though she, too, is now gone, my father was able to connect with her in finding faith in the midst of grief.</p>
<p>I wish I was as brave and strong as my father. I cannot handle the idea of sobbing daily, even if that’s the way I feel.  The fact that he can let himself feel that is something I don’t have words for.<a href="#fn009" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Also, sometimes I forget just how powerful of a writer my father can be.</p>
<p>“I typically assumed that things generally work out okay in the end.<br />
I guess I was wrong.”</p>
<p>The line break.</p>
<p>There’s something powerful in the fact that my first post after her death was about music, and <a href="https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/musings/surviving-concert-2025-10-19">my father recently posted about a concert without her</a>. The artist is one of the many that I’m named after.</p>
<p><a href="https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/musings/thirteen-months-michelle">And this brings us to the thirteen month</a>. I’m nearly positive that my maternal grandmother died on a Friday the Thirteenth. Something about that is so fitting, as she was always the most superstitious of those I knew.<a href="#fn0010" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>It feels almost like a betrayal to not do Thanksgiving at home this year. I know that we had many conversations about how little the traditions of Thanksgiving meant to any of us. Still, last year I felt connected to her as I made the one “family recipe” she insisted on every year: butter mushrooms.<a href="#fn0011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref11"><sup>11</sup></a> This year, there’s none of her.</p>
<p>I don’t know what making bagels this year will be like.</p>
<p>Last year I didn’t have her, but the wound was fresh. Every year before, I had her to come down and make conversation. In years where there would others, she would chide me for not offering coffee.<a href="#fn0012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref12"><sup>12</sup></a> In years without them, she’d just sit with me and talk for a while.</p>
<p>“, look, here’s yet another form we had to have her sign. She could barely write her own name at that point”.</p>
<p>There is something so incredibly painful in remembering the way that she slowly faded away.</p>
<p>Her own mother went to the hospital on a Monday, sorted her affairs, and left the hospital on Friday. I think that my mom had wanted to go out like that.</p>
<p>Then again, she also said that she wasn’t ready to die just before I stop remember her being lucid. I still don’t know what the last words she said to me were, nor do I know what the last words she heard me say were. I remember waking up to my brother knocking on my door. I remember walking to the hospital, passing by the same person at the entry desk. Unlike every other time, I don’t think that she waved to us.</p>
<p>I remember standing beside her bed.</p>
<p>Or, I remember standing beside the bed I knew was no longer hers.</p>
<p>None of us had the words. We had the need to pray, however. I was the only one with the words of a prayer, and so we did the “Lux perpetua”, the one prayer I still find myself praying regularly.<a href="#fn0013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>The next days are a blur.</p>
<p>I didn’t realize that my dad had taken down my mom’s medical texts. Those books sat in an unreachable part of our home for my entire life. I guess that it makes sense we should get rid of them; many probably would find homes where they could be of use.</p>
<p>My dad thinks that we won’t associate any given book with him. I think that’s probably true, but I do also have the firm suspicion that there will be books I cannot separate from him in my mind. War for the Oaks I think will always be a book from my mother in my mind. Love and Knishes is a book from my dad’s mother. I didn’t think of these facts until recently forced to think of death, though, so who can say.</p>
<p>I truly hope that I don’t have to find an answer to that question for a long while yet.</p>
<p>OOf ok so here we go. Time to make a coherent final draft.</p>
<h1 id="draft-.8-12-november-2025">Draft .8: 12 November 2025</h1>
<p>I’ll be totally honest here:<a href="#fn0014" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref14"><sup>14</sup></a> I have found that almost seven hundred words in to this, two full drafts later, I still don’t know what this musing will be about. I guess that there is something in the fact that mentally I always think of these creations as musings (per my father) or blogs (per the fact that they’re on the internet). Let’s take a minute<a href="#fn0015" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref15"><sup>15</sup></a> and look at why I decided to call it a folly.</p>
<p>Weirdly, I didn’t make that choice until <a href="verbiage.html">this year</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of the time of the year, perhaps because of the music I’m listening to, and perhaps because I just looked through the history of my posts here, but I find myself not quite sad, but certainly in a tearful emotion. It’s so strange to think about the way that I started 2024, completely unaware of the fact that I would end it in grief. Looking at <a href="reflection-2023.html">my reflection at the start of the year</a>, I barely mention my family at all. I knew that my mom was dying of cancer; somehow that didn’t make me decide to think about her.</p>
<p>Anyways, I want to look forward, I think? I think that this whole post might end up being posted as random musings, because I don’t know what to say here. That’s probably as good as it’ll get.</p>
<h1 id="draft-0.5-12-november-2025">Draft 0.5: 12 November 2025</h1>
<p>I often have trouble creating and maintaining routine. And, of course, I have the normal issue of wanting to fix every issue in my life at once, rather than as they come up. With that in mind, I’m going to try to start accepting that each week is about creating a new good habit or removing an old bad habit. Given that it’s working right now, I’m going to call this week’s habit “get up earlier”.</p>
<p>Every time in my life that I can consistently wake well before I’m needed somewhere, I adore it. So, then, why do I not keep it up? Because entropy is always the secret winner.</p>
<p>One morning will come, I’ll be incredibly tired from some event the night before, and so I will sleep in a little longer. After all, the habit should serve me, not the other way around. Then, more awake than I’m used to at night, I stay up late again. I sleep in again, and I’m suddenly waking just in time again.</p>
<p>So, how has resetting my sleep been going? Honestly, really well. The alarm has been set for half five since Monday.</p>
<p>Monday I slept again until 610. Tuesday I lay in bed until 550, despite having initially awoken a little before the alarm. Today I woke before the alarm again, and then started reading at 530. From there, I realized that I wanted to write, and so here I am.</p>
<p>In comparison to <a href="flection-november-25">my previous flection about the month</a>, there is a lot missing from this morning. I am not working on Celtic knotwork in the morning any of these days.<a href="#fn0016" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref16"><sup>16</sup></a> I have made exactly zero progress with the different pieces I’m working on in regards to composition.<a href="#fn0017" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>See footnote.</p>
<h1 id="draft-0-11-november-2025">Draft 0: 11 November 2025</h1>
<p>This morning I woke up to find that it had snowed while I was sleeping. The snow, as it always is, was beautiful. The snow, as often happens to early snowfall, is gone now.</p>
<p>I’m realizing now that part of what’s kept me from understanding the passage of time this year is the fact that the weather has not followed the passage of time. It was in the fifties last week.<a href="#fn0018" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Anyways, I’m not entirely sure what’s going to come out of today’s writing.</p>
<p>I’ve recently been reading more than before, and this evening I learned how to play bridge. I’ve also been working on an idea for a dear friend’s present, but I’m now wondering if it might not be best made in a medium other than embroidery.<a href="#fn0019" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref19"><sup>19</sup></a> After nearly two hours of banging my head against a wall, I finally found the reason that I could not get my knots to line up. That’s nice and all, but it does leave a sour taste in my mouth.</p>
<p>Because I stayed late to play bridge, it’s already my bed time, and that’s something that I want to make real efforts towards respecting. So, I guess not every day ends up being a worthwhile post?</p>
<p>Hmmm, that’s not satisfying as a thing to post, though. Guess this will wait for tomorrow, when I can give more time to thinking about the framing for this?</p>

<h1 id="monthly-flection"><a href="flection-november-25.html">Monthly Flection</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2025 November 10</p>
<h1 id="draft-3-10-november-2025">Draft 3: 10 November 2025</h1>
<p>I didn’t love quite how messy the last draft was in the context of this nominally being a flection.<a href="#fn011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> With that in mind, let’s think about this month. My main goals are to become a functional adult.</p>
<p>August taught me to finish my degree. September taught me to stop being a grad student. October taught me to be a salary man. Now November lets me become my best self.</p>
<p>In general, the big goals I have for the month are a clean home and a song for the upcoming wedding. Next highest priority is the pattern and starting on the embroidery project, along with writing here. Following that, we have a decent sleep schedule and reading the<a href="#fn012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> library books I checked out.</p>
<p>November is often a tough month, but here’s hoping this one isn’t.</p>
<h1 id="draft-2-10-november-2025">Draft 2: 10 November 2025</h1>
<p>Well, I missed the chance to post this as a true proflection, and so instead we have a flection. Month is not quite over, but we’re about half way through it. So, what do I want to make of the month?</p>
<p>I really do want to write here more. I don’t entirely know what the barrier is<a href="#fn013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Unlike the previous draft, though, I’m not as interested here in exploring exactly how much time I can and will allocate to different tasks. Instead, I hope to use this as a way of figuring out what’s important to me right now, and what I can and should be trying to push myself towards.</p>
<p>Clean home. Yesterday a friend expressed that they want to see my home before they finish graduate school. That should be a completely reasonable request, and so one goal I have is to have a home which is clean enough that I can have others visit.<a href="#fn014" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref4"><sup>4</sup></a> More than that, I like knowing where things are, I like having a home that doesn’t cause me visual or mental pain when I look at it. I just recently got a new shelving unit, and I do really truly believe that the biggest issue I had was a lack of storage space. Of course, if I had too little storage space, that does also imply that I have too much stuff. Nevertheless.</p>
<p>Exercise. I recently signed up for a pilates gym. Both to get use out of my spending and because exercise is good for me, I want to go to that more. I like Pilates because it’s done laying down a lot of the time. For whatever reason, the workout feels much better when I don’t have to be standing or sitting up.</p>
<p>Music. I don’t entirely know what I’m thinking here, but I guess there is a very limited amount of time left to write the piece for a friend’s wedding. I should probably start that tomorrow.<a href="#fn015" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Outside of that, I’ve been listening to a lot of music, and would like to keep doing that.</p>
<p>Celtic Knotwork. As I was thinking about how busy I feel despite having objectively more free time, I thought about how, while visiting college friends during my train trip, some of them asked if I was still drawing Celtic knots. They’re certainly an activity that i can do for ages, as evidenced by my constantly getting lost in them. However, a dear friend is also graduating soon, and so I would like to make an embroidered piece for them. This requires crafting a pattern first, which right now means both drawing out the knot and figuring out a way to have breaks that I like.<a href="#fn016" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Reading. I have checked out a number of books from the local library, and so I would very much like to read them so I can return them. That’s something that leads well into the next point.</p>
<p>Less screen time. I don’t like staring at my screen. I particularly don’t like staring at my screen and feeling like I have nothing going on in it. Reading is fun, and so is experiencing<a href="#fn017" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref7"><sup>7</sup></a> the world around me.</p>
<p>There are countless other things, but now let’s play the role of devil’s advocate.</p>
<p>In order for me to do more things, I have to give up others.</p>
<p>I want to spend more time with friends, and that’s time that I can’t be writing here.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Writing.</p>
<p>I realize that right now, my web novel feels less like something I want to do and more and more like a weight around my neck. I’ve had some ideas for more things I could write, but have felt like I can’t write them because I should instead be writing this web novel. Given that it’s something that I am doing entirely for fun, that’s nonsense. I can and should write other things.</p>
<p>In particular, I want to try some flash fiction, poetry again, and ideally some sort of novel thing.</p>
<p>I want to sleep better.</p>
<p>Anyways, rather than continuing to make a wishlist, let’s think about ways to make the schedule more doable for me.</p>
<p>First, I’ve learned that there is no point to me getting to work before about 710. I really enjoy starting my morning with a pastry, and they don’t get put out until then.<a href="#fn018" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Since the Pilates morning class takes place at 6am, I need to be awake in time to reach that. It’s generally better, so I’m told, to have a self-similar sleep schedule. With that in mind, waking at half five feels like the new goal.</p>
<p>On days without Pilates<a href="#fn019" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref9"><sup>9</sup></a>, that leaves me with an hour and change before I can go to work. That time is easily and well spent cleaning, reading, writing, or drawing. Realistically, I think that it’s probably best spent cleaning or reading because the drawing, embroidering, and writing can all suck my mind into them.</p>
<p>On days with Pilates, that’s obviously not going to happen. However, getting my body moving during what’s<a href="#fn0110" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref10"><sup>10</sup></a> going to be a cold winter is definitely worth more than that.</p>
<p>As a consequence of getting to work earlier, I can then leave work earlier. That means that I have the time when others might be commuting home to instead work on the things which are important to me, such as writing this here site. Before bed is a great time for analog activities, such as embroidery and reading, or writing by hand, which is something that I’m enjoying.</p>
<p>What is standing in my way of getting my life on track like this?</p>
<p>I am eepy in the morning.<a href="#fn0111" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref11"><sup>11</sup></a> This both makes it hard to get up and makes me feel less well rested. Solution: going to bed earlier doesn’t really seem to help, because then I just wake up more in the night. I’m hoping that moving my electronics back out of the bedroom at night might help, and at worst may consider investing in an alarm clock that I keep outside of arm’s reach.</p>
<p>I’m weary when I come home from work. If I schedule meditation time right away, or some other activity that gives me energy, then that’s not as much of a problem, at least as I’m seeing right now.</p>
<p>I don’t entirely know what a clean home means. That’s probably not true, but it’s a convenient fiction for myself, right now at least. Realistically, I only need my home to be clean to the point that others will see it. Is that doable? Maybe.</p>
<p>I don’t know what to write. I think that might actually be one of the barriers, but realistically that’s nonsense. I’ve never once typed more than a hundred words and not had more to write.<a href="#fn0112" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>It’s easier to not do things than to do them. Steam games are really easy. For now, I think that does mean that I should uninstall steam and all its games from my computer. That is no longer an easy thing to do. I will, once the embroidery pattern is made, leave the embroidery out. That will also make it easier to do.</p>
<p>Part of me is considering leaving the writing site I use open as a rule when I close my computer. That will certainly make it easier to use, but the only question is if I’ll then just start getting rid of it immediately. Who can say?</p>
<p>Anyways, since spending time with friends is important to me, I’m off to do that.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-2-november-2025-working-title-monthly-proflection">Draft 1: 2 November 2025 (working title: Monthly Proflection)</h1>
<p>Unlike most months, where my first post of the month is a reflection on the previous month, I figure that this month might better serve me as a forward facing. That is, rather than reflect where I was, I want to proflect<a href="#fn0113" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref13"><sup>13</sup></a> on where I want to be at the next reflection. Light takes time to travel between a mirror and my eyes, and my own goals can too.</p>
<p>So, what all feels meaningful to me when I think on the month?</p>
<p>This month I want to be better about writing. I have spent this past weekend unsure of how I feel, other than bad. In large part, that was only possible because I let myself get away from writing. Where can I make time for writing in the every day?</p>
<p>There are twenty four hours in a day.</p>
<p>I need to sleep at least eight. There are sixteen hours in each day.</p>
<p>In general, I’m told I should be working at least nine. That leaves seven hours.</p>
<p>If I drive to work, it’s about a ninety minute round trip, leaving five and a half. If I bus, instead, it’s about three total hours, but I do also get about two hours of reading time, leaving fourish.</p>
<p>I want to start doing cardio every day. Given that I should not do cardio just before bed<a href="#fn0114" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref14"><sup>14</sup></a>, that probably means that it’s a right after work activity. If I say half an hour for that, that leaves me with five or three and a half.</p>
<p>Reading is important to me, and I’d like to spend at least an hour a day reading. That is, five or still three and a half.</p>
<p>What else do I want to do?</p>
<p>This month I want to find what the minimal amount of clutter or mess or chaos is sustainable in my own home. I have every faith that it’s much cleaner than I currently think, even if I don’t entirely know where, exactly, the line is.</p>
<p>I want to ask myself what things that I own do I actually want to keep. There are a lot of things in my home which I have solely because it feels somehow wrong to dispose of them. That is far from a good reason to keep a cord for a device I no longer own, and so I’m hoping to start spending time thinking about that.</p>
<p>I want to do NaNoWriMo, even if I’m not going to participate in the official version or even necessarily write a novel. I do, in theory, at least, want to get back into the web novel, and this is a good month to start doing the writing for it.<a href="#fn0115" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Otherwise, I want to be hand writing in my journal, and I want to be doing these sorts of things on my site.</p>
<p>If I leave for the day at 645, I can get to work by 710 or so. If I want to spend twenty minutes doing hand writing before that, I need to start writing by 625. Since it takes me at least tenish minutes to get ready, that means that I should try setting my alarm for six fifteen tonight. It’s not quite 2100, and I did take a nap this afternoon, so that should be more than doable.</p>
<p>There is a big voice in my own head that thinks that I spend too much time in bed. That is, I think that if I gave myself less time to sleep, I would potentially not only sleep better, but feel more rested upon waking. Whether or not that’s true, it is something I want to try to explore this month.</p>
<p>I’ve also just today finished<a href="#fn0116" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref16"><sup>16</sup></a> a book about how to organize my life given my neurotype.<a href="#fn0117" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref17"><sup>17</sup></a> What I took from the book is that I should not be afraid to ask for help and that if there are services which can take care of tasks for me, I should follow through on doing them. Right now I feel like I’m generally eating ok, so probably not going to do grocery deliveries.</p>
<p>I don’t like the idea of a stranger in my home, so for now at least I’m going to try to have my home organized. I do think that part of the issue is a lack of storage, and so I have made steps towards fixing that. I do also need to get rid of possessions, which November is a great month for.</p>
<p>Eight hundred words later, I think that this is a good place to call it for the night. Time to prep a space for me to write tomorrow morning, and then hopefully force myself into the task!</p>

<h1 id="one-year"><a href="one-year.html">One Year</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2025 October 8</p>
<p>Content warning: horribly sad.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>It’s been one year.</p>
<p>What am I supposed to do with that?</p>
<p>I miss you.</p>
<p>I’m sad that you couldn’t be there to watch me graduate.</p>
<p>I’m sad that I can’t talk to you about my first few days at work. You would have laughed at how I forgot what meaningful use is.</p>
<p>The sunset on the lake was beautiful tonight; I’m sorry that you never got to sit on the dock and watch it like you wanted.</p>
<p>I’ve been generally doing well; I don’t tear up when the fact that you died comes up any more.</p>
<p>I’m not doing well right now; tears are flowing.</p>
<p>There’s a poem and accompanying textpost on tumblr about the way that men love. One that stuck out to me was the man who became a cobbler because his own mother was buried without shoes.</p>
<p>I am not an oncologist, and I could never be one; watching even one mother die like you did would break me forever. I will work with oncology; even though better charting wouldn’t have saved you, it still feels like what I can do.</p>
<p>It’s been one year.</p>
<p>It feels like it’s been forever.</p>
<p>It feels like yesterday.</p>
<p>It’s been one year. One fucking year.<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>So much still hurts. I don’t use purple or pink any more. I can’t listen to the Bible or Catechism in a Year; that was supposed to be something we did together. I can’t write my web novel; that was what you said helped during chemo.</p>
<p>The death certificate says that it’s been a year. Of course, the death certificate is right; the world exists as the bureaucracy says and no other way. Even though it’s been a year, it’s been more than a year since the last time you held me. It’s been more than a year since the last words you spoke.</p>
<p>I want to think that the last thing you heard me say was “I love you”. For my sake, I hope that I got to say goodbye, even if I only meant for the night.</p>
<p>I think that part of me will always be stuck in bed, waking up to the sound of my brother knocking on my door. Even without him saying anything, I knew.</p>
<p>Part of me will always be stuck at the side of your deathbed, saying the Lux Aeterna, since I was the only one who had a prayer ready.</p>
<p>Part of me will be at your deathbed before you died, when you said that you didn’t care about the funerary arrangements except that you wanted them to be Catholic. I haven’t been able to sing City of God in almost a year.</p>
<p>It’s been a year.</p>
<p>One friend who you never got to meet texted me today. I think you would have loved her.</p>
<p>It’s been a year.</p>
<p>I didn’t do as you asked; I graduated before [].<a href="#fn022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> I hope that you wouldn’t be mad at me. It sucks so much that not only did I have a graduation that felt rushed, not only did I have to do it without you, but all the while I was doing it I knew deep in my heart and keenly in my mind that I was disobeying your last wishes.</p>
<p>Part of me is mad.</p>
<p>You gave me a task related to both of my brothers. I don’t think that you gave them one related to me.</p>
<p>It’s been a year.</p>
<p>I haven’t had these great wracking sobs in months. I almost forgot what it felt like to have tears leaking down my face as each breath catches, regardless of what else is going on.</p>
<p>It’s been a year.</p>
<p>I haven’t had anyone message me or stop me in the street to say how much you meant to them in what feels like a decade; rationally I know it can’t have been more than seven months.</p>
<p>It’s been a year.</p>
<p>You told us not to stay at your bedside day in and day out. Does it make me a bad son to have listened?</p>
<p>I look at the last photos we took as a family, and I hardly recognize you. When the friend asked me if I remembered your face, I could only think of the photo you used for everything; I think that it was at least fifteen years old by the time that you retired it.</p>
<p>At the wake, I had to walk away and sit alone. Despite everyone knowing that I was doing that to be alone, I still had a number of people stop in. I scrolled through my voice messages, knowing that I had never deleted any.</p>
<p>It took five years of scrolling to find one from you.</p>
<p>I guess that I’m glad I always picked up.</p>
<p>I’m sad that, in the over a year we had planning for your death, I never had you send me a message simply saying “I love you”.</p>
<p>It’s been a year.</p>
<p>The weekend I came back to Madison, or at least what feels like it, I went to a club with a friend for her birthday. While waiting outside the bathroom for a friend, I met another mother dying of cancer; she had no idea how to tell her children. I was able to tell her that I appreciated everything you did for us, and that I made it through.</p>
<p>It’s been a year, and yet part of me still feels like I should have covered mirrors. It feels wrong to realize that I wore a white shirt today of all days. Today was too beautiful of a day to be a reminder that you’re gone forever.</p>
<p>Today was far too lacking in beauty to be a reminder of the day your pain stopped.</p>
<p>It’s been a year.</p>
<p>Anything else I have to say belongs to you, and you alone.</p>
<p>It’s been a year.</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>Goodbye again.</p>
<p>Goodbye forever.</p>
<p>It’s been a year.</p>
<p>How do I still have smiles inside of me?</p>
<p>How do I tell the people around me that the reason I don’t mention you when talking about what my family does isn’t estrangement? I guess it’s the most permanent form of estrangement, so I suppose they understand.</p>
<p>It’s been a year.</p>
<p>maybe if I say that one more time, or one time more, it will tell my heart that it can heal.</p>
<p>it’s been a year</p>
<p>three hundred and sixty five days</p>
<p>thirteen moons, I think.</p>
<p>one year</p>

<h1 id="review-of-musicking"><a href="book-review-musicking.html">Review of Musicking</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2025 October 6</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-6-october-2025">Draft 1: 6 October 2025</h1>
<p>I am not irregularly asked what my favorite book is. There are any number of ways to answer it. I tend to lean on one of a few answers: the books I can read the most often, the books I have read the most, the books that have most inspired me, the books that most changed the way I move through the world, the books that I think will most impress the asker. It is the penultimate of these which concerns Christopher Small’s <em>Musicking</em>.</p>
<p>I’ve written here before about the semester I spent on an independent study focused on what it means to listen to music. I was assigned any number of readings and listenings, and many of them were great. The one that changed me most, however, was an article by Small also called Musicking. My biggest takeaway from that article was that anyone involved in the creation of music, down to the person selling tickets at the window or the movers who put the piano on stage, is a musician.</p>
<p>The book takes a similar, if more in depth<a href="#fn031" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> look at the question: what is music?</p>
<p>Small’s major argument is that music is not a noun, it is a verb. Musicking is the act we do, which is full of the different relationships we have to each other, the repertoire, and so on. This book also makes clear just how strange the modern orchestral concert is in the grand scheme of the world. Small takes aim at Platonism, pointing out the ridiculousness of an abstract perfect form. His take on music is best summed up on page 218: “just as there is no such thing as music, neither is there such a thing as beauty.” That is, although things can be beautiful, beauty is not a thing which exists independent of the experience. Likewise, music exists solely as performance and interrelation.</p>
<p>While reading the book, I was reminded of just how much I truly am unlearned in musical literature. I had vague notions of many of the points he hit about masculine and feminine subjects, semiotics, and the like. However, I would not have anywhere near the ability to write about the subjects<a href="#fn032" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> that he treated as mere set dressing.</p>
<p>Also in the book were some beautiful lines and thought provoking ideas. I have scattered notes, which I’m tempted to present as is<a href="#fn033" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. I’m also tempted to simply say “read it yourself”. I’ll take a middle ground, however, and point to some portions I found particularly moving or thought provoking.</p>
<p>One of the chief points Small comes back to again and again is the idea of ritual. All music, he argues, has ritual significance. The ritual of listening to a walkman<a href="#fn034" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref4"><sup>4</sup></a>, though different than the ritual of going to a theatre, is still one in itself. Similarly, there is an argument that the modern orchestral hall is sacred in the classic meaning of the word; it cannot be used for the day to day practical, and is only useful for its dedicated purpose.</p>
<p>Small, like I love to, attacks equal temperament briefly. Equal temperament is mathematical and abstract, completely divorced from what a human would naturally come to, much like modern society. I tend to dislike equal temperament for how it makes each key the same, which is part of his argument as well. It’s only a short portion of the book, almost an aside.</p>
<p>At least twice he brings up the fact that no pre-modern music was written with the idea that we would listen to it again and again. Orchestras were by and large written to be performed at a specific event, and then never again. Even those which were composed for replaying require an orchestra. Before modern recording technology, that put a hard limit on the number of times we could listen to Eroica.</p>
<p>Finally, I’d like to list a few quotations that for whatever reason I felt compelled to stop and write down. There are some quotes I said “find on page X”, but those are clearly less powerful to me.</p>
<p>124: “Those who talk of delayed gratification ought to be made to sit through all of the <em>Terminator</em> movies, followed perhaps by the <em>Die Hard</em> series. No delayed gratification there either; they grip, as they are meant to grip, from the first frame.” This quote comes from a section about how the development of the Western canon is about delaying gratification more and more.</p>
<p>197: “relationships between performers and listeners may be close, intimate, and even loving, as when the lover or the suitor sings or plays to the beloved or the sought.” I don’t know what about this quote struck me so hard, but something in it is just so beautiful to me that I cannot but rewrite it. I think it might be the repetition of love in loving, lover beloved?</p>
<p>202: “like all wind instruments it is animated into life by the breath from his body, the most intimate relationship one can have with a musical instrument”. I disagreed with this take, because I find that something like a cello can be more intimate, even if I cannot express quite why. Something about holding it and embracing, maybe?</p>
<p>also 202: “Simple it may be in its construction, but primitive it is not”. This, like the above quote, is about a hand-carved flute. He points out that the modern conveniences like slides and valves make playing far easier. That’s such a great point, and I am honestly kind of surprised that he didn’t tie in the whole “because the shepherd can make more microadjustments, his music is more free”,<a href="#fn035" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref5"><sup>5</sup></a> or something about the constraints the modern instrument cause for the modern composer.</p>
<p>212: “in my opinion any music teacher caught ... using the epithet tone-deaf of a pupil should be sacked on the spot.” I too agree that there are few who are tone deaf, and that the teacher should serve as an encourager, not a discourager.</p>
<p>213: “all musicking is ultimately a political act”. It’s important to remember that everything is political. By definition, the relationships we create have political meaning.</p>
<p>220: John Cage used to respond to interview questions he didn’t like “I don’t find that a very interesting question”. There’s a kind of power in that.</p>
<p>Also, Mozart apparently stopped practicing at the age of 7, because his day to day music work was enough for him to stay in musical shape.</p>
<p>All in all, this book was incredibly fun to read, powerful, and relatively easy, though very deep. I would highly recommend that others read it, and I have every intention of reading it again.</p>
<h1 id="draft-0-17-september-2025">Draft 0: 17 September 2025</h1>
<p>Before I start this review, I just have to say that it is wild to me how much books from the late nineteen hundreds feel both like they just happened and happened centuries ago. Small, for instance,</p>
<h1 id="draft--1-16-september-2025">Draft -1: 16 September 2025</h1>
<p>Ok so technically I haven’t finished <em>Musicking</em> yet, but I’m optimistic. I do find it interesting that Small frames the entire book through the lens of an orchestral concert. I was assigned an article about it back when I was doing an independent study on listening to music. It was absolutely one of the most influential writings that I’ve ever encountered, if only for how it makes me think of music.</p>
<p>Small’s key argument is that music is not a thing but an action. When we music, we are listeners or performers or dancers or stage hands.</p>
<p>I love this take because it helps me to deal with that most fundamental urge of the scientist in me: labeling what is and isn’t music and who is and isn’t a musician. Music is what we make of it, and musicians are those that make it.</p>
<p>I enjoyed greatly the aside on Cartesian dualism and especially the way that Small makes a point that so much of the industrialization we live and think under is like the water a fish has no name for. I hadn’t considered the mind matter dualism really at all, especially in the context of music.</p>

<p>### monthly reflection</p>

<h1 id="monthly-reflection"><a href="reflection-september-25.html">Monthly Reflection</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2025 October 5</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-5-october-2025">Draft 1: 5 October 2025</h1>
<p>Wild, <a href="reflection-august-25">last month</a> I posted and wrote on the 4th. This month I do so on the 5th. Hopefully this is not a trend which will continue. I’d like to get back into daily postings, but who can say if that’s doable. Still, today is the last day before I become a company man, which means that it’s a perfect time to think about the past month and my past life.</p>
<p>Reflecting on last month, daily follies didn’t really end up happening, nor did finding a better term for them than follies. Dictionary of terms started to happen, but only very briefly. Have yet to really start making up terms, which is a bit of a shame.</p>
<p>I rebound my web novel, but only read the first fifteen or so of three hundred some chapters. This month, I think that it might be more productive to instead plot out the rest of the series. I just today watched a video on plotting, which suggested that the story should be seen as a series of arcs, each of which feeds into the next, which is slightly more intense, until the very end, at which point obviously the plot peaks. There’s probably an element of that which would be good to do. At the very least, I think that it could be good to remind myself where the series is supposed to end, and then figure out how to get there. Since it’s been long enough since I wrote anything for it, I don’t think that pantsing it<a href="#fn041" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> is going to work for me. Next month is NaNo though, so there’s something to be said about waiting to start writing until that starts.</p>
<p>Eh. We’ll see what happens as it happens.</p>
<p>I was on screens maybe slightly less.</p>
<p>I did not write the song for the wedding, and I have only gotten about halfway through Musicking. Binding books went generally well, and that was fun. I didn’t bring yarn, but I did bring embroidery ingredients, and did not use them.</p>
<p>Didn’t stretch much, and do still note that I am often tight.<a href="#fn042" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> I did just recently come into a massage gun, and it is wild how it actually works to improve flexibility.<a href="#fn043" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Shoulder didn’t seem to be my issue this past month, nor did it feel like the issue today. Then again, I’m still not doing my historic shoulder stretches, so maybe I’m just deluding myself.</p>
<p>I read very little of the books that I said I would get. I ended up buying a few along the journey, so in a way I read negative of the books I brought. That being said, I have finished one of the new buys, and that is certainly something to talk about in the future.</p>
<p>Meditation and prayer weren’t going great, and still aren’t. I’ve recently started reading a book about Autistic Burnout, and there’s something really interesting in it. Or, more accurately, there’s a lot that’s really interesting, but one that felt immediately actionable.</p>
<p>When people are depressed, they don’t want to do anything, and the cure is doing something. When autistic people are burning out, they don’t want to do anything, and the cure is doing nothing. I’m trying to let myself not do anything, and I am taking a lot of naps these past few days, which isn’t something I can really keep going for much longer. However, there’s something mindful about letting myself stop for a little bit.</p>
<p>I did do some meditation/prayer on the trip, but actively doing the rote prayer from my past still hurts a lot, and I don’t really know why. I’ll make time to try that this month.</p>
<p>I didn’t journal a ton, and that’s fine.</p>
<p>I did buy a sketchbook, because the part of me that wants to draw when I have nothing else going on did in fact rear its head.</p>
<p>Old daily reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did you journal by hand today?</p></li>
<li><p>Did you do a folly?</p></li>
<li><p>Did you in some way, shape, or form advance the web novel?</p></li>
<li><p>Did you work on music, whether education or creation?</p></li>
<li><p>Did you work on book binding?</p></li>
<li><p>Did you work on another hobby?</p></li>
<li><p>Did you stretch? Really?</p></li>
<li><p>Prayer?</p></li>
<li><p>Meditation?</p></li>
<li><p>Reading?</p></li>
<li><p>Minimizing screen time?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>New daily reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did you stretch?</p></li>
<li><p>Did you attempt to pray something rote?</p></li>
<li><p>What’s going on in writing?</p></li>
<li><p>How’s work?</p></li>
<li><p>Reading?</p></li>
<li><p>Sleep?</p></li>
<li><p>Water?</p></li>
<li><p>Food?</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Did you stretch?</p>
<p>Yes!</p></li>
<li><p>Did you attempt to pray something rote?</p>
<p>No. Last night I sat and realized that it’s basically been a year since my mom died, and being sad sucks.</p></li>
<li><p>What’s going on in writing?</p>
<p>Eh, doing this. Watched/listened to a few videos about writing from someone who seems like they might be right-wing, but most of the advice is still useful to me.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s work?</p>
<p>About to start.</p></li>
<li><p>Reading?</p>
<p>Restarted don’t die alone and kept going through autism.</p></li>
<li><p>Sleep?</p>
<p>Eh, I’m doing a lot of it which might be good?</p></li>
<li><p>Water?</p>
<p>I feel like I’m more aware than normal which is good.</p></li>
<li><p>Food?</p>
<p>See above.</p>

<h1 id="on-moma"><a href="moma.html">On MoMA</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 25 Septmeber 2025</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-25-september-2025">Draft 1: 25 September 2025</h1>
<p>Lasterday I went to the New York Museum of Modern Art. As I had known, but never articulated, I have a favorite kind of art: non-representational art with phyiscally meaningful texture. That is, I want to be able tosee the paint as paint, even if it is also acting as something else.<a href="#fn051" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> While looking at a Rothko, I was inspired to write a poem.<a href="#fn052" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> That seemed like as good of a way to consider the best arts I liked.</p>
<p>So, below are the poems I wrote, in the order I wrote them.</p>
<p>1:<a href="#fn053" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref3"><sup>3</sup></a><br />
In the soft and subtle shading, as blue fades to deeper blue<br />
A source of light unseen, unmentioned, seems to frame the vicious shape<br />
These blues unseen in nature seem primed to bleed off the deep red sea<br />
consume and so be consumed, the painting draws me in.</p>
<p>2:<a href="#fn054" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref4"><sup>4</sup></a><br />
Grasping hands and wailing mouths<br />
eyes as from a fog<br />
Some heaven-seen corrupted<br />
by mortal misery<br />
That blood-pure blue cuts through the clouds,<br />
Where Adam should be reaching out<br />
But Adam is gone, Creator too<br />
what’s left but bloody blue?</p>
<p>3:<br />
If Rothko screams in single shades<br />
What is this apple’s song?<br />
One stroke of green, on deepest red<br />
A mirror symmetry</p>
<p>4:<a href="#fn055" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref5"><sup>5</sup></a><br />
An oil slick of global south<br />
Metallic and contrived<br />
yet strokes of brush still visible<br />
As textures slowly wind<br />
Or is it more auroral?<br />
The Dancing night-time light?<br />
Which reminds us of the dance we’re on.<br />
When borders fin’ly cease</p>
<p>5:<a href="#fn056" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref6"><sup>6</sup></a><br />
What weight can any color hold<br />
When gravity exists?<br />
What bloody martyrs’ final cris<br />
Would echo on this painted shroud?<br />
There’s something in the sunrise scheme (scene? screen?)<br />
Which brings me to my sobbing, weakened knees.<br />
3 necks are bound like shirts or murdered men.<br />
3 times I must review this<br />
3 times, 3 views, 3 forms</p>
<p>6:<a href="#fn057" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref7"><sup>7</sup></a><br />
Soemthing in the martyr’s red on black<br />
The highlight it implies<br />
Or in the white of careless folds<br />
Which frame on further pause<br />
I could not but stop and stare</p>
<p>7:<a href="#fn058" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref8"><sup>8</sup></a><br />
the concrete does not speak to me<br />
too fixed in vapid form.<br />
To swim, to dance, a gambling lifetime chance<br />
A body broken, bent</p>
<p>8:<a href="#fn059" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref9"><sup>9</sup></a><br />
What suffering countless centuries have seen<br />
caused rudely (hah) by the sacrifice, which suffering was meant to cease<br />
9:<a href="#fn0510" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref10"><sup>10</sup></a><br />
Fifteen by seven, pinned neatly in a grid<br />
Fifteen by seven sketches of man, bread,<a href="#fn0511" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref11"><sup>11</sup></a><br />
Fifteen by seven, so Fifty some left out<br />
Fifteen by seven shades of life and living<br />
Fifteen by seven by one<br />
Fifteen by seven, once alive, now butterflies, hung.</p>
<p>10:<a href="#fn0512" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref12"><sup>12</sup></a><br />
The tears creation wept<br />
The tans of toxic waste<br />
the figure of a little boy<br />
pulled to the cage of the sky</p>
<p>11:<a href="#fn0513" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref13"><sup>13</sup></a><br />
The threnody of misery<br />
THe sextet of dispair<br />
The chains of dying broken men<br />
The gears of war spin ever and forever on without cease<br />
A plane may crash<br />
And more will die</p>
<p>12:<a href="#fn0514" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref14"><sup>14</sup></a><br />
This tryptich soon will haunt my dreams<br />
Forms caged in static line<br />
Yet closer inspection quickly uncovers<br />
The forms are broken fragments<br />
held, preserved in gem and love</p>
<p>13:<a href="#fn0515" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref15"><sup>15</sup></a><br />
It’s rudely crude, a relic from a long-held past<br />
An animation of a woman forced<br />
Art from numbers, tabbed and punched in cards into machine</p>
<p>14:<a href="#fn0516" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref16"><sup>16</sup></a><br />
I want to come another time<br />
To see the mark I’ve left<br />
in uncured light consuming<br />
In magnetic holding up</p>
<p>15:<a href="#fn0517" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref17"><sup>17</sup></a><br />
Monuments to a fallen king<br />
Made by his own two hands<br />
The shape, though fixed, is rough and mixed<br />
No two of six the same<br />
Is man unable to imagine<br />
Some great work not made of iron?<br />
Or like the blood that others shed<br />
Or like the callused worker’s hands<br />
Or Or like the song of hammerblow?<br />
16:<a href="#fn0518" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref18"><sup>18</sup></a><br />
I wish my life was just this perfect<br />
Clean lines to be defined with popped out text</p>
<p>Well, fun to see that I did very much get caught on metaphor, and fun to see the way that they shifted as I kept writing. Even though this is the order I wrote the poems, it’s not the order that I approached the works. I ceased returning to the initial works after 12, because I was very lost, so 13–16<a href="#fn0519" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref19"><sup>19</sup></a> are from the memory and terrible photo of the pieces I have. 12 was the first of the paintings written about that I saw.</p>
<p>Anyways, love modern art, I should go more.</p>

<h1 id="on-speed"><a href="speed.html">On Speed</a></h1>
<p>First Published:</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-23-september-2025">Draft 1: 23 September 2025</h1>
<p>Last night I went to dinner with some college friends. It was a wonderful time, and as may be unsurprising, we eventually got ontot he topic of media we consume. I mentioned that I consume my media at multiples of the nominally intended speed, and they expressed potential interest in it. Of course, I have also received any number of objections to this method from others in my life.</p>
<p>The most salient objection I can think of is that the speed something plays does a lot to communicate. Humor is reliant on timing, and so on. For whatever reason, I find this only to be true for me in musical terms; a song or musical interlude played faster or slower feels fundamentally different in a way that speech faster or slower does not. Perhaps this is because speed is relative in most vocalizations but absolute in music.</p>
<p>Regardless, I think that the point of creator’s intent is a reasonable objection to my consumption. Of course, there’s much to be said for the fact that I consume almost nothing as it was originally intended. All music written before the 1900s was intended to be played and enjoyed live. Any music outside of the Western canon is and was meant to be enjoyed actively, whether via dance, participation, or verbal appreciation.<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>When I read a book, there is almost no chance that I read the book at the exact pace an author assumes. Then again, as an author, I do not think that I have a pace that I intend my book to be read. There’s an inherent serial nature to much of this writing, and especially my web serial. That being said, given that many serialized fiction is presented and resold as a single compendium, it’s clear that’s not important either.</p>
<p>Do directors and creators of film and television intend for shows to be at the speed they are?</p>
<p>Does what they intend reflect in what they create?</p>
<p>I am reminded of the finale of Game of Thrones, which is now infamously mocked for having absolutely atrocious lighting. Audio in general these days is poorly mixed and recorded, and much of the art of the process has been lost. If I am watching something where craft was not a major part of the process, how much should I respect the craft?</p>
<p>When we talk about the way that nothing lasts, part of it is due to intentionally planned obselescence. However, there is also the inherently craftless nature of what we produce. Few people I know can or would willingly create something intentionally subpar. It is only in this current economic and industrial model, where creation is so fundamentally removed from human touch, that planned obselescence can be possible, or that clothing which disintigrates upon washing can exist.</p>
<p>This is not to say that I think premodern society was better than our current one. This is to say, however, that consuming modern media at speeds outside of those the director may have designed does not feel wrong to me.</p>
<p>Taking it even one step further, I think about the fact that music has been almost completely subsumed in the craft of film. Music does not exist for anything except for the emotional responses we have been trained to have to it. Society<a href="#fn062" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> rails against Muzak, and so I see nothing wrong with railing against the emotionally manipulative nature of music in television and film.</p>
<p>Again, though, I can consier older works, where lighting and sound were considered. They would never have imagined me watching on a computer screen. Should I also not watch it like that?</p>

<h1 id="on-emptiness"><a href="emptiness.html">On Emptiness</a></h1>
<p>First Published:</p>
<h1 id="draft-2-22-september-2025">Draft 2: 22 September 2025</h1>
<p>What does it mean to be empty?</p>
<p>Is it an absence? The absence of my mother weighs on me daily. The absence of food in my stomach or water in my system cries out to be sated.</p>
<p>Is it a void? Atoms in the interstellar medium can go centuries or millenia without encountering another. On days when I feel most alone, I feel like one of those atoms.</p>
<p>Is it clarity? Only by emptying the space between viewer and object can the object be seen. To empty oneself of doubt and fear is a power spiritual experience.</p>
<p>Is it calmness? In the modern society, life is defined by motion and excess. To stop, then, and simply be, feels as though it carries with it a sense of emptiness.</p>
<p>What does it mean to be empty? Where is the line between numbness and emotional stability? What are the words I can use to express the feeling of depression, where the weight of some unknowable and uncaring burden drags each motion. Unlike the suffering of the martyr, there is no sense of purpose.</p>
<p>What does it mean to rest? Is rest another form of emptiness? Should I think of it as laying down the burdens I carry? Should I think of it as a way to refill myself after carrying a heavy load?</p>
<p>When I write to the point no more words are there, have I created an emptiness? I often refer to the feeling as having run my well dry. Have I not, rather, filled the page and my mind with the ideas in the writing?</p>
<p>Thermodynamics assures that energy cannot be created nor destroyed. Relativity assures that matter and energy can be interchanged. In order to empty one location, another must be filled.</p>
<p>Is emptiness, then, a matter of perspective?</p>
<p>Is it possible to empty a space without filling another? What about the void of space? As space itself grows, the distances between stars grows as well. Is that emptiness?</p>
<p>What does it mean to be empty, except to be removed from what is dear?</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-22-september-2025">Draft 1: 22 September 2025</h1>
<p>I don’t entirely know what my goal is here. Yesterday I started reading “Bluets”, a reflection on the color blue and a semi-memoir, at the recommendation of the bookseller.<a href="#fn071" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Near the beginning, it mentions that there was a French author<a href="#fn072" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> who, upon coming to athiesm, started referring to the sky as the blue, rather than the heavens.<a href="#fn073" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref3"><sup>3</sup></a> I thought about that, and the fact that I too find the use of words more meaningful than they may at first seem. Does English’s general usage of sky rather than heavens point to the general athiesm of modern Anglophone culture?</p>
<p>Then, I got on a train. During the train ride, I did not reflect, I did not muse, I did not craft follies. Instead, I played a new video game I got.<a href="#fn074" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref4"><sup>4</sup></a> While playing, the hours did pass away. However, rather than ending the game feeling accomplished, or even satisfied, I mostly felt numb.</p>
<p>I went for a short walk after reading the opening 50 pages of “Bluets”, and I reflected on my own emotions.<a href="#fn075" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref5"><sup>5</sup></a> I recalled that, when depressed, there’s a painful sense of emptiness. When I feel strong emotions, it can be tempting to say that I would rather feel nothing. Remembering the words I used while feeling nothing, however, I am able to take the emotions more easily.</p>
<p>I do not think that I could write a long exploration of the color blue. I think that, if I was to write a color-memoir, I would use the color red.</p>
<p>What does it mean to be empty?</p>
<p>As someone who frequently forgets to eat or drink, there exists the immediate physical meaning. My stomach growls, my throat gets parched, and my body tells me that there is a void to be filled.</p>
<p>When I am able to meditate, or wake up from a blissful sleep, I find that my mind has nothing within it. Unlike the negative emptiness of unmet physical needs, this is an emptiness of negatives.</p>
<p>When I finished playing the game yesterday, my mind was empty in a neutral to negative way. The emptiness inside was not because I had only vague senses of positive sentiment, but because everything had been pushed down.</p>
<p>What does it mean to be empty?</p>
<p>I think that emptiness is a hard word, because to me it feels connotatively neutral. That’s good, insofar as like often we want a neutral word to describe both the positive and negative ways to have an absence.</p>
<p>My life for almost a year now has been marked by a pretty dramatic absence.</p>
<p>Is no longer being a student an absence, a void, an emptiness?</p>
<p>What is the positive way to say an absence?</p>
<p>Is it a calmness? Is it idleness? Is it clarity?</p>
<p>After all, in order for something to be clearly seen, it cannot have obstructions in its way.</p>
<p>Can I seek emptiness without filling myself to void?</p>

<h1 id="on-teaching-optimization"><a href="teaching-optimization.html">On Teaching Optimization</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 18 September 2025</p>
<h1 id="draft-2-18-september-2025">Draft 2: 18 September 2025</h1>
<p>A beloved friend recently asked the question about learning pedagogy, “is it not enough to just teach well, as best you’re able?”. I think that it’s really evocative question, for a variety of reasons. Not least, what does it mean to teach well, and what does it mean to teach as best as I am able?</p>
<p>I am able to lift far more weight when I learn proper form. I am able to swim far faster with proper form. I can learn far more adeptly with better strategies. It is perhaps unsurprisng to me, then, that I believe that I can teach better by learning more.</p>
<p>Of course, the connection to better learning is probably the most apt. It’s incredibly tempting to spend hours upon hours trying to design a perfectly optimized study plan. A “less optimized” plan, by contrast, is likely to generate more learning if those same hours are used to study instead. Similar tension exists in the realm of teaching.</p>
<p>In my view, there are a number of things that can make it easier or harder to teach. For example, I once taught a chemistry course where we taught oxidation numbers five<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> weeks before the electron. When students asked what it meant that Oxygen is minus two<a href="#fn082" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> means, I had no other recourse but to say “wait a few weeks”. In general, a bad curriculum makes it nearly impossible to be a good teacher. The best I could teach there was far worse than the best I could teach in the astronomy course where I had more curricular flexibility.</p>
<p>Still, the research which exists tends to cover a single class or few classes of students. Sometimes these demographics are easily mapped onto the demographics of a different classroom. Just thinking about the difference in classroom dynamic between my undergraduate and graduate institutions, however, it is also clear that this mapping may not always be useful.</p>
<p>So, then, is it seeking optimization for its own sake to learn the current best practices of pedagogy?</p>
<p>I think especially at the point in career my beloved is at, where there is no expectation of designing a curriculum, let alone teaching a full course, it’s generally better to know more than less. When it comes time to create a course, however, I think that it’s likely productive procrastination at best to look for the optimal ways to design a course rather than spending the mental and temporal effort on structuring the course day by day and overall. I hope my views are coherent?</p>
<h1 id="draft-1.5-18-september-2025">Draft 1.5: 18 September 2025</h1>
<p>What does it mean to be a good teacher?</p>
<p>A good teacher has good curriculum, good in class presence, and forms good connections with students. I don’t think that any of these are contrary to each other, and in general I even think that the three are linked.<a href="#fn083" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref3"><sup>3</sup></a> So, then, what does it mean to be good at each of these?</p>
<p>Being good at connection seems the easiest to define, if only because it’s the hardest to quantify.<a href="#fn084" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Students should feel safe bringing up questions, should want to attend class, and should learn. Anything else then falls into the individual professor’s preference. As a person who has never had their place in the Academy questioned, I find it important that students do not see me as someone inherently above them. For the professors I’ve had with different identities which lead them to not have this same implicit level of authority, the reverse is often needed. Whether or not students should feel comfortable bringing up their interpersonal extra-class conflicts for advice is entirely up to the professor’s discretion, in my mind.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>What does it mean to have good in class presence? I think that it means that classes are led in a way that is best for student learning. This is where a lot of the education research comes, I think. I think that it’s also important to be more than a machine, though. In order to connect to students, there needs to be flexibility in the class plan.</p>
<p>Finally, what does it mean to have a good curriculum? Students have clear ideas of what they should learn, an effective path to the knowledge, and ideally the professor doesn’t need to think much in the day to day.</p>
<p>When building a course, then, how important is it to stay exactly up to date?</p>
<p>I’d generally argue not very. In general, if professors are willing to place themselves in the role of a learner, then most decisions are fairly easy to make. After all, I know no one who thinks that they learn best from pure lecture. So, I do not need to read the literature to know that I should maybe not do pure lecture.</p>
<p>Of course, then we get to that fun dichotomy of perceived and real learning. If I remember correctly, flipped classrooms have significantly lower perceived learning but higher real learning. In my general view, it’s more important for students to learn than to feel like they’ve learned. In some regards, it is almost ideal that they leave the course feeling as if they’ve learned nothing, because that implies a deep level of integration for all the knowledge.</p>
<p>Flipped classrooms have the secondary benefit of reduced workload. Once lectures are recorded a single time, the professor is free to use them and work on in-class exercises.</p>
<p>Hmm, I guess that I am agreeing with the initial consideration.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-18-september-2025">Draft 1: 18 September 2025</h1>
<p>To be clear, this folly<a href="#fn085" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref5"><sup>5</sup></a> is not about the teaching of optimization. Rather, it is written in response to a dear friend’s consideration after attending a lecture on chemistry education. The main thrust of the argument, as I read, at least,<a href="#fn086" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref6"><sup>6</sup></a> is that there may be an over-emphasis on teaching optimally. Is this just another example of the modern optimization grindset?</p>
<p>My initial response is that trying to change my teaching to better help students learn is not an example of optimization gone too far. One quote in particular stands out to me right now, “is it not enough to just teach well, as best you’re able?”</p>
<p>I’ve reflected on what it means to do something to my best ability before, likely multiple times. In light of that, let’s quickly summarize what I think that I came to as a conclusion. Just as editing and revising prose or poetry does not make it less authentic, neither does learning better strategies preclude doing the best I can. Much like with lifting, where the best I can do is easily measured as the heaviest. Learning better form is likely to improve the highest I can lift.</p>
<p>Certainly this can go too far, however. When I think about what teaching to the best of my ability means, I think that it’s a balancing act between more than a few different sinks. What are they? Not totally sure, but this is a great place to explore.<a href="#fn087" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Obviously subject mastery is part of it. There are arguments I could see for not updating material, especially introductory material, in light of new discoveries. That is, I have a vague memory of learning that SN1 and SN2 reactions are not as evenly split as we were taught in school. However, there’s also something to be said for a shared base of knowledge. Especially in science, where all knowledge is definitionally approximate, is there something wrong with the lie to children we teach being one we ourselves were taught? I’m not totally sure.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it is still obviously important to know the material one teaches. If students ask questions that are outside of the lesson plan, then it is good to be able to give them a true and accurate answer, at least to their current skill level. Also, being able to point to current developments in the field gives students who are extra motivated places to explore their interest.</p>
<p>Course planning is another aspect. It’s generally good, in my view, at least, to have a coherent arc of teaching through the semester. This may not be totally up to the individual instructor, since I know that many places require certain skills to be taught in certain orders. Even if not that, though, it’s expected that students leave courses within a track with a certain set of knowledge. I’d like to hope that the knowledge students are expected to carry with them is clearly laid out somewhere, even if only visibly to the department instructors.</p>
<p>Decisions about grading, assessment, and assignment also fall here, in my view. Decisions about format, be it virtual or in-person or flipped or mixed or workshop are also under course planning.</p>
<p>At some very quick point, however, it’s likely that working on course planning can fall into the trap of hyper optimization. I agree that in general it’s best not to try to live life totally focused on optimization. Knowing that time is limited, however, I do also think that there’s something to be said for prioritizing time. The gains students might have between slight differences in assignment types are likely overshadowed by any number of other considerations.</p>
<p>At the more micro level, there’s the individual lesson plan for each class period. I’ve never had a strong one of these, but the fact that nearly every person with degrees in education I know uses them implies that there is clearly merit. It was nice having a course where the handout at the beginning of each period was the expected learning and plans for the day.</p>
<p>I think that it is within the lesson plans that I see most of the research, and where I think optimization can quickly spiral out. Is it better to spend five hours thinking about exactly how well the assessment tracks the pyramid structure or the same five hours coming up with other possible questions? I personally think that the latter is better.</p>
<p>I also think that there is something in modern education research in the idea of pre-thinking. That is, there’s a benefit to knowing exactly what is going to happen in the lesson ahead of time, rather than having to extemporize day of. If teaching the same course year after year, doing this once up front saves the time for future terms.</p>
<p>So, keeping up on the education literature would seem to have merit. However, student experience is going to be different than the experience of the research. There’s a joke my brothers and I bring up fairly often, “people misunderstand the Stanford Prison Experiment; it isn’t that people are monsters, it’s that Stanford students are monsters”. That is, different campuses will have different demographics and cultures. My undergraduate, for instance, prioritized teaching us the bare minimum to be able to delve deeply into our interest later. Or, at least, that’s how it felt, especially since each major was only allowed to require like 8 courses.</p>
<p>So talking to your students and treating them as not interchangable is important. However, the more interchangably students are treated, the more able one is to avoid falling into implicit bias. Hmm, that’s a hard one.</p>
<p>I feel like I’ve gotten rambly here, so let’s try again from the top. Draft 1.5 is just going to be thinking about what it means to be a good teacher, and then Draft 2 maybe bring the two together.</p>

<h1 id="on-mindfulness"><a href="mindfulness.html">On Mindfulness</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2025 September 16</p>
<h1 id="draft-4-16-september-2025">Draft 4: 16 September 2025</h1>
<p>One of those I hold dearest and nearest to my heart recently posted a consideration<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> about wanting to be less connected to telephones and occupy time more mindfully in general. I too, wish that I was less attached to screens and more present in my day to day. Even had my dearest friend not posted the consideration, though, I think that i might have come to this folly on my own. As I have been mentioning, I’m on a train, and have been now for more than a full calendar day. Something about the nature of riding a train feels almost designed to foster mindful usage of time.</p>
<p>In part, I think it is because of the fundamentally intentional nature of riding a train. Unlike cars, who nominally follow lanes, or planes which do so solely out of agreement, trains can only run on a single path. There do exist depots to change lines, but they are few and far between. The route I ride is not one which is being chosen by the train conductor; it was chosen by the backs of countless men whose labor built the rails through the empire.</p>
<p>Even more than that, though, the train is filled with windows. Each moment is a new vista. Each blink misses some ineffable piece of a beautiful reality.</p>
<p>Travel by train is also not perfectly smooth. As the train rides along, there are gentle hills and vales, bumps and turns. Each one is an invitation to remember that time, like the train passes by.</p>
<p>Finally, travel by train is fundamentally opposed to the modern optimization and multitasking model. Trains move around the speed of a car, though slightly slower usually. That is, they move far slower than a plane. Also unlike a plane, the trains I have been on do not have any WiFi connections. I’ve been in dead zones which last hours on end, and so there is no way for me to ignore my present with the allure of the online.</p>
<p>These past few weeks, I have found myself living minimally. That is, I have been making few decisions, and generally letting the flow of life move me along. I play games because they occupy my time. Partially as a response to my reflection last night, I came into this morning wanting to be more mindful of the passage of time. I think I can call it a success, given that I’ve written more than two drafts of a musing, bound a book, read eleven chapters of my web novel, three chapters of <em>Musicking</em>, and meditated for forty minutes.<a href="#fn092" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> It is not yet 1500, meaning that I still have more than 9 hours with which to continue to use the day.</p>
<p>Why, though, have I been living minimally?</p>
<p>Computer and phone screens are optimized and designed to draw me in. The quick rush of scrolling or watching a screen go boom are engaging to base parts of myself, and that’s something that I cannot control. This is not to let myself off, however.</p>
<p>What is to let myself off is the realization that it’s been two weeks since I finished the paperwork for my doctorate. Fourteen days to recenter after decades of schooling feels reasonable to me. However, fourteen days feels like enough, at least today. I know that I am most happy with my memories in days and weeks where I pushed myself. Never do I look back on days where I was gentle with myself and be happy for it; the most I can do is accept that it was likely necessary to rest.</p>
<p>So, in the interest of being more mindful, I look at my daily reflection. In general, the one I’ve struggled most with is the idea of not looking at screens. For whatever reason, I can often read for far longer on a phone or computer than I can with physical books. I can also write for far longer on a computer, though that is far less surprising; I both have a faster output (matching my thoughts) and can do so for longer without pain (both because less motion and ones I’m more familiar with). However, there are obviously gradations to what it means to use a screen.</p>
<p>Writing these follies, for instance, feels a reasonable use of the screen. I can and often do gaze out the window at the passing scenery as the words appear on the page.<a href="#fn093" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Also, it is something mentally engaging and that brings me closer to the sort of person I wish to be. Reading on my phone or computer can likely have similar benefits, but perhaps because I cannot look away from the screen while consuming, I find it far less acceptable towards the goal.</p>
<p>In general, I want to become the sort of person that I want to become. That feels like a tautology, partially because it is, but also because I don’t entirely know what person I want to become. There are arguments in philosophy of belief about what it means to believe something, and I more and more find myself agreeing with the idea that belief and action are intrinsically linked. That is, you can, in fact, tell what someone believes by how they act. I’d like to be someone that believes time is precious<a href="#fn094" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref4"><sup>4</sup></a>, and that means I need to act like it. I want to be someone that creates, and that means creating. I want to be someone with thoughtful and well-derived opinions; that means I need to read broadly and deeply.</p>
<p>While I cannot choose to believe immediately, I can take the paths which branch towards a better version of me. Rather than blindly walking a rut in life, I can choose to look up, seeing the rushing river<a href="#fn095" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref5"><sup>5</sup></a> that marks many other winding paths. Mindful life is a goal, not a destination. Each day, I can try to believe in mindful life more.</p>
<p>Post Script<br />
It occurs to me that I also don’t want this to fall into the trap of the capitalist “every moment must be optimized”. Treating time as precious means living actively, not always filling the day. Sitting and looking at the way the stones break the tide is just as precious a use of time as generating something for others to consume. I need to remind myself of this often, especially in context of what it means to have spent time well.</p>
<p>Time being something one can spend, after all, fundamentally puts time as a form of capital.</p>
<h1 id="draft-3.1-16-september-2025">Draft 3.1: 16 September 2025</h1>
<h2 id="meta-commentary">Meta-commentary</h2>
<p>It occurs to me that the initial goal of drafts was to see the way that a thought developed. Right now, I am treating each draft more like a small essay of its own. In the past, I would title those with fractions of draft numbers. Of course, most of the time I would do so in fragmentary ways, rather than these (relatively) complete drafts. Still, I think that there are often ideas expressed within different drafts that all belong in the “final” version of a post. With that in mind, let’s try generating a full draft of what we have</p>
<h2 id="real-text">Real Text</h2>
<p>For this partial draft, I think that I want to mostly free write about what I think is important in each draft, starting at the beginning.<a href="#fn096" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Draft 1:</p>
<p>I mention the fact that this folly is inspired by a friend’s quest towards mindfulness and better texting. I want to live better, including an idea I don’t develop about how I can read for longer on phone than on paper. I know (novel) that I can also write for far longer on computer than by hand, though that may be equally speed of typing as ease of writing; my hands do not cramp when I type.</p>
<p>I point out that I am generally happiest when I drove myself like a task master. I reflected on the fact that productive is not the word I want, though it is at least close to the idea I want.</p>
<p>I reflect on the mindful nature of trains, where scenery is momentary.</p>
<p>Finally, I talk about the changes I wanted to make towards myself today.</p>
<p>Or, really finally, I end with the note from my brother, who is exploring meditation.</p>
<p>Draft 2:</p>
<p>I comment on how passive I am experiencing life, and again run into the fact that my words paint a picture of me as capital. Overstimulation becoming stimulation, and the way that double media consumption means that the odds of both ending together are minimal. Found a typo, but discussed a way to maybe be better at playing the game by stopping when it stops being fun. (new) it did work.</p>
<p>I reflected on being scared of boredom, but I don’t actually think that’s resonant with me. I think that I’m just bored of being bored. Might be worthwhile to try just turning everything off for an hour and staring out the window? (novel)</p>
<p>I went through to see how much media I wanted to consume. Perhaps because I did so, I then consumed the media more quickly.</p>
<p>Finally, Draft 3:</p>
<p>I reflect on the difference between intentionality and mindfulness, especially in relation to trains, which cannot move as freely as other forms of transport. I also point out that trains are slower and more divorced from the broader world.<a href="#fn097" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>I point out the comfort, and the way that I am becoming more connected with physical, rather than digital, time.</p>
<p>Finally, I end with the note that I am generally mentally engaged. These past weeks are probably better seen as recovery from the effort of my dissertation, rather than my new norm, when it comes to how I learn and grow.</p>
<p>Now to try sitting mindfully for an hour looking out the window, and then to write Draft 4.</p>
<p>Welp. Made it 36 minutes, but then the train came to a stop. Hard to stop thinking and not sleep.</p>
<h1 id="draft-3-16-september-2025">Draft 3: 16 September 2025</h1>
<p>This next draft<a href="#fn098" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref8"><sup>8</sup></a> may belong better in my folly <a href="trains.html">On Trains</a>, but it will lie here instead.</p>
<p>I am not entirely sure where the line between intentionality and mindfulness lies. Certainly they describe two different modes of operating in the universe, as they are two different words.<a href="#fn099" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref9"><sup>9</sup></a> I wonder if it may be a causal relationship. By living with intention, life becomes mindful. Or is it that when approaching life with mindfulness, intentionality comes out.</p>
<p>I suppose in setting the causal relationship, I can start to tease a difference out. Intentionality requires action, while mindfulness does not. I can intentionally sit and do nothing, but the absence of doing becomes the action. Mindfully sitting, however, may result in doing nothing.</p>
<p>It is perhaps unsurprising that I find myself playing with the border between these two terms. Trains are, in many regards, the most intentional of forms of transit. They can only move along perfectly prescribed paths, and only those trains which are constructed with rails at the exact same distance are able to ride. Contrast this with cars and motorcycles, which though nominally bound, can still at least in theory break from the street. Abstracted further, boats follow what they call sea lanes, but they are not fixed nor mandated. At the final level, planes fly in three dimensional space. Even though constrained to go in set patterns, there is nothing in the form itself which requires the movement.</p>
<p>And yet, despite the fact that planes are theoretically freer than cars, modern travel makes cars the freest option. I suppose that if I were able to fly my own plane I might feel differently, but. If I were to do this trip via plane, there would have been a similar number of locations that I could go to, with similarly constrained scheduling. Of course, planes are faster than trains, so what is a daily or sub-daily arrival can happen hourly.</p>
<p>If I were to have driven this, there would have been functionally no constraints on the way I traveled. Far from being intentional about when I reach and leave each location, I would be able to even choose where I travel on a whim.</p>
<p>It is perhaps this freedom in cars that makes driving feel so much less intentional to me. Even though there is almost always a best route, rare are the roads which do not at least allow for a diversion every few hours.</p>
<p>It is perhaps the speed which keeps me from feeling intentional on a plane.</p>
<p>On a train, however, the touch of the maker is everywhere. I pass by the same route that has been tread countless times by countless others. Unlike in a car, I know that my train follows the identical route; there is nowhere else its rails can take it. And, the train seems almost designed for intentional travel. In today’s fast-paced world of planes, the train travels no faster than a car. In a world where even planes are beginning to get high-speed WiFi, all of the trains I have driven on either removed their WiFi or never had it to begin with. Hours at a time see me unable to reach cellular service.</p>
<p>Unlike in a car, however, this inability to connect to the outside world does not leave me feeling a sense of fear. I am not in control of the motion, and the system is designed to make it hard or impossible to collide with another train.</p>
<p>Too, the train has a viewing deck. Even outside of this area with chairs facing towards the windows, the seating area has windows larger than in my home. My view of nature is just obstructed enough to remind me that I am enlosed in a climate protected shell. The scenery passes me by, and because trains were laid with linear intention, we pass through the mountains, rather than looping around them as cars are oft to. Because trains do not turn well, the track does not whip me about.</p>
<p>And so, even though I find myself fighting to break the habits which call for me to live mindlessly, the mere act of riding a train pushes me towards a mindful state. While I can wander up and down the aisles, there are still only four cars. I can stream non-local media when there is service, but it is so variable as to be difficult. I can waste my time away<a href="#fn0910" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref10"><sup>10</sup></a> by playing games, and yet even still the not-infrequent bumps mean that I am never able to completely escape the reality of motion, unlike on a plane or while stationary. The passage of time flows by me, and though I am untethered from hours and minutes, I am much more tied to the time of day. I watched the sunrise from dawn through nearly noon. I watched the sunfire sky fade into night.</p>
<p>Of course, this may equally be that I am simply finally recovering from the burnout of writing my thesis. I often found<a href="#fn0911" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref11"><sup>11</sup></a> that I would only make it a few days or a week into any given break before I would be done with rest and once again yearn for motion and action. Or, at the very least, I become able to sit with myself again. I want to play the games right now, but I think this is a legitimate want, rather than simply a question of filling my hours. I’m going to try asking myself after each round whether I actually enjoy the gameplay loop still. If the answer is no, then I will set the game down and find another activity.</p>
<h1 id="draft-2-16-september-2025">Draft 2: 16 September 2025</h1>
<p>One of my dearest friends recently posted a consideration<a href="#fn0912" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref12"><sup>12</sup></a> on the theme of mindfulness. It made me think about the fact that, despite my own goals to experience this month more mindfully, I have really been fairly passively spending my time.<a href="#fn0913" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref13"><sup>13</sup></a> I am on the way back to the middle from the western portion of the trip, which makes this as good a time as any other, if not a better one, to think about how to better use my time.<a href="#fn0914" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>So, why do I passively take in time?</p>
<p>I do enjoy playing the games that I play, at least at first. However, much like the joke of “oh no, there’s milk left over after I finished my cookies... oh no there are cookies left over after I finished my milk”, I never seem to end the games in sync with whatever media I’m consuming. There’s a form of the hedonic treadmill: neither listening to the podcast nor playing the game feels stimulating enough on their own, and so I tie them together. Perhaps in the same way that I consume media<a href="#fn0915" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref15"><sup>15</sup></a>, I feel that it’s less unproductive to consume more media in the same time period. Of course, there’s nothing about this phase of my life that requires production.</p>
<p>I suppose one answer to the wasting time is to reflect after each game whether or not I’m still actively having fun. If not, I can stop the game. I do know that decision fatigue is a real thing, however. Then again, I’m kept in this train for the rest of the day. Assuming that decision fatigue is reset at sleep, there’s minimal that I can choose other than being mindless.<a href="#fn0916" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Why else do I passively pass through the stream of time?<a href="#fn0917" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>Boredom is scary. It don’t think that I’m yet in a great mental place in regards to the death of my mother and the death of the part of me that is a student. When I stop to let my mind go where it will, I worry that I’ll get stuck somewhere darker than I can escape. Writing it out, though, I hate that option. Fear will not define me unless I let it, and I refuse to let it right now.</p>
<p>Other than fear of boredom, ease of getting trapped in loops, and a vague feeling of wanting to consume, is there anything else that drives me not to be mindful?</p>
<p>Lack of inspiration maybe; there’s nothing I have with me that I particularly want to give my time to. I suppose that I have yet to do the philosophy books, and those would likely work really well. I enjoy book binding, at least in theory<a href="#fn0918" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref18"><sup>18</sup></a>, and I said that I wanted to learn philosophy. That’s still true enough, and so maybe when I finish here, I’ll once again work on reading the web novel, and then bind the book. For now, I’m comfortable goign through the media that I have until I’ve caught up<a href="#fn0919" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref19"><sup>19</sup></a> on all the things I said I would do. Then again, 160 items is a lot. I’m curious how much time they’ll take.</p>
<p>At single speed: 86 hours, 15 minutes if I include the audio drama, 56 hours, 45 minutes if not. At 3x speed, that means about 28 hours 45 minutes or 19 hours. By the end of the trip I’ll have absoluitley gone though the first of those, and likely the second as well. However, it’s enough that I don’t think that I need to pace myself lest I run out of content.<a href="#fn0920" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>For now, let’s see what book binding feels like while listening to some of the videos. I’ll come back and reflect on that then. maybe then also read some of the books I’m binding. Current time as of sitting down to bind intro to phenomen and musicking: 758. 16 folios for musicking later: 806. One hour later, the other book is folded, and musicking is finished. Listened to about 1.3 hours of 3x speed, which feels about right?</p>
<p>Now to go read!<a href="#fn0921" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<h1 id="draft-1-15-september-2025">Draft 1: 15 September 2025</h1>
<p>One of my friends is considering ways to live more mindfully and to also be better at texting. Despite the fact that these two goals feel almost intrinsically opposed, I cannot say that I don’t understand. I think that I would benefit from being worse at texting, but both of us share the sentiment that we would be better served by using phones less. So, why do I want to live mindfully?</p>
<p>At a gut level, I think that it’s probably generally better to live life experientially than passively. When I’m on the phone or media-maxing<a href="#fn0922" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref22"><sup>22</sup></a>, I don’t have time to sit with myself. Even when just on the train, I find myself getting bored after just a few minutes. For some reason, I can read for far longer on my phone than on my computer.</p>
<p>I’m not entirely sure what the solution is. On the one hand, most of the platforms I use to contact people also have space for me to mindlessly scroll. I also enjoy being up to date on the trends of my generation. On the other, I do really love the concept of living authentically. I’ve talked a lot with some people about how I may live too much for the future. That is, I rarely look back at myself and wish that I had been gentler on myself.<a href="#fn0923" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Rather, I find that I am most happy with my life when I was pushing myself.</p>
<p>I’m just over a week into my journey across the country. I’m just over two weeks into my journey as a Doctor.</p>
<p>In that time, I have been far less productive than I have desired. Productive is not exactly the word I’m looking for, however. Much as I would have liked to do more posts or get back into my web novel, I also wanted to be on my devices less and be more present. I wanted to bind the books I’ve packed and read them.</p>
<p>Maybe the word I’m looking for is actually mindful. I have not been as mindful of my time and place as I’ve wanted.</p>
<p>Something about riding on the train is fundamentally geared towards mindfulness. The scenery is constantly passing by, and so each sight out the window is different from every view before and after. I’ve seen countless stunning vistas that passed away before I was able to get my phone out to photograph them.<a href="#fn0924" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Whenever I look up from a screen or book or nap, I find my breath almost taken away by the beauty of the land.<a href="#fn0925" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>So, as I get ready to end my day<a href="#fn0926" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref26"><sup>26</sup></a>, I think on the ways that I can be better going forward. There’s a philosophy channel I follow who talks a fair amount about belief. Apparently, there exists a fairly large strain in the philosophy of belief that claims belief is fundamentally tied to action; if I do not act a way, I do not truly believe. From that, being better to me means equally setting better beliefs and acting in accordance with those stated beliefs. Looking at my daily reflection, I think that there is something to be said for the goals I set. I will try to go stretch and pray now, and then I’ll lie down and see how I feel in a few minutes. Maybe I’ll be up again for some composition, maybe I’ll want to read my web novel. Maybe I’ll want to use my screen and need to remind myself that while the base parts of me want to spend all day staring at media, the rest of me does not. As my brother said, “it’s about making the media in your mind.”</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Did you journal by hand today?</p>
<p>I did! After a lovely breakfast with an old Virginian.<a href="#fn0927" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Did you do a folly?</p>
<p>Yesterday! I also wrote a draft of today’s yesterday, which is kind of fun.</p></li>
<li><p>Did you in some way, shape, or form advance the web novel?</p>
<p>Yesterday after posting the folly I read nine chapters. This morning I have read 11 chapters. That means that I just have like 250 to go.</p></li>
<li><p>Did you work on music, whether education or creation?</p>
<p>No. I listened to an audio book, so not even music in that sense. I guess that I did talk a fair amount about music in some chapters of the web novel!</p></li>
<li><p>Did you work on book binding?</p>
<p>The novel is now fully bound! Other than that, though, no. Yet another activity I can do.</p></li>
<li><p>Did you work on another hobby?</p>
<p>I played video games, and listened to podcasts and audiobooks. I think that counts.</p></li>
<li><p>Did you stretch? Really?</p>
<p>Yes! Before bed I stretched and then this morning after breakfast I stretched again.</p></li>
<li><p>Prayer?</p>
<p>A little bit. Still hard for me to know what to pray.</p></li>
<li><p>Meditation?</p>
<p>Yeah! Or at the very least, sitting without explicit stimulus and trying to have a quiet mind.</p></li>
<li><p>Reading?</p>
<p>Eh.</p></li>
<li><p>Minimizing screen time?</p>
<p>Eh.</p></li>
