<p>It’s been almost six months since I last mused about feeling wrung dry. Then again, the absence of posts does imply something about the post that would’ve happened.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I embroider today? Left it in my car, will try to remember to do tomorrow.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I play guitar today? I did! Not much, but I picked it up, which is good. I should probably replace the strings soon.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I practice touch typing today? I got through Y! That means my newest letter is C<a href="#fn001" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Reading</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have I made progress on my Currently Reading Shelf? A little! I also started a new book which isn’t the point.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I read the book on craft? Nope! I brought it with me through the day, though.</p></li>
<li><p>Have I read the library books? I kept it by my bed in hope that I’d read it before sleep.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write a sonnet? I did! It was kind of about my research, which is nice.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I revise a sonnet? I really need to learn how to do this.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? Look at this blog post! Extant</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write ahead on Jeb? I finished the chapter due today and started the chapter due wednesday, so kind of, at least.</p></li>
<li><p>Letter to friends? Nope!</p></li>
<li><p>Paper? Realized I messed up a bunch of calculations, which is kind of sad.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Wellness</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How well did I pray? Not well. I fell asleep before starting a rosary last night.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I clean my space? A little</p></li>
<li><p>Did I spend my time well? I tried. I focused too hard on research and lost track of time, which probably isn’t a bad thing.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? No</p></li>
<li><p>Did I exercise? I did the bare minimum, which I’m counting as enough.</p></li>
<li><p>Water? I didn’t drink enough water, but I tried to. It’s hard when I don’t fill my water bottles often enough. Things to think about I guess.</p></li>

<h1 id="reflections-on-todays-gospel"><a href="reflections-on-readings-1-advent-b-23.html">Reflections on Today’s Gospel</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 December 3</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>One line in particular stuck out to me in today’s readings. In the first reading, the Prophet Isaiah says that “we are the clay and you are the potter.”<a href="#fn011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Now, my mind immediately leapt to two ways that this can be interpreted.</p>
<p>First, despite the way that most modern people interact with clay, it does not come to us perfectly pure and ready to be used. Instead, it has to be refined more or less depending on the soil that it is in. We, the people of G-d are clay. Much like last week’s metaphor of sheep and goats, we can point to that in contrast to the silt and sand of sinfulness.</p>
<p>Once clay is gathered, however, it is rarely simply formed and fired. Nearly every culture has a tradition of incorporating dust from a previous, often failed<a href="#fn012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> project. It is at this point that I feel the need to reflect on the different “we’s” that the Prophet could be referring to.</p>
<p>First, we could mean each of us individually. We are all lovingly and perfectly shaped by G-d our Father. However, even as we are shaped, we are not alone. Pottery is a fundamentally useful craft. It creates objects to be used with others. Similarly, whatever the Almighty shapes us into, it is meant to relate to the rest of the world in some way.</p>
<p>Additionally, we are not the first to be born. Prayers from those before have their positive effects, like the powdered pieces of a previous project. Or, just as it is easier to shape a new pot once you’ve made an older one, it is also easier to find the Lord when your parents have known Him.</p>
<p>Of course, we could also be referring to the entire People of G-d. We are each a small piece of the clay in the pot of creation that the Lord forms. In that regard, the fragments of old pieces can be thought of as the parts of ourselves and our cultures we bring from times before Christ.</p>
<p>Nearly every Parish I’ve visited uses an evergreen wreath to hold its Advent candles. Why?</p>
<p>Of course, there’s the obvious answer of “we’ve always done it that way, and it’s pretty,” but of course, we can not have always always done it a certain way. Someone had to be first.<a href="#fn013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Some among you might know that we took the concept of the Christmas tree from Germanic Pagans, for whom evergreen trees were a reminder that the depths of winter would pass. That sentiment lead us to using the same for Advent wreaths.</p>
<p>There was a truth in the pagan tribes that still resonates with the Church today. G-d who fashioned the entire universe can be seen in all that He has created. The beauty of evergreen boughs, especially in contrast to the white of winter, reminds us of so many different truths. In such a way, the beneficial parts of pre-Christian lives and cultures can enrich the lives of the faithful, just as the advent wreath enriches many believers’ Advents.<a href="#fn014" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I embroider today? Yes! It’s been fun, and I got to spend like an hour working with friends, which was really great. I know one of my goals this year was to grow closer to the people I care about, and I think that this helped.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I play guitar today? Once again, a scale and my etude were the majority of what I played.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I practice touch typing today? I did a few lessons. It’s fun for me to see that I lose almost all of my progress each day whenever I log back on. I think that if I did more lessons I would probably lose less between days. Eh.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Reading</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have I made progress on my Currently Reading Shelf? I read maybe 3 minutes today, which isn’t great, but today passed by so much faster than I thought it would.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I read the book on craft? I decided to take the day of from reading the book on craft, because it’s Sunday.</p></li>
<li><p>Have I read the library books? Last night I read a chapter. It was really interesting, and I’m excited to see where the rest of the book develops.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write a sonnet? Did it! I think I’m doing better at imagery and stopping myself from writing into a corner with bad rhymes.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I revise a sonnet? I still don’t know if I actually know how to revise a sonnet.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? Woo! I did it.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write ahead on Jeb? I think that I’m still comfortable saying that I won’t work on Jeb on Sundays, for all that I know that means tomorrow morning I’ll need to panic write.</p></li>
<li><p>Letter to friends? I did not. It’s in my fanny pack, though, which means that I can in theory write it whenever.</p></li>
<li><p>Paper? It’s Sunday so I will not be doing work.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Wellness</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How well did I pray? Not great. Went to Mass and did a rosary last night, both of which are good.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I clean my space? No.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I spend my time well? I think mostly! I had a day full of seeing people, and the content I consumed was mostly content that I intentionally chose</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? I went diving! Which counts as both stretching and exercise in my book.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I exercise? See above.</p></li>
<li><p>Water? Drank a bunch during and before Mass because I needed to sing. After that, though, I have not been doing a great job remaining hydrated.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Happy new year! I was reminded today<a href="#fn015" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> that this year is the shortest possible advent at three weeks and one day.<a href="#fn016" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> That’s not really relevant to the rest of this reflection, but it’s an interesting fact nonetheless.</p>
<p>Advent is the beginning of the liturgical year. It is a time of preparation and reflection before the celebration of the coming of our Savior. Of course, as is often brought up, Christmas only has meaning because of Easter.</p>
<p>Yesterday’s first draft talked about iconoclasm and its opposite. Every year, I feel a little more frustrated at the state of discourse surrounding Christmas and its accompanying rituals. These days, both sides of the extremes<a href="#fn017" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> claim that such beloved traditions as Christmas trees are inherently pagan. Of course, there is truth to that claim, at least.<a href="#fn018" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Christmas trees were, as reported by the early Church, used in Germanic pagan winter solstice celebrations.<a href="#fn019" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> However, just as music can bring people to the Almighty, and just as people and nations can be baptized, the Church in her glory recognized that rituals can serve to help lead us to Christ. The Church never claims to be the only place that truth is found, just the best. Anyways, all this to say, there is nothing wrong with remembering that life will come again and that winter will come to an end.</p>
<p>Today’s readings remind us that everything will come to an end. Christ compares His second coming to a man returning from a voyage abroad. However, the Gospel is not where I want to focus tonight.</p>
<p>Instead, I would like to focus on a single line from the first reading. “We are the clay and you are the potter.”<a href="#fn0110" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Now, when I think of clay today, I think of it almost exclusively in an artistic context. What little I’ve worked with clay has come from prepared and purchased material of high purity.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is not how all clay has been gathered throughout history. Clay can be gathered from nearly any soil, though some soil obviously has more or less clay in it than others. It needs to be separated from the silt and the sand that also makes up soil. I’m sure that someone wiser than me could connect that to the metaphor of sheep and goats from last week, but I can’t seem to make the leap tonight.</p>
<p>The other piece of pottery lore that I remember right now is that nearly every culture has a tradition of incorporating a small portion of an already fired work into new clay. There are some really interesting materials reasons for it, and indeed, having a small amount of reused clay improves the final product. Now, depending on what we means<a href="#fn0111" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>, I can connect that to the reading.</p>
<p>Assuming we refers to each of us as individuals, it can be a reference to the fact that it’s easier to find the Truth if you are raised in a family who believes.<a href="#fn0112" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> It is not essential however, which is part of where the Church’s mission to convert the entire world comes in.</p>
<p>If we refers to the People of G-d, then the pieces of prefired clay are traditions like Christmas trees and gift giving. We are able to most fully express our love for the Almighty not by turning away from absolutely every part of our old life, but by baptizing and purifying everything we do. The best pot is formed by taking parts from a pot that did not work. Similarly, the best culture<a href="#fn0113" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> is not created from new cloth entirely, but incorporates parts of the previous.</p>
<p>I don’t know if that’s at all coherent, but it resonates with me. Probably worth revising and seeing if I can’t make it a little better.</p>

<h1 id="on-adoration"><a href="adoration.html">On Adoration</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 December 2</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>As far as I can tell, I’ve never mused about adoration on this blog. Matching the times in my life that I’ve blogged to the times in my life that I have gone to adoration, I suppose that there isn’t a lot of overlap. Last night, however,<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I went to my parish’s monthly young adult adoration event.</p>
<p>It was a really nice experience. I feel like every time that I just sit in a church and pray for an hour, my life suddenly seems much better. Modern psychology supports that idea, calling it meditation, and I don’t want to discount the value of just unplugging and focusing on where I am in the moment for a little bit. However, I’ve also gotten to the point in my life where I really do want to start exploring the spiritual side of my faith more. There’s more to prayer than simple meditation, and there’s something special about praying in front of Christ truly present.</p>
<p>Last night’s meditation was about the value of hope. For all that the priest demurred and said that anything insightful or thoughtful he said came from one of the great thinkers he cited in his talk, it was still a fantastic reflection and meditation. Hope is something that I’ve been struggling with lately. The priest connected hope to prayer, reminding us that to pray more is to become better at praying, and to pray better. I cannot remember exactly how he connected them, but I remember that it made sense at the time. One line that I do really strongly remember is him pointing out that when we pray together, as in Mass or even in that moment, it is not just a bunch of people individually praying. It is that, of course, but it is also so much more profound, for all that I cannot remember the exact words he used that resonated with me so strongly. During adoration, I found that my mind slowed down for the first time in what felt like months. It was not the muffled silence of my thoughts being drowned out by earthly distractions. Nor was I struggling to piece together fragments of a shattered idea from behind a murky window. Instead, I simply was there, and I was at rest.</p>
<p>I was advised to read Psalm 118 last night, and it is an absolutely beautiful Psalm.<a href="#fn022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> I think that helped me to focus my prayers in a more uplifting and positive direction, rather than the negative spirals I’ve tended to start falling into. There’s so much going wrong in the world right now that it can be hard to remain hopeful.</p>
<p>Of course, as the apologetics book I’m reading points out, hope and optimism are not synonyms. They can be as linked or unlinked as any other two traits. I’ve been trying to keep that in mind.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I embroider today? I decided that I’ll take today off from embroidery, especially since the initial goal was just doing it more often.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I play guitar today? Yes! I played a quick few scales and did my normal warm-up etude.<a href="#fn023" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Did I practice touch typing today? I did a few lessons. For some reason, I keep struggling with my letter t. I’m allegedly working on learning y, but have to keep going back to try t again.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Reading</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have I made progress on my Currently Reading Shelf? Yes! I finished one of the books and then pulled back up the oldest book on my currently reading shelf<a href="#fn024" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Did I read the book on craft? I read a bit more of writing well and have started to get to the point that I’m starting to feel a disconnect between what they’re saying and what I’ve found to be true. They say you write like you read, and the writing I want to do is the pulp fiction that I read, but that has a very different style than what they recommend. Still, I suppose that it’s worthwhile to try, if only because learning how to write in a formal register cannot help but aid me as I work on my thesis, even if it doesn’t necessarily help with the fun writing I do.</p></li>
<li><p>Have I read the library books? I did not do this yesterday, which is a bit of a shame. Once I post my musing, though, I will absolutely do so.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write a sonnet? Woo! Just cranked one out. It was spooky and winter themed, which is always nice.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I revise a sonnet? I need to learn how to do this.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? Look at this, revised and everything.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write ahead on Jeb? Now that NaNo is over, I’m not sure if I’m going to keep up on the no Jeb on Sundays rule. Mostly, the issue is that right now I feel very tired, and I’ve only written about 400 words.</p></li>
<li><p>Letter to friends? Nope! I might have time tomorrow, though<a href="#fn025" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Paper? I downloaded the latest set of computations,<a href="#fn026" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> and will probably make time to look at them sometime soon.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Wellness</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How well did I pray? Badly. I got home a little late last night, and so didn’t make it through a rosary. Slept through most of the afternoon which also didn’t help.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I clean my space? Only for a few minutes, but I did my best. I think that I’m slowly getting ahead of entropy, which is my only real goal.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I spend my time well? I spent a little more time on instagram and youtube than I wanted, but by and large I think so. I woke up at my standard weekday time and volunteered at a concession stand, where I did some reading and chatted with a friend. After that, it was home to eat, sleep, and then go lift.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? I did! After lifting. I’m very tight.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I exercise? I did a long leg workout with a friend that did not go well in the slightest.</p></li>
<li><p>Water? Absolutely not enough, as evidenced by the lift going so poorly. Still, I have hope that I will feel better if I drink more for the rest of the night. Update: I’ve continued to drink more water since coming home and do, in fact, feel better.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As far as I can tell, I’ve never mused about adoration on this blog before. Thinking about the times of my life that I’ve written this blog, though, I suppose it makes sense. I don’t think that I went to adoration a single time while abroad, and it wasn’t something I sought out while in undergraduate either.<a href="#fn027" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> It was mostly something reserved for the occasional youth retreat.</p>
<p>As an older and more cynical person, I do respect how well the youth retreats I went to were scheduled. They encouraged us to just the right level of sleep deprivation and exhaustion where the final Mass would always feel that much more impactful. There’s a trend in modern Christianity to say that the emotional experience you feel in a situation like that is the only valid religious experience. That, of course, is wrong.</p>
<p>Definitionally, not every moment can be a highlight. At some point, our minds and bodies adapt to the situation we are in, treating the average as a new baseline. This is the same issue that creates addictions and overdoses, and can be just as harmful to our spiritual lives.<a href="#fn028" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>As a result, there’s another trend in modern Christianity<a href="#fn029" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> that says that the emotional experience doesn’t matter at all. People in this camp, I’ve found at least, tend to be very dismissive of praise and worship music and most of the new Catholic hymnody of the early post Vatican II era.<a href="#fn0210" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Their argument is that the music is too sentimental and sappy.</p>
<p>That’s also clearly wrong. We are creatures made with body and soul. As a music major, the majority of what I learned about Trent<a href="#fn0211" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> is from a musical perspective.</p>
<p>One of the major controversies in the early Protestant era<a href="#fn0212" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> was a belief that the robust and intense polyphony and rich instrumentation of Mass settings of the era were bad. They felt the same about most of sacred art.</p>
<p>Interestingly, both sides framed most of their arguments on the average illiterate peasant, rather than the people actually writing the arguments. Luther himself said that the hymns he wrote should be used for laborers.<a href="#fn0213" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> The Catholic position was<a href="#fn0214" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> that G-d is Beauty<a href="#fn0215" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>. To see beautiful things cannot help but bring us closer, in some way, to the source of all beauty Himself.</p>
<p>The early Protestant position is less unified, and more or less says the same thing that all iconoclasts say. Earthly beauty is bad, because it makes us focus on earth, rather than G-d.<a href="#fn0216" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> Because of the intense push back, the Catholic Church did strongly consider restricting or banning polyphony. In the end, though, the Holy Spirit won<a href="#fn0217" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>, and polyphony was maintained in this Church.</p>
<p>Now, I’m sure that you’re all wondering whether the reason I have a whole diversion on how interesting the Church’s relationship with art, especially music, and especially early music, is is because I have a degree focused on early music.<a href="#fn0218" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> In part, yes. In part, though, it’s the same tension that we have today.</p>
<p>G-d is Beauty, Love, Truth, and Goodness. While the reverse is not true, and something beautiful is not inherently divine, there is a part of us that is always reaching out for the Divine. Especially in situations like the Mass, taking advantage of the fact that we can, in fact, use emotion to make people holier is a good thing that I think Churches should do. Of course, as with all things, it needs to be a careful balance. The music can never become the goal in itself, which is where the iconoclasts are right. However, denying the part of our divinely created and inspired souls and bodies that seeks music and beauty is just as wrong.</p>
<p>Tying this back to the actual post, I don’t think that there’s anything wrong with the planners for youth retreats putting the most spiritually important moments at the places that we were most primed to receive them. That’s just good catechesis, leading people and helping them to be as open to the Truth as possible. But, how does this all relate to adoration?</p>
<p>Adoration, in case any of my readers don’t know, in this context refers to the Catholic practice of praying in front of the Blessed Sacrament.<a href="#fn0219" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> Often, the Host is placed into an ornate golden frame on the altar. Some songs written by Thomas Aquinas are commonly sung at the beginning and end of the time, and the middle portion is usually reserved for silent prayer. In the diocese I’m currently at, most Parishes seem to try to schedule opportunities for Confession during adoration hours.</p>
<p>I’m realizing now that I haven’t been sure whether I want to write about adoration generally or my experience at adoration last night. I’ve been trying to split the difference, which is probably the worst version of each. I think that right now I want to reflect solely on last night’s reflection, so on to draft two I suppose.<a href="#fn0220" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<h1 id="flash-fiction-friday"><a href="flash-fiction-229.html">Flash Fiction Friday</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 December 1</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>It’s another Friday, which means that it’s time for another edition of “I try to do Flash Fiction Friday”! This week, the friend I did NaNo with is joining, which should be fun. The theme is nebulous roads.</p>
<p>My initial thought, as always happens when there’s a word immediately preceding roads, is to do a parody of John Denver’s seminal work. I’ll keep the fun part of that energy in mind as I work on the actual project, for all that I don’t know quite what I’m going to do. I know that I need to do a sonnet today, so there’s a voice in my head that says I should work on a sonnet, and I might as well let that voice win for at least a little while. Unlike normal, where I hand write sonnets, today I’m going to try typing it out.<a href="#fn031" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>What are nebulous roads? The prompt suggests they could be real roads that are obscured by fog as easily as they could be roads that do not, strictly speaking, exist.</p>
<p>I find that I am drawn to the idea of a desire path right now. They aren’t roads in the strictest sense, instead being passages worn by the repeated choice of people to take a shortcut. Most of the time, they are not a function of a single person. The single exception is probably on fresh snow. The way that a clear night on fresh snow looks is something completely unique and almost ethereal, and that feels like a good place to start.</p>
<p>One draft of a sonnet through, I already remember why I don’t always write in sonnet form. For all that it’s nice to have something so rigid, I do really like the option to have triple meter. There’s absolutely a part of me begging to delve into the fact that even time is now considered the standard, while in early music, triple meter was considered the perfect version. That’s too far from the prompt, though, so that lecture will be reserved for another day.</p>
<p>The rest of the day passed far too quickly, and so I will not be revising the sonnet again.</p>
<p>I think something that could be helpful for me<a href="#fn032" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, given how long the daily reflection is, is to go through the list often throughout the day, so I have more reminders.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I embroider today? I did! I did a few rows which was nice.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I play guitar today? I did! I played a few scales and did some warmups. Not very much, though, because I did it first thing in the morning and was tired.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I practice touch typing today? I did! Didn’t do a great job, but I tried, and that’s the only really important part.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Reading</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have I made progress on my Currently Reading Shelf? Yes! I read about a chapter.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I read the book on craft? I’ve chosen to read “Writing Well Ninth Edition” by Donald Hall and Sven Birkerts. It’s a fantastic book, and I’m in love with it from the first pages.</p></li>
<li><p>Have I read the library books? Not yet, but probably will when I post this.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write a sonnet? I did! As you might guess from the fact that I blogged about it, I wrote on the theme of ethereal roads.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I revise a sonnet? I revised as I wrote, but I still don’t know if I really know how to revise one generally. Probably worth asking my poetry friend.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? Look at this fun little blog!</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write ahead on Jeb? I finished the chapter this morning, which was nice.</p></li>
<li><p>Letter to friends? Nope!</p></li>
<li><p>Paper? Looked at some fun data!</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Wellness</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How well did I pray? I remembered to start the day with prayer, even if last night’s rosary wasn’t great. I then went to adoration for an hour which was nice.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I clean my space? I did! I went for the lowest hanging fruit.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I spend my time well? So far I have, but the day is mostly begun, so doesn’t really count yet.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? I did! This morning, which is nice.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I exercise? I did a pushup and a body weight squat which is good.</p></li>
<li><p>Water? Not enough.</p></li>

<h1 id="monthly-reflection"><a href="reflection-november-23.html">Monthly Reflection</a></h1>
<p>First Written: 2023 November 30</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Wow! Another month has passed me by. This month didn’t feel like it disappeared in a blink like the past few have, which is really nice.</p>
<p>I feel like I’ve grown as a person and in some of my interpersonal relationships, which is always really nice. It was a really chill month in many regards, if only because the only travel I did was for family reasons, rather than anything even slightly professional.</p>
<p>Relevant/notable things I did this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Started writing my first first author paper.<a href="#fn041" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Started playing DnD again</p></li>
<li><p>Got sick</p></li>
<li><p>Ran into friends from the past and present at random and unexpected places.<a href="#fn042" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Got auctioned off!<a href="#fn043" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Saw 12th night again!</p></li>
<li><p>Solo taught my first class</p></li>
<li><p>Had Thanksgiving with my family!</p></li>
<li><p><a href="nanowrimo-6.html">Did NaNoWriMo for the second time!</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s see how that lines up with my predictions for the month.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Going home for Thanksgiving. I did that, and I’m glad I knew it would be notable.</p></li>
<li><p>Doing NaNoWriMo with a friend. It’s been really fun to write with the friend, and it sounds like we’re planning to continue our morning writing sessions!<a href="#fn044" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I’m guest teaching a class, which is fun. It was fun! I don’t know if I did a great job, but I didn’t get an angry email or letter about it, so I assume that I did well enough. I suppose we’ll find out in the future.</p></li>
<li><p>I’m going to a cool discussion about Pascal. I ended up being too sick on the day of the talk, which is sad. I guess I did put that I got sick, so at least I have the event that ended up replacing it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s always nice when I actually do the things that I planned on doing<a href="#fn045" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. It’s even nicer when I also do things that are fun that I did not know I would be doing. Now that we’ve gone through the discrete events, let’s see how we did on the monthly goals for October. I always feel a little like I’ve let myself down when I go through my monthly goals, which is a fun thing to reflect on. It’s interesting that I continually think that I will suddenly be able to do things that I demonstrably have not been able to do. With that disclaimer<a href="#fn046" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> out of the way, let’s see what we wanted to do, did, and how that overlapped. I’ll delete commentary in the initial goals, except where I want to comment on them in reflection.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Write 1700 words a day for my NaNo project.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a chapter of Jeb every day.</p></li>
<li><p>Blog every day.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch every day.</p></li>
<li><p>Improve the cleanliness of my home.</p></li>
<li><p>Pray better</p></li>
<li><p>Write letters to friends. At a minimum, there are three people I owe a letter to and at least one other person I would like to send a letter to. We’re almost at the time of year that holiday cards become appropriate, and I could consider doing those this year.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Honestly, I did much better than I thought I would. I’m not sure if I suddenly learned how to set reasonable goals or if I just had an unusually good month, but either way:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Until yesterday, I did this with flying colors. I averaged about 1765 words a day, with minimal variance. I never went above 1800 and never went below 1745 words. Yesterday, I made the intentional choice to finish the book, rather than write an extra 3000 words, and I’m comfortable with intentionally changing my goals.</p></li>
<li><p>I didn’t do great on this. I managed to pull really far ahead in the early days of the month, and then immediately stopped writing more or less at all, and ended up with as much of a backlog as I began. That’s a little bit of a shame, but I do think that I’ll have an easier time writing in the upcoming months, since I now have the book plotted out at least a little.</p></li>
<li><p>With one exception, I wrote a blog every day this month. It’s nice to have a record of what I was thinking about for at least a little bit of each day this past month.</p></li>
<li><p>I stretched more than I did in October, but still not daily. I do feel like I’ve started to be more aware of my posture when I write, though, and I do sometimes even catch myself slouching too far over and sit up a little straighter.</p></li>
<li><p>I don’t quite remember what my home looked like at the start of the month. I think it’s a little better than then, but not markedly so. That’s probably a goal that’s worth having again, if only because I do want to start to clean my home. I’m a little surprised that I didn’t put it in my daily reflections. I’m sure there’s a reason for that, but I can’t remember why right now.</p></li>
<li><p>I don’t know if I would say that I have started praying better. I think maybe a little. It’s definitely a goal I want to focus on even more this month.</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote the three letters to friends, I think. Holiday cards still remain an option, and have the benefit of me being able to write the same letter, more or less by rote. Honestly, I could just type and print out the letters, but that feels kind of sad. I know that I greatly prefer hand written letters to typed form letters.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s now shift from facing backwards to looking forwards. This month, I am excited for:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Consequences of the auction<a href="#fn047" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Getting better at prose</p></li>
<li><p>Going home for Christmas</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Welp, the list is shorter once again. This is not because I do not plan on doing anything, but rather because I have much of the month open, which I’m excited for. It’ll be fun to see what ends up filling my hours.</p>
<p>Goals for the upcoming month:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Finish at least three of the books that have been sitting maligned on my “Currently Reading” shelf. There’s an app I use to keep track of my reading. This past summer I set the admirable goal of cleaning it out. Of course, that did not happen. Moving forward, though, I would like to start doing that.</p></li>
<li><p>On a related note, read two of the books that I’ve checked out from the library. If I divide the number of books I have checked out by the number months I expect to have left in the graduate program, I get a number I don’t like. There are absolutely some books that I’ve checked out to use as the occasional reference, rather than to read fully through. They are, however, in the minority. I would like to start spending more of my time intentionally, and part of that means reading more books to grow as a person, rather than just fluff to fill the hours.</p></li>
<li><p>Following that line of thought, I want to spend my time more intentionally. I know that I have a bad habit of just letting life pass me by, getting distracted by random things on my computer or phone. I would like to not do that</p></li>
<li><p>I want to write a sonnet every day. My poetry friend suggested that writing lots of sonnets was the best way that he knew to improve at writing meter. There was an implication within it that I should, or at least might want to consider revising the poems as well. I still don’t really know how to workshop and revise poetry, especially fixed forms like the sonnet. That could be a fun learning experience.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to read a book on the craft of writing start to finish. I know that this really bumps up the number of books that I’m going to try reading, but that’s probably ok. I like to read, and I’m getting faster at reading again. Then again, most of the books I have as reading goals this month are not beach reads, which might mean that trying to read them too quickly is a bad idea. Still, we’ll do whatever feels right.</p></li>
<li><p>Get better at prayer. Reading the book on apologetics is making me realize just how much I do still think of prayer as an emotional, rather than will-based experience. I think that shifting my mental conception might be really helpful</p></li>
<li><p>Clean my home. It’s at a point right now that I think I could leave it almost perfect when I go to visit family for the holidays. It would be really nice to be able to come back to something clean, and that’s a great motivator.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch and do some other form of exercise every day. Even if it’s just a few pushups and a few situps, I want to get in shape. I have friends who I can, in theory at least, lift with. And, I do really value stretching.</p></li>
<li><p>Get better at touch typing. There’s a website I found which slowly introduces you to more letters as you learn them, so that you can start to rebuild the muscle memory of where fingers go and what letters belong to each of them.</p></li>
<li><p>Write letters to friends. I have a bunch of people I’d like to write a letter to.<a href="#fn048" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Get ahead on Jeb. Ideally, I would like to be five chapters ahead at the end of the year.<a href="#fn049" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Get better at embroidery. I’ve allegedly started to learn, but I want to spend at least a little time every few days. Then again, the best way to build a habit is daily. Maybe doing like a strand a day would be a good idea, at least until I go home for break</p></li>
<li><p>Play guitar every day. I want to start recording an album soon. I need to be able to play the music on it. Even if it’s just a few chords and a scale, I want to get back into guitar. Replacing the strings will probably help with that.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to keep up the daily blogging. That seems like an easy enough goal.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to finish a full draft of the paper I’m working on. Without having finished that, I feel like I’ll have no way of knowing when, exactly, I’ve finished the research for the paper.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to drink more water. I’ve been pretty dehydrated lately.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So, that’s a very ambitious set of goals. Let’s see what we can do for a daily reflection in a way that isn’t going to be a full musing in and of itself every day. I’m going to move some items around so that like elements are closer in daily reflection, as opposed to being in the more or less stream of consciousness order that they are right now. I think that a part of me thinks that higher items on the daily reflection reflect my own internal belief that it’s more important to hit the goals. I don’t know if that’s true. I’m changing enough this month that I don’t know if I really want to also add priorities. It might be fun to do nested lists. I’ll see if that works. Items this month will be in the order that I remember/find them in the list.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I embroider today?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I play guitar today?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I practice touch typing today?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Reading</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have I made progress on my Currently Reading Shelf?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I read the book on craft?</p></li>
<li><p>Have I read the library books?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write a sonnet?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I revise a sonnet?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write ahead on Jeb?</p></li>
<li><p>Letter to friends?</p></li>
<li><p>Paper?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Wellness</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How well did I pray?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I clean my space?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I spend my time well?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I exercise?</p></li>
<li><p>Water?</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Oof, that’s enough different items that I had to double check my list repeatedly to make sure that I didn’t miss anything. Still, I think that I’m at a place right now where I’d rather aim high and fall short than try to meet small goals. We’ll see if I still feel that way in the middle of the month.</p>
<p>Looking forward, I do want to start composing again, as I have mentioned. In January, I think that I would like to start doing a small composition exercise every day, but I suppose I’ll see how I feel at the end of December.<a href="#fn0410" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Since I’m currently writing this post at the beginning of the day, I will wait to do the daily reflection until the end of the day. That also means that I’ll wait to post this until the end of the day, which might mean that I end up coming up with a second draft as I have different ideas for what, exactly, I want to spend next month doing. Just sitting here, I’ve found that the list has grown a lot in the past hour, which is nice and a little terrifying.</p>
<p>Coming back to the post at the end of the night, I didn’t really have much to add, which is nice. Time for my last November daily reflection!</p>

<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb? I wrote about half of one, which I think is enough for tonight. I’m ok with going to bed a little earlier instead of writing a little more.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? I like today’s blog. It does what the musings are supposed to do, which is refocus me.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? I did end up stretching after posting last night’s musing. Will do so after this one.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing better at prayer than a rushed and thoughtless rosary? I did not make it very well focused last night. Maybe tonight. If not, I guess I’m still trying, which is worth something.</p></li>

<h1 id="nanowrimo-2023-retrospective"><a href="nanowrimo-6.html">NaNoWriMo 2023 Retrospective</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 November 29</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Wow! I did it! One day early and sixty two words over, I have officially completed NaNoWriMo number 25.<a href="#fn051" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Having now finished the story, I feel like now might be a great time to do a post mortem on the process.</p>
<p>I think that breaking it into pros, cons, and things I noted is probably a great way to do it. I’m not sure if I want to do it in a list wise fashion or as they pop up, but it’s probably a good idea to do lists, if only because I don’t have to write each word successively<a href="#fn052" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> and the three categories seem useful to me. The good, bad, and ugly, is another way to frame this.</p>
<p>First, the good:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I got to spend a lot of time writing with a friend. We tried to meet up daily, but that was a very soft goal. Still, I think that we ended up meeting up at least half of the days this past month, including twice online.<a href="#fn053" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> I really enjoy parallel play<a href="#fn054" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>, especially with this friend, and I hope that we continue to do something similar in the future, for all that I know that it will be different now that NaNo is over. I also know that I had a much easier time simply letting bad words flow onto a page than my friend did, and I worry that it might have been discouraging to write next to me.</p></li>
<li><p>I proved that I can, in fact, write a full<a href="#fn055" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> story in the course of a month. Even while juggling writing this blog every day, keeping up<a href="#fn056" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> on Jeb, and doing my other writing in a day, I was able to keep the narrative in mind. This is my second NaNoWriMo, but last year I think that I ended up finishing the story I wanted to tell in less than fifty thousand words, so I had to extend it past where was natural. I nearly had the same issue this year, because I had two days left in the month but only 500 words left to write to hit fifty thousand. Deciding what I meant by doing NaNo was a difficult choice, but I’m glad I chose to have it mean that I wrote 50k, rather than wrote explicitly the book every day in November.</p></li>
<li><p>I got to explore writing a more explicitly faith based narrative. For all that I know I could have done a much better job of it,<a href="#fn057" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> I enjoyed writing something that took place in the real world, where the Church exists, and where I could frame the Church as a good, if often human, institution. I don’t know if urban fantasy will forever be the genre for me, but especially since I have historically read a lot of it, there’s no reason for me to think that I won’t continue to do it at least a little.</p></li>
<li><p>I got lots of practice with first person. Almost everything else I write is in a third person so limited as to be almost first person, but the explicit difference is nice. I think that I could have been more intentional about the form, but I think that what intention I did use was nice.</p></li>
<li><p>I got to practice plotting and then following the<a href="#fn058" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> plot. I found that setting a loose story goal early on and then filling it in each day before writing worked really well. I might do something similar with Jeb, since I currently have the one sentence part.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The less good:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I think that the book idea I had was better served as something that I wrote slowly and thoughtfully, rather than in the fairly rushed way that NaNo requires and expects. I don’t really have anything to add to this.</p></li>
<li><p>I don’t know if it’s that, or if it’s something else, but I didn’t really love the book. It might have been better as a short story. For all that it was a cool premise, the one sentence synopsis of the book<a href="#fn059" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> was really about as good as I ever got. I don’t really know if anything I did in the book deserves a longer one.</p></li>
<li><p>I don’t think that I did a good job writing in first person. I think that I struggle to put thoughts to page in a cogent fashion, and that absolutely came up here. I couldn’t keep the character’s thoughts separate from what mine would be in the situation, not that I really tried.</p></li>
<li><p>I think that I used a lot of cliches and did far more telling than showing, to the detriment of the story.</p></li>
<li><p>I don’t think that I did a good job reflecting my faith in a positive way. The Catholicism was for more surface level to the story than I would have wanted.<a href="#fn0510" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The things I noticed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Every day it was far harder to start writing than to actually write. I ended up adopting the motto of “the only way out is through and the only way through is forward,” which I typed at the end of each day’s plotting session.</p></li>
<li><p>People get surprised when you tell them that you’re doing NaNoWriMo, far more than when you tell them you have a blog or put out a web serial. Not sure what’s up with that.</p></li>
<li><p>I have trouble writing specific sensory cues. This ties into the next item, so I’ll talk about it more there.</p></li>
<li><p>I became much more aware of the way that books I read this past month were written. The biggest difference between my writing and more or less everything I read was the sensory cues.</p>
<p>There’s a concept of how well someone can visualize something in their mind. It’s a spectrum, as so many abilities are. At one end of the spectrum are people who can close their eyes and see the world in, if anything, fuller color than with their eyes open. At the other end, there are people who see nothing when they close their eyes.</p>
<p>I’ve always considered myself more on the former end of that spectrum. However, as this month has progressed, I’ve begun to realize that there’s a difference between what I can do and what I do do.<a href="#fn0511" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Visualizing takes mental effort for me. When I don’t put forth the effort, things do exist in a void.</p>
<p>Obviously, this shines through in my writing. Without meaning to, I simply elide through physical descriptors, simply because they are not relevant to the scene at hand. It’s something that a lot of commenters have noticed in my web serial, which is likely one reason that I have noticed it myself. I know it’s something that I should work on, especially if I want to really improve my craft.</p>
<p>I don’t know quite how to fix it, so that’s probably going to be one of the priorities in the coming months</p></li>
<li><p>I realized that I have finally shifted from being limited by the speed I can compose content in my brain to the speed that I can type. It’s kind of fun that the rate limiting step for me is now my ability to actually type.</p>
<p>Related enough that it doesn’t get its own entry, I’ve realized that I don’t actually know how to touch type properly. I’ve decided to start actually learning for real, which will hopefully go well.</p></li>
<li><p>Having one writing project makes doing other writing projects easier. There are flavors of productive procrastination to this, but I do really think that a large part of it is that once I’ve written one thing in a day, the next thing I need to write is easier because I don’t have to convince myself that I like writing before beginning the next one.<a href="#fn0512" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>A consequence of becoming more comfortable writing is that I am becoming less and less satisfied with the way that I write, even as I start getting more external praise for the writing. I don’t know if this is a “we’re near the move from conscious incompetence to conscious competence,” thing or just a “I’m now good enough that I see how much room I have to grow”, or what, but it’s kind of fun. I think that the main gripe I have with my writing right now is that it’s rambly. As I mentioned recently, I’m going to start working on craft in the upcoming months, and I hope that one consequence of that will be words that taste better not just one by one, but when taken as a whole.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Now that I’ve done a quick and dirty reflection of how I feel about my NaNo this year, I’ll go through some of the questions that I can imagine being asked about doing it<a href="#fn0513" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What is NaNoWriMo? National Novel Writer’s Month. It’s every November since 1999. The goal is to write a full<a href="#fn0514" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> novel in the span of the month.</p></li>
<li><p>How did you come up with your story idea?<a href="#fn0515" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> I read a text post somewhere talking about dos and don’ts for including the Catholic Church in a work of fiction, especially urban fantasy, and was inspired.</p></li>
<li><p>How did you feel about it?<a href="#fn0516" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> See above.</p></li>
<li><p>Why did you choose to do this? Great question!<a href="#fn0517" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> I think that really I wanted to try to stretch myself this year.</p></li>
<li><p>Do you plan to do anything with the novel?<a href="#fn0518" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> Probably not, at least for the foreseeable future. While I think that there’s something worth salvaging in the book, it’s deep beneath a lot of crud I’ll need to clean up, and I don’t know that I want to do that right now. I have the rest of my life, though<a href="#fn0519" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>How do you do it? I have gotten good at sitting down in front of a computer and just typing. I find that it helps to have a minute or so of free journaling at the start of each writing session, where you just open a new note file and start typing exactly what you’re thinking, then slowly try to redirect your thoughts to the book. At that point, take another minute to quickly plot out what you want to happen, and then start writing.</p>
<p>As an example:</p>
<p>Let’s see, it’s about half past 2000 right now and I don’t really have anything else on my plate today, thankfully. Once I finish this blog post I’m more or less done for the day, though I do need to figure out the title. If I was actually going to be writing right now, I might be doing some planning for a short story I want to write. A reason I don’t want to write is (I don’t have one right now)</p>
<p>I find that writing like that really helps me kill the voice in my head that tries to stop me from typing, for all that the fiction I write is written far less informally.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have other questions, please feel free to ask, and I’ll respond privately. If I feel like it’s worth revising the blog over<a href="#fn0520" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a>, I’ll update it with the new questions. Thanks for following me on this journey! Hopefully this blog will continue.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write 1700 words for NaNoWriMo? I did not today, but I finished NaNo<a href="#fn0521" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> this item gets to be deleted for the next year or so!</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb? I did not finish it last night, but did finish it when I woke up early this morning and couldn’t fall back asleep.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? I feel like today’s was at least a little more coherent.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? Nope!</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing better at prayer than a rushed and thoughtless rosary? I made it through like 2 mysteries last night without getting distracted, but made it through the full rosary, even if quickly.</p></li>

<h1 id="moving-to-markdown"><a href="to-markdown.html">Moving to Markdown</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 November 28</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Prereading note: Not only is this rambling, but it more or less is three blog posts stapled to each other, each of which was already rambling. I apologize in advance to my readers.</p>
<p>I do not remember exactly why,<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> but I was considering revisiting <a href="footnote-frenzy.html">my post about footnotes</a> today. I spent a fairly long time revisiting many of the same paths that I trod a few years ago when I first set up this blog.<a href="#fn062" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> In the end, I was unable to find any solutions to the issue of creating footnotes within footnotes.</p>
<p>Now, my readers may be interested in having nested footnotes themselves in LaTeX.<a href="#fn063" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> If so, there are a few options.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Be better at writing, and find a solution that does not require having nested footnotes. That seems to be the critical consensus among TeX users, which I find dissatisfying.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the bigfoot package.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Pros: it lets you have arbitrarily deep footnote nests</p></li>
<li><p>Cons: Each nested footnote needs to be a layer deeper, which means that you can’t have like footnote 1 ref 2 ref 3 all on the same level. Given that the only legitimate<a href="#fn064" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> use for nesting is editorializing on translations, that’s probably fine for its use case.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>use \footnotemark within the footnote, and then \footnotetext out of the footnote, which allows you to nest the footnotes. If you use the hyperref package, the footnotes even reference each other like they should.</p></li>
<li><p>Write your own solution. I’m sure that those who know how to use actual computer science would be able to write their own package, should they so choose.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, of these options, I personally find the penultimate to be the best for my use case. I hopefully will not need to have nested footnotes in my actual thesis<a href="#fn065" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>, but if I do, using footnotetext and footnotemark works well enough, and fixes most of my issues pretty quickly. I don’t like having layers of footnotes.</p>
<p>That’s something that’s worth investigating. At a gut level, I feel like multiple layers claim that the point of a footnote is that it’s less important than the main text. I don’t generally agree with that line of thought. I’m bad at expressing thoughts right now,<a href="#fn066" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> but I generally think of the point of most prose, even academic writing, is to convey a narrative. In an academic sense, then, footnotes are used to explain information which is essential to understand a claim but which is not directly essential to the narrative. For instance, if I was discussing how advances in rotational spectroscopy<a href="#fn067" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> allow for better determination of molecular structure, the footnote there could have been nice for someone who might not know what rotational spectroscopy is.<a href="#fn068" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> However, there might be information which is needed to understand the footnote. In the case of my footnote above, it could be useful to explain what quantized transitions are.<a href="#fn069" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Since the footnote level is already for context clues, context to context is still a context clue.<a href="#fn0610" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Anyways, since I cannot have nested footnotes in the current way I’m writing, what can I do instead?</p>
<p>The obvious answer is to ask my father. I did, and learned<a href="#fn0611" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> that he writes his posts in markdown.<a href="#fn0612" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Now, I was initially ready to immediately switch over to writing in markdown.</p>
<p>However, there is an issue. As you might have guessed from the last item in the ways to have nested footnotes, I do not have a great grasp of coding best practices, or practices at all. Readers may wonder how, exactly, I was able to go from TeX to HTML with an automated script, let alone set up an entire blog. To that, I answer, my dear sibling was willing to make the blog set up for me. Since the way I was writing 5 years ago<a href="#fn0613" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> is primarily in TeX, that made the most sense. To switch to markdown,<a href="#fn0614" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> I would need to change up some code in the make file. I don’t know how to do that, so I will need to beg and barter time from a family member who knows how to code, with hope that they will teach me.<a href="#fn0615" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>So, one thousand words into what was supposed to be a quick diversion, I suppose that I should start the actual text of this musing. Maybe I’ll just talk about markdown, which I’d like to learn, I think. It seems to have the benefits of TeX<a href="#fn0616" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> along with being more scalable<a href="#fn0617" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Both are markup languages, which is apparently where the term markdown comes from.<a href="#fn0618" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> Markup languages are just ways of turning plaintext into pretty text. Plain text is<a href="#fn0619" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> anything that you can actually type on your computer. You will notice that there is no bold key on your computer keyboard.<a href="#fn0620" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> In most word processors that my friends interact with,<a href="#fn0621" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> you have to click a button that bolds the text. In a markup language, you would instead do something like (bold) this text (not bold).<a href="#fn0622" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Anyways, that is not where the similarities stop. The main differences between the languages come from the use cases they were created for. LaTeX was built to make TeX more useful. TeX was built because Donald Knuth<a href="#fn0623" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> saw a reprint of one of his books and was fundamentally dissatisfied with how the equations were set on the page. Rather than any of the other solutions one could come up with, he wrote a processor which engraves pretty pages.<a href="#fn0624" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> Given that he was a computer scientist<a href="#fn0625" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> he made it Turing Complete.</p>
<p>What, exactly Turing Completeness is, is not relevant here. The short answer is that if something is Turing Complete, you can make any program in it that you can make in another Turing Complete language. In theory, this does mean that you can program Doom in LaTeX.<a href="#fn0626" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Markdown, by contrast, was written to make writing HTML faster. I vaguely remember hearing that HTML is not Turing Complete, which implies to me that Markdown would not be either. However, as I have repeated constantly, I am not a coder. This is not a relevant issue to me.</p>
<p>Since LaTeX was made for academic publishing usage, it is an incredibly powerful language. By default, it auto-numbers footnotes, has support to automatically make citations in more or less any citation style you like, and so on. When writing an academic paper, which often has a ridiculous number of revisions, number and locations of footnotes do not remain constant. As such, Markdown, which requires directly specifying what footnote a reference refers to, does not satisfice<a href="#fn0627" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> for academic purposes.</p>
<p>Still, for a majority of the writing I do, I do not actually need to cite, or to have autorenumbering footnotes. I also don’t really use equations<a href="#fn0628" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> For the academic writing I do, LaTeX is still superior, so that’s going to be what I stick with. For this blog, and most of the fun writing I do, however<a href="#fn0629" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> Markdown might be the thing for me to switch to.</p>
<p>Eighteen hundred words in, let’s learn Markdown. It’s a very simple language, which will be nice.</p>
<p>To make italicized text, markdown uses either asterisks or underscores on either side of the text.</p>
<p>To make a link, I put the text I want to display in square brackets, followed by the link in parentheses.</p>
<p>To make an ordered list, I have a series of lines where the first begins with 1.<a href="#fn0630" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> Indention makes nested lists.</p>
<p>To make unordered lists, it’s the same as an ordered list, though with dashes, asterisks, or plusses. Best practice is apparently to keep them the same, though that’s not always required.</p>
<p>You can apparently denote code by using quote marks. I’m not totally sure how to make quotes, but that’s hardish in latex.<a href="#fn0631" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>Ooh! I can strikethrough text semi easily in markdown, simply by using two tildes on either side. That’s pretty nifty.</p>
<p>Footnotes!<a href="#fn0632" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> To create a footnote, open bracket, caret, the number of the footnote, close bracket. To create the text for the footnote, the same, but then a colon and the text.</p>
<p>Highlight is double equals sign on either side.</p>
<p>Subscript is single tilde on either side.</p>
<p>Welp, as soon as I have the requisite makefile, and maybe before, I’ll switch over to our good friend markdown!</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write 1700 words for NaNoWriMo? Almost at 50K!</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb? I will finish after this.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? I mean at some point I should stop letting myself just put random words on a page and call it a musing.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? I’m sore at this point, which isn’t great, but I think that I’m less sore than I would have been if I didn’t stretch, so I should do it again today.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing better at prayer than a rushed and thoughtless rosary? I made it through the whole rosary yesterday. It was a little rushed.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing a good job writing letters to friends? I think I’m good getting rid of this goal starting tomorrow, since I don’t really care about it for the next, um, day.</p></li>

<li id="fn061" role="doc-endnote"><p>looking through the text conversations, I think that it was because a friend suggested that I could consider having a substack instead of my current blogging platform, which is, as best as I know, a heartily kludged together mess of so many different things (end result is LaTeX to HTML, with markdown and pandoc in the middle? I think? I don’t really know how to make a makefile, which is such a shame, because wow it would make so much of my life easier.

<h1 id="on-songwriting"><a href="songwriting.html">On Songwriting</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 November 27</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Five years ago today <a href="writing-a-song.html">I mused about writing a song</a>.<a href="#fn071" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Today, I updated my <a href="twenty-five.html">list of goals for the year</a>, and saw again that I wanted to record an album. While I’ve written probably an album’s worth of music, a lot of it is either choral or instrumental in nature.</p>
<p>Some of the choral and instrumental songs<a href="#fn072" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> would work on an album, especially since a few of my pieces<a href="#fn073" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> have been recorded. However, as a person who loves the rock opera<a href="#fn074" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> format, I kind of want there to be a narrative string tying my album together.</p>
<p>Is that demanding far too much of someone who is a Ph. D. candidate<a href="#fn075" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> and has a rich and varied life outside of composing?<a href="#fn076" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Quite possibly. Then again, I find that I, like most people, do best when I feel pushed into my yellow zone.<a href="#fn077" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> I also do want to write an album, for reasons that I don’t know if I’ve explored fully.</p>
<p>I think part of it is that I feel like my musical education is a little too academic. For all that I know a lot about music, and can produce competent music quickly, it kind of feels like a standard I use to judge an artist is whether they’ve created an album. Is that a fair judgement? Probably not.</p>
<p>Is that a prejudice I should investigate inside of myself to see if it really actually resonates with the deeper parts of me? Probably!</p>
<p>Will I? *shrug*</p>
<p>Accepting that elitism/populism<a href="#fn078" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> is not a good enough reason to record an album, why else do I want to?</p>
<p>I’ve had friends ask to listen to my music on Spotify. I have so many moral objections to Spotify as a company, but I don’t know if they neatly overlap with my putting music on the platform. Certainly if my goal is letting my friends listen to the music I’ve written, it’s by far the past of least resistance. I know that more than a few of them refuse to install MP3s<a href="#fn079" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>, and so putting stuff on Spotify would make that accessible to them.</p>
<p>Doing things to please others is not a sufficient condition, nor is it even a necessary condition for doing something, for all that it’s nice.<a href="#fn0710" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Especially since I know I have a tendency towards people pleasing<a href="#fn0711" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>, it’s worth seeing if that’s a good reason.</p>
<p>Let’s take a step back. Rather than thinking about why I, personally, want to write an album, let’s see if I can’t find some reasons that a person somewhere could conceivably want to write an album.<a href="#fn0712" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>As mentioned above: feeling that they need to in order to comfortably call themselves a musician<a href="#fn0713" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Also as mentioned above, pressure from friends.<a href="#fn0714" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Monetary reasons.<a href="#fn0715" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>They feel like the world needs to hear their voice</p></li>
<li><p>Demonstrate musical proficiency</p></li>
<li><p>It seems fun?<a href="#fn0716" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Hold yourself accountable.<a href="#fn0717" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s investigate how they relate to me:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Feelings of inferiority: they apply to me, but I don’t know if that’s a healthy thing. I can get over it either by deciding that I don’t need to write an album to call myself a musician or by writing an album. Probably worth thinking more on whether I should move past that thought generally, for all that making an album will never make me less of a musician.<a href="#fn0718" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Pressure: I think that this is a driving force to me. I’m almost certain that my friends were just being polite when they expressed interest in me recording an album. Nonetheless, I still want them to be able to listen to what I’ve written.<a href="#fn0719" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Monetary reasons: as demonstrated by my lack of monetization of the book I’m writing, despite explicit requests to set up a way for people to pay me, this is not a motivation for me. Honestly, I am lucky enough that I can afford to treat art as a thing I do entirely separate from the monetary compensation it could produce. I don’t think artists necessarily make better work when they don’t have a financial incentive, but I think that I, at least, do.</p></li>
<li><p>I don’t really think that the world needs to hear my musical voice. I’m getting a Ph. D. in part because I do think that I have something to add to the world. I’m writing a book, in some small part, at least, for the same reason. I don’t really feel like this idea resonates with me at all, which is interesting. The monetary one at least struck me as wrong. This just strikes me as irrelevant</p></li>
<li><p>Demonstration of proficiency: I can see how this seems similar to the first reason, but I can see a difference.<a href="#fn0720" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> I think that there’s something to this. I do love type two fun in retrospect.<a href="#fn0721" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> That’s at least one reason to record an album, I suppose. It would be cool to be able to point to it as something that I’ve written and composed, if only because it’s a cool flex.</p></li>
<li><p>Fun/other positive terms: yeah ok, as discussed above, this is a motivation. I think that I would learn a lot about myself from writing an album. I think that I would learn a lot more in recording one. I think that I would learn a ton more in mastering and mixing and releasing. I think that I’ve gotten a thick enough skin from my web serial to be comfortable putting out my music for the wider world.</p></li>
<li><p>Accountability: I think there’s also something about this to me. When the band I play in<a href="#fn0722" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> was more active, that was a reason to compose. Now that I don’t even go to open mics<a href="#fn0723" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>, I don’t have much reason to do music. Having an explicit goal would, hopefully, at least, keep me accountable.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, so I for sure still want to write an album. This past month<a href="#fn0724" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> has been really focused on my ability to output large quantities of prose. I think that it is an important skill to develop, but I think that producing better prose is also important. In an ideal world, I think that I, at least<a href="#fn0725" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> would benefit from alternating between phases where work on getting more words out faster and getting the words which come out to be better faster. The better my first drafts are, the less that I will need to revise them, which means the less time that I end up needing to spend on a project, which means that I can get through more of the infinite projects I want to write.</p>
<p>For all that I’ve already decided that next month I’ll really explore the craft of prose more, I think that it could also be healthy and fun to get back into the practice of poetry. I don’t think that jumping right back into composing songs would be my best bet, because that’s such a jump to go from nothing to full songs. Instead, I think that a month of intentional poetry practice could be really helpful and healthy. I probably want to do some sort of metered form, but I have a few days to decide what, exactly, I want that form to look like.<a href="#fn0726" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> So that’s December sorted.</p>
<p>I have vague memories of the goals I set for myself at the start of the year.<a href="#fn0727" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> Hmm, it appears as though they were more implicit than explicit. Oh well!</p>
<p>I remember that one goal was to do species counterpoint every day. I still would like to do that. Given that I’ve been able to find the time to write at least 1800 words<a href="#fn0728" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> a day every day today, I can certainly make the time to do a quick little counterpoint exercise. If I keep up the poetry into January, it’s not inconceivable that the process of daily composing music and writing poetry will cause me to explicitly create song. If not, however, I always have the option of making that a goal for February.</p>
<p>From there, I would have like 6 months to record the album, which means really that I need to dedicate a week or two to doing nothing but it.<a href="#fn0729" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> That really does feel somewhat realistic. What else did I plan to do this past year? Even though it’s not the end of the year, I still have time to make the resolutions work.</p>
<p>I have yet to take an improv class. I have one more chance to make it happen.<a href="#fn0730" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>Huh, otherwise, I think I’ve generally done ok with keeping up on the goals. Next year I do want to be better at getting the sleep I need. Very rarely are activities worth losing a night of sleep over, and I more and more realize that every day.</p>
<p>Well, while this post went on a long and rambly course, I guess I did reaffirm the fact that I want to make an album. I just need to write songs, compose music, and record and master it. I don’t need it to be perfect, just serviceable.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write 1700 words for NaNoWriMo? I did! Yesterday too. I’m so close to the finish line, which is cool. I still don’t really like the book, which is ok. I will finish it, and then I never have to look at it again.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb? I finished plotting out the rest of the arc, and I sent the arc to the beta reader. Beta approved it, so now I just need to write it.<a href="#fn0731" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> Edit: I realized that, due to the frankly nonsensical way that I structured my daily word goals, every extra word I write today drops my goals for tomorrow by at least a word. That’s probably worth doing, if only because I’m tired of playing catch-up, and setting lower goals is one way to do that.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? I have! Look at this monstrosity. Gaze upon the madness.<a href="#fn0732" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? I went lifting far too early today. It was fun, and it absolutely set me up for success today. However, I know without a doubt that I will regret not stretching if I do not. I’ll do it after this post.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing better at prayer than a rushed and thoughtless rosary? I made it through a decade yesterday. I have higher hopes for today.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing a good job writing letters to friends? No! I wrote the number of letters that I had hoped to this month, though, which is nice to realize.</p></li>

<li id="fn072" role="doc-endnote"><p>I used to be a pedant about how song only referred to sung music. I don’t know if I still am, but a part of me still thinks that it’s, at the very least, a reasonable way to distinguish kinds of music. Given that the piece I wrote was a chamber ensemble for two clarinets, an oboe, and a piano, it was very song like in its nature. Of course, as a person who now claims that his main area of study was historical music, all music has an element of being sung by its nature. The way that we think about music changing over time is a fascinating topic, and one that I would study if I had infinite time. (more and more I’m realizing that I don’t have enough time to learn everything I want to learn, and will have to pick and choose what I am interested in)<a href="#fn07ref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn078" role="doc-endnote"><p>hard for me to classify the feeling without investigating more.

<li id="fn079" role="doc-endnote"><p>which remains absolutely insane to me. Then again, I feel like the way that I interact with digital media is fundamentally different than a lot of my peers.

<li id="fn0710" role="doc-endnote"><p>a dear friend who is pursuing a Ph. D. in Mathematics introduced me to the idea of necessary and sufficient conditions.

<h1 id="reflections-on-todays-gospel"><a href="reflections-on-readings-christ-king-a-23.html">Reflections on Today’s Gospel</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 November 26</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Wow! The end of another liturgical year. Despite the fact that the Church more or less created the calendar we use<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and absolutely created the liturgical calendar we use, the two do not line up. There is probably some legitimate reason for that. Off the top of my head, the fact that Christmas is not on January 1st, despite arguably being the most important winter day in the Modern Church<a href="#fn082" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, is already enough of a reason to know that the two would diverge. It does go further, though. The modern liturgical calendar begins with Advent, which begins on the first Sunday of November.<a href="#fn083" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>I can probably think of some benefits of doing it this way. One obvious one is that it gives us, at minimum, two days a year that we can call the first of the year. For all that each day is special and perfect in its own way, there’s something intrinsically human about the desire to treat continuity as discrete. Hearing that it’s the end of the year spurs us to consider the next year and to think about how we might change for the better.<a href="#fn084" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Regardless of how important the fact that each year has ended in a new beginning, and will continue to do so until time itself ends, the fact that a year ends is equally important. It reminds us of other endings, most pressing of which is the ending of our life.</p>
<p>The Feast of Christ the King is the last Sunday of the Liturgical Year. Obviously,<a href="#fn085" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> it concerns the end of time and the end of our own lives. It contains some readings that I’ve always struggled with, though differently as I’ve grown older.<a href="#fn086" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>The first reading comes from Ezekiel. In it, we are told that we will be separated into rams and goats. Of course, I know that this does not mean that we are predestined, as is a common enough heresy in the modern age. The fact remains, though, that we will be judged. We are reminded constantly that only in accepting our own limitations and weaknesses can we truly be strong. The reading emphasizes this, saying: “The lost I will seek out, the strayed I will bring back, the injured I will bind up, the sick I will heal, but the sleek and the strong I will destroy, shepherding them rightly.”<a href="#fn087" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The second reading comes, as they tend to, from Paul. Here we are reminded that all will be raised on the last day, beginning with Christ. For all that it’s very easy and settled theology now, I’m more and more appreciating the fact that he makes incredibly bold and outlandish claims by the standards of how the world is otherwise known to work.</p>
<p>Finally, we get to the Gospel. This Gospel passage is quite possibly the easiest passage to understand what we are called to do, for all that it is also one of the hardest to accomplish. In no uncertain terms, we are told that every time we see someone hungry, thirsty, a stranger, ill, or naked<a href="#fn088" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> we see Christ. We can either choose to ignore Him, or we can choose to help Him.</p>
<p>Of course, there is clearly more to the Gospel today than just that message. If there wasn’t, then there would be no way that the Church could justify letting the hungry starve, the prisoner live neglected, the ill die on the streets, or immigrants be torn from their families. Where we are able to draw the distinction, I do not know.</p>
<p>However, as I write today’s musing, I am in my heated home, wearing warm clothes and a soft blanket. I know that there are far too many people right now who are not inside, instead huddling for warmth in the bitter winter air. Knowing that each of them is as Christ to me makes me feel like I need to do more. When I look at what’s happening in the world right now, it seems as though no one has heard this Gospel.</p>
<p>A common objection to giving money to the poor is that they might waste it on something frivolous. As a person who believes very strongly in medicine, the idea that someone with a mental illness might self medicate with alcohol doesn’t really bother me. After all, I have plenty of friends who use different substances to self medicate, and I don’t judge them for it. Why would I judge someone living an objectively harder life?</p>
<p>I’m late enough in writing this musing that I don’t really have the energy to see what the great thinkers of the Church have said about this passage, but I would be curious. Maybe I’ll look another day.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write 1700 words for NaNoWriMo? It’s far too late for me to start, but start I must. Yesterday I was in a similar boat, which is why the musing didn’t come out.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb? I said I wasn’t going to work on it on Sundays, and so I shan’t.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? I think this counts, for all that I chose actively not to yesterday.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? Nope! I’m going lifting early tomorrow morning, though, so maybe that will count.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing better at prayer than a rushed and thoughtless rosary? I’ll try to do a rosary tonight, but very well may fall asleep during it.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing a good job writing letters to friends? I met with friends yesterday and called a friend for like 2 hours today. Even though it’s not a letter, it serves much of the same purpose, which is staying in touch with the people I care about and love. I also got to see some other friends during catechesis tonight, which is always nice.</p></li>
</ul>

<li id="fn081" role="doc-endnote"><p>it isn’t the Gregorian Calendar for no reason. One of the Popes Gregory (should it be Pope Gregories? I never quite know what to do with anglicized titles) created it, or at least mandated its usage. It happened after 1050, which we know because the Orthodox Church doesn’t recognize it (honestly, the fact that I can use random facts to start dating things relative to each other is kind of fun)<a href="#fn08ref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn082" role="doc-endnote"><p>ok, so pre Vatican 2, the Solemnity of Mary, Mother of G-d (January 1st) was celebrated as the Feast of the Circumcision (which I have always loved as a title, for all that it icks a lot of modern listeners out (for good reason)), and that was (as best as I understand Second Temple practice) the day that Christ would have been officially named and brought into the Church. It isn’t seen that way anymore, and that is probably not a fight the Vatican wanted to start<a href="#fn08ref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn083" role="doc-endnote"><p>I’m sure there’s edge cases, because there always are with simple rules. However, the edge cases were already dealt with, because we can, with total certainty, predict what day will occur when arbitrarily far into the future. There’s probably something to add about a post I saw recently talking about how modern society, having now given up belief in the Almighty, is almost required to fall into nihilism. Having just now watched a video from a science channel I really like exactly on how the universe will be mostly dead in a fraction of a fraction of the time that it will take to totally die, I can’t say that I have any real argument against that logic. I want to think about it later, but I’m not sure that now is the perfect time.<a href="#fn08ref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn084" role="doc-endnote"><p>Or at least it does for me. The fact that New Year’s Resolutions are a whole thing implies that it’s at least a strong cultural cue, even if it’s not innate<a href="#fn08ref4" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn085" role="doc-endnote"><p>well, obviously given the segue I used to get us here<a href="#fn08ref5" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn086" role="doc-endnote"><p>the fact that I feel like most weeks I start the reflection with a comment similar to this about struggling probably implies something. Whether it’s dissatisfaction with the way the world is, lack of depth of understanding, or disagreement with the Church, I haven’t quite figured out. As it is, I think it’s good for me not to be complacent or comfortable. Growth only happens when you’re neither<a href="#fn08ref6" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<h1 id="flash-fiction-friday"><a href="flash-fiction-228.html">Flash Fiction Friday</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 November 24</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Prereading note: this is being written as a way to generate my fiction for the week. As a result, the first draft (potentially the only draft I post) will be very rambly and disjointed. I will pick up and discard ideas like small pebbles or shells on a wave-swept beach, sifting to find the one that speaks to me.</p>
<p>This is my third week in a row musing about what I want to write for Flash Fiction Friday.<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> This week’s theme is “A form of distraction.”</p>
<p>Alright, let’s start iterating.</p>
<p>Form of distraction could mean kind of distraction. Form can also be like the shape of an object, such as form over function. What shape does distraction take?</p>
<p>Ok that’s maybe too far into the weeds, but we’ll put a pin in that and maybe come back.</p>
<p>What do I want to do with a form of distraction?</p>
<p>The obvious meaning<a href="#fn092" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> is something we do to redirect our attention away from something we don’t want to deal with. Form here modifies distraction in the sense of a shape that distraction can be forced into.</p>
<p>If we instead make distraction the agent, and we the object<a href="#fn093" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, we end up with a form of distraction being a way that distraction takes over us.</p>
<p>I haven’t been writing as much these past few days as I would normally like, so I suppose that it’s only natural that my mind goes to writing as the actual center of this story. A form of distraction here could refer to the ways that my attention are pulled from the writing and craft I’ve been dedicated to. Ok I also want to try using the writing advice that I read about recently. Since I don’t want to have to keep going to the <a href="writing-7.html">musing about it</a> and searching through the rambled prose, the rules are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>No think verbs</p></li>
<li><p>No remembering, only flashbacks</p></li>
<li><p>Characters do not belong alone.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If I stick to those three rules, there’s also an implication that I’m in either first person or third person omniscient, since third limited, in my experience, at least, explicitly calls out the thoughts that a character has. Maybe that’s just because the writing I read is bad according to this method, but I don’t think so.<a href="#fn094" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Ok so I think that I want to have something about the form of distraction in writing. I need to have characters, plural, but I don’t know if I really want that. The two desires are clashing. I’m going to take a minute<a href="#fn095" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> and try to form the fiction, seeing what I produce.</p>
<p>Quick note: even before starting to write, i realize that I don’t really want dialogue in this fiction. I write a lot of fiction in everything else that I do, and I think that this site being a place where I minimize dialogue in fiction might be a good idea for me. Maybe not. Ultimately, though, I’m writing this for fun, and it’s completely uncoupled from all the other writing I do, even more than the rest of it is fairly atomized. I’m going to write the first draft as free association and see what comes out.</p>
<p>Two lines in, I’m realizing that I want this to be poetry? I think that there could be something fun with a mixture between poetry and prose. Maybe the first half is poetry<a href="#fn096" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> and then it shifts to prose, reflecting a distraction at a meta level. Is that too edgy for the sake of being different? Maybe! Bu we’ll get to find out, and that’s really the nature of doing short writing. At worst, it doesn’t work and I spent a few minutes doing some writing that didn’t end up working how I thought it might.</p>
<p>Ok, so I don’t really hate what I’ve written. I think that it’s a really strong start, for all that I ended where I think that I want the actual story to start. I guess the question is how blatant I want to be. The writer I cite for writing advice says that starting with the declarative kills the suspense of the other writing. I think that I’ll try leaving the reveal to the end, for all that I know that I’ll need to put the reveal somewhere that makes it better. What I’ve drafted so far, though, is probably good enough for me to start working on the other two and a half writing assignments I have for the day.<a href="#fn097" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Having now finished one of the writing assignments,<a href="#fn098" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> it is now time, I suppose to try revising the FFF. Honestly, though, given that I’m spending time with my family, I don’t know what my motivation level really is. We’re all doing something else while watching a movie,. Then again, I should keep writing, if only because I want to increase my word count for the day. Maybe I’ll try my second assignment for the day.<a href="#fn099" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Well, I think that I honestly am pretty happy with the way this latest draft came out. I’m not sure if I quite want to post it, if only because I feel like there’s merit in writing things solely for my own sake. Now, I suppose, the question is whether I want to rewrite this draft or start writing the final thing I have to write today.</p>
<p>Let’s make a quick pro contra for each. Pros of redrafting this: it’s easy, and I think that it could be fun to reflect about what I wrote in a slightly more coherent manner. Cons of redrafting this: redrafting is really just code for rewriting wholesale, and I don’t know if I really want to do that. Pros of writing Jeb: I get further ahead of the writing that I give to my readers, and I have less stress about doing it in the future. Cons of writing Jeb: I have to figure out where I want the plot<a href="#fn0910" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> to go.</p>
<p>I think that it might be worth, if nothing else, trying to figure out where I want to take the book in the next few chapters. For all that it feels like I kind of have too many words to fill, the number of chapters I have left to tell my story is rapidly shrinking.</p>
<p>Honestly, drafting the book did a lot to help me start to feel ready for writing. I only got halfway through plotting the rest of this book, but I realized that there’s actually a very limited number of things that I need<a href="#fn0911" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> to have happen in the rest of this arc, but I started working backwards. Unfortunately, that means that I still have the rest of the intermediate content to do, including the chapters I need to write right now.<a href="#fn0912" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Anyways, good job with writing today me.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write 1700 words for NaNoWriMo? I did write the content. It’s weird for me to realize that I really only have six days to finish the book. I’m beginning to understand why so many authors put all the action in the last five to ten percent of the novel.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb? I did not, but I did start to plot it out, which is probably better for me in the mid to long term. A family member just caught up on it, though, which is pretty exciting!</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? Wow look at this completely incomprehensible post. It’s still a post though.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? I have been so lazy today. In fairness, I think that the day after a major holiday is almost always a lazy day for my family. It’s nice that we go from active rest, where we do things to make us all feel special, to passive rest, where we just spend time with each other.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing better at prayer than a rushed and thoughtless rosary? Despite the rosy description above, no.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing a good job writing letters to friends? I am not. I’m meeting with friends tomorrow, though, which is a similar vibe.</p></li>
</ul>

<li id="fn094" role="doc-endnote"><p>I mean, a lot of the writing I read is unquestionably unskilled, at the very least. However, it seems as though the writing I read that is better, at least nominally, still uses think. I guess it’s like the analogy of vibrato and ketchup (early musicians tend to say that vibrato is like ketchup. It’s fine and good, but if you put it on everything, everything will taste like ketchup).<a href="#fn09ref4" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn097" role="doc-endnote"><p>NaNo, Jeb, and that’s about it. I guess this counts as the third, but I’ve (clearly) already started on it. I guess the question is if I should go straight through NaNo like I’ve done basically every day this month, or if I should take some breaks in the middle. Last night, despite the fact that I said I was not going to finish, I somehow did, which was really great and cool.<a href="#fn09ref7" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn0912" role="doc-endnote"><p>I know that some authors do not write strictly chronologically, which doesn’t really make sense to me. I don’t really know how to think about the end of the book without thinking about each step before it. Learning to write better prose might help with that.<a href="#fn09ref12" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
