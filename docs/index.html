<p>First Published: 2025 May 29</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-29-may-2025">Draft 1: 29 May 2025</h1>
<p>Last week I had the really nice opportunity to take part in a university-sponsored dissertation writing camp. Earlier iterations of this site spent much more time reflecting on the things I experienced, rather than just thinking about things, and so it feels reasonable to do so now. It ran from Monday to Friday, 9am to 430ish pm except for Friday which ended around 1300.</p>
<p>Each morning started with a fifteen to twenty minute presentation about some important part of the dissertation process, reminders for the camp in general, goal setting time. Because I respect the idea that copying wholesale is never appreciation, I’m not going to list every activity we did or every presentation’s content.<a href="#fn001" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Goal setting was, despite how ridiculous it felt to me every day, really helpful, if only because it let me set my mind at ease knowing that I had things to do. It also helped me realize that what I set as a minimum goal is really almost always about what the actual amount of work I’ll do in a day. I’m sure that there is a lot I could say about how<a href="#fn002" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> I consider my level of work always the minimum. I did slowly lower my expectations over the week, which was also probably good.</p>
<p>Something I found really interesting was just how much I not only knew a lot of the writing advice, but how much I had internalized it. I no longer write a first draft with any expectation of it having anything but potentially the content that I want in the final version.<a href="#fn003" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref3"><sup>3</sup></a> I know that habit is important in writing, and I know that like passive voice generally bad, unless trying to distance self from the project.</p>
<p>I also found it really interesting how different my reality is from those around me. I mentioned that my goal each day was usually in the 2000 to 4000 range and got a lot of shocked looks. When I said that I absolutely hit that goal every day, they definitely did not look at me like I was fully human. For some, this made sense. Especially if I was working on a later draft of one of the chapters, there’s no way that I could get that many words out. As someone who was literally just vomiting words on the paper because I can’t edit an empty page, though, it felt strange to know that they were writing so little.<a href="#fn004" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref4"><sup>4</sup></a> I do know a number of people were reading literature or otherwise gathering knowledge, and I’m sure that some are of the team that like it’s important to get the final words on at a time, which is a totally valid take.<a href="#fn005" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>It was really interesting to see that so much of what I find hard about the thesis<a href="#fn006" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref6"><sup>6</sup></a> process is shared not just between fields, but between like the entire graduate school. I’m very glad not to be a literary studies candidate, because I absolutely could not write hundreds of pages of text without many pictures, and the fact that they do is so impressive. In general, though, every time that I wanted to start playing a game instead of working, the fact that I would look around and see my explicit peers working hard meant that I did not. I did get up for a lot of walks, but like that’s so fine.</p>
<p>The lunchtime seminars were also cool. On Monday we kind of just went over the most normative writing advice<a href="#fn007" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref7"><sup>7</sup></a>. Tuesday was something similar. Wednesday was an absolutely incredible seminar about mental health.<a href="#fn008" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Thursday we learned about the absolute requirements from the graduate school about our thesis<a href="#fn009" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref9"><sup>9</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The closing sessions were often something similar, though tended to also have some element of interactivity. I liked them, in general. It was nice chatting with people and reflecting on the goals I had.</p>
<p>On Wednesday of camp, we were all hitting the midweek slump. I suggested a rousing “one, two, three, team!” to wake us up, and people semi-begrudgingly participated. As we closed for the night someone shyly raised their hand and asked if we could do it again. I felt so seen then.</p>
<p>Really, that reflected the broader takeaway I had from the camp experience: I wanted more camp. I, for one, think that an overnight writing lock-in would be really productive for me. More than that<a href="#fn0010" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref10"><sup>10</sup></a>, though, one of the explicit goals of the camp was that we bond with one another. Camp-like activities<a href="#fn0011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref11"><sup>11</sup></a> are a great way for people to bond. People seemed generally receptive to the idea, but no one really seemed to want to put in into practice.</p>
<p>The camp coordinators were also fantastic. All three are members of the writing center during the regular day, and they set up fifteen minute slots for us to talk about whatever was going on with our thesis. I’m not sure if I used those correctly, because in general I kind of just went and said “I think this” and got told “yeah, sure”. That reflects far more on me, though, because I did not have a clear goal for what I wanted in the conversations, and I do know the low hanging fruit that applies to all people.</p>
<p>All in all, I really loved the week, would absolutely do another one if ever given the chance, and recommend anyone else to do one as well.<a href="#fn0012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h1 id="daily-reflection-29-may-2025">Daily Reflection 29 May 2025</h1>
<ol>
<li><p>Top Priorities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sleep:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Keeping sleep time sacred?</p>
<p>Yeah! I’m trying a new sleep schedule, and today at least it felt really good! I’m not sure if it’s just the thrill of trying something new, but despite the folly yesterday, I am absolutely currently setting my sleep schedule based on the idea of waking and sleeping on set time tables. There’s a question I have about whether the real best sleep schedule might just be sleeping until well rested twice a day, but the big issue with that is that I do absolutely oversleep when given the chance.</p></li>
<li><p>Good sleep hygiene?</p>
<p>Decent! I moved my bed, like I have been thinking about doing for almost five years now<a href="#fn0013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref13"><sup>13</sup></a>. I tried to not spend time in bed when I wasn’t doing sleep tasks, and wow do I need a beanbag chair I think.<a href="#fn0014" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Maybe I just need another mattress? Something to lie on on the ground that’s also comfortable but not meant for sleep. I’m sure that there exist answers, but.</p></li>
<li><p>Sleeping enough?</p>
<p>I think so! New sleep schedule doing great things for me today. Part of the new schedule was not going to bed before a certain time, and it’s really weird to me just how much time there is in a day. I ended up needing to make a list of just like “here are things that take time that you generally want to do. What if you tried that?” because I saw that I had an extra three hours. It was really cool to be able to just dedicate 45 minutes to reading a book, which is something I’m always wanting to do more and never actually doing! I also got a nice workout in, which was really cool and fun.</p></li>
<li><p>How well rested do I feel?</p>
<p>Honestly really good. Much as I loathe the linear clock, I do have to admit that saying “this is get up time and so I must arise” is much more effective in me than most of the other systems I’ve tried, at least for today.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Feed myself:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I eat breakfast?</p>
<p>Yesterday I did! Today I had an apple.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I eat a second meal?</p>
<p>Yesterday I had two second meals! I ate something at 11ish and at 1400/1600<a href="#fn0015" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref15"><sup>15</sup></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I eat dinner?</p>
<p>I had two dinners! Because first dinner was right after finishing the snack<a href="#fn0016" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref16"><sup>16</sup></a>, I think that I ended up being hungry again before it was time for bed. Staying up an extra few hours probably contributed to that as well, and so I had second dinner too! It’s wild how good I feel when I eat real food, is really what I think that I’m getting at.</p></li>
<li><p>Water?</p>
<p>Generally! I found myself wanting to drink water again, which was really cool.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Family:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Am I neglecting any familial obligations?</p>
<p>Not really. I could listen to the album more, but that’s usually true. Might try to do that in the gym today, or else during a walk.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Movement:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Am I stretching at least 5 minutes per hour of computer time?</p>
<p>I did not so much explicitly yesterday, and I did muse about that in the folly. In general, I think that it is probably better for me, even if worse for my immediate productivity, to do so, so I think we’re going to shoot for it again. I did, however, stretch a bunch yesterday, and so might average out to once per hour.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I generally making efforts to be limber?</p>
<p>Kind of! I forgot to stretch before leaving for work today, but I can do that at the first hour break.<a href="#fn0017" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Spirituality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Time for prayer?</p>
<p>This is absolutely something that I can add in since I absolutely have been wanting to find more things to do. Prayer is important, even if silence is actively aggressive to me these days.</p></li>
<li><p>Prayer?</p>
<p>See above.</p></li>
<li><p>Time for sacred silence?</p>
<p>See above. Then again, I have been spending the last little bit before bed in silence and the first little bit in the morning, just because I leave the electronics in another room before sleeping, and it does really feel nice.</p></li>
<li><p>Deep breaths?</p>
<p>More than before, at least.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Secondary Priorities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Thesis/ Ph.D. work:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Keeping up on the writing deadlines?</p>
<p>Eh. Yesterday I wrote a draft of the my conference presentation and finished rewriting some pieces of the code that had broken from a good idea I had. I’m trying to resubmit some jobs, but I apparently had a bunch of jobs half-fail at the start of the month and just completely forgot to check up on them, which I feel bad about.<a href="#fn0018" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Today’s goals are revising the paper and making the plots for it, with some more thesis work later down.</p></li>
<li><p>Reading the necessary things?</p>
<p>Nothing is necessary, to this day.</p></li>
<li><p>Making graphs?</p>
<p>Nope, but we’re going to do that now. Wild that I didn’t ever pay attention to the majority of the jobs breaking down.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Visual depiction of Latin Hypercube</p></li>
<li><p>Visual depiction of Loomis-Wood Diagrams</p></li>
<li><p>Visual depiction of Spectral Stacking</p></li>
<li><p>Visual depiction of how the fitness of the spectral stacks is really reliant on the graphs being the right height</p></li>
<li><p>Plots from the actual results of the runs, to make sure that it worked out.<a href="#fn0019" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref19"><sup>19</sup></a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Visual depiction of Grid Search</p></li>
<li><p>Visual depiction of random search</p></li>
<li><p>I guess that the stuff for intro to quantum video counts here.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Organizing citations?</p>
<p>I don’t think that I need to do this.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Love:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Taking risks?</p>
<p>Not a ton, but some very marginal ones.</p></li>
<li><p>Making efforts?</p>
<p>Kind of! At the absolute minimum I’m reading the book on relationships.</p></li>
<li><p>Showing affection?</p>
<p>Decently! I don’t know if I was really interacting with others in person, so maybe it’s important to do more digital shows of affection.</p></li>
<li><p>Being honest?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so. At the very least not being dishonest!</p></li>
<li><p>Being open?</p>
<p>Generally! Luckily even if I’m an open book, that does not immediately mean people are going to read.</p></li>
<li><p>Being appropriately vulnerable?</p>
<p>Sure!</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Adjacent to Primary and Secondary:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Typing Practice?</p>
<p>Forgot yesterday, and today I’m planning to use it as a semi break if I don’t feel like working through the list.</p></li>
<li><p>Applying to jobs?</p>
<p>Forgot to apply yesterday, have it on the list for today.</p></li>
<li><p>Reading the things I think could be good?</p>
<p>Eh, I gave up on one book because I realized that I didn’t care about the remainder of its content, and wow that was such a freeing realization.<a href="#fn0020" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Making manim videos?</p>
<p>No, but also on the list<a href="#fn0021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Cleaning?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Office</p>
<p>Nope</p></li>
<li><p>Home</p>
<p>A lot actually. I don’t think that it’s made a huge difference yet, but I think that it will soon show fruit.<a href="#fn0022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Car</p>
<p>No but doing that today</p></li>
<li><p>Computer</p>
<p>No</p></li>
<li><p>Other as needed</p>
<p>Generally tried to clean my mind yesterday. If the folly wasn’t enough of a sign, I realized that I really need to be journaling more.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>External Obligations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Guitar for wedding?</p>
<p>Not a ton.</p></li>
<li><p>Travel plans?</p>
<p>I realized that I haven’t made them! That doesn’t mean that I’m making them, though.</p></li>
<li><p>Talks for parks?</p>
<p>Honestly, I’m happy with the talk I have, so I’m just going to take this off the daily reflection</p></li>
<li><p>Other requested talks?</p>
<p>Nope! But I also don’t think that it’s the largest priority right now.</p></li>
<li><p>Talks for conferences?</p>
<p>Made a draft yesterday, and it’s rough, but I think that it will rapidly take shape as I add back in more things.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Tertiary Goals:<a href="#fn0023" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Blogging?</p>
<p>Yesterday.</p>
<p> And!</p>
<p> Today.</p></li>
<li><p>Reading?</p>
<p>I read for like 45 minutes yesterday and I spent another lot of time listening to audiobook, which felt nice.</p></li>
<li><p>Web Noveling?</p>
<p>Nope, which I just realized somehow didn’t make it form unordered to ordered list of tasks. It’s on there now.</p></li>
<li><p>Guitar?</p>
<p>Not a ton.</p></li>
<li><p>Other hobbies?</p>
<p>I realize that journal is a bit of a hobby, and I remembered that I have a fun fitness-adjacent set of games, so spent some time with them yesterday.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Quaternary Goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Letter writing</p>
<p>It’s on the list, even if it’s at the bottom of the list. Hmm should I make a full list of things again somewhere accessible so that I can make ordered lists each day? Probably soon, even if not right now because that’s absolutely a form of productive procrastination.</p></li>
<li><p>Handwriting/penmanship</p>
<p>I filled like five pages yesterday with lines and circles, and I think that I’m getting slightly better at making them good. It’s definitely not a fast process, and I have to imagine I’m already well into diminishing returns.</p></li>
<li><p>Picking a new signature</p>
<p>Nope. Putting it on the list though.</p></li>
</ul></li>

<h1 id="on-self-help"><a href="self-help.html">On Self Help</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2025 May 28</p>
<h1 id="draft-6-28-may-2025">Draft 6: 28 May 2025</h1>
<p>Something I’ve noticed in my writing is that early drafts hardly matter at all. I don’t know if those I interact with are the same way, but I need to write at least a full draft before I even know what I want to say in a given piece. This is true especially in this folly; I still don’t entirely know what I want it to say, but I am going to declare here that this draft will entirely just be my relationship to the self-help genre.</p>
<p>Self improvement is a laudable ideal. No one is perfect, and we can always strive towards betterment. In a literate society, then, it is perhaps unsurprising that self-help is such a large and profitable area to write and publish. I have read more than my fair share of self help literature, even if many of the authors I read would actively object to the label.</p>
<p>This past year, and these months in particular, has really changed the way I interact with the world. Part of it is obvious; I lost the fundamental touchstone of my mother. I also think that age is part of it; I am older now, and so my thoughts are better. And, I’m coming to the end of my plans; I had never really thought about what I wanted to do with my life post-being a doctor.</p>
<p>Despite feeling like a swimmer adrift, I am not reaching out for the lifelines of self help literature. At this point, I do not know if any self-help book can address the problems I’m facing, and that really comes down to the fact that the issues I face right now are so intrinsically personal. I cannot imagine that there are enough twenty-six year old graduate students about to finish a degree who have just lost their mother, a first-generation student who encouraged them to study for passion. Among those, I don’t know how many love to write so much, and love to love and interact so much as well.</p>
<p>Self-help as a concept is laudable, even though it often obscures the structural issues at play. Of course, very few people can directly change the structure of society, and so learning to work within the given system is understandable. Self-help books seem to me to struggle from the same issue as every form of education that does not take place in The Academy: impersonalization. We have known for almost 50 years now that a median student with a tutor will start to outperform ninety seven percent of their peers. I’m sure there’s literature suggesting why, but fundamentally I think it is because a one-on-one interaction with a tutor makes it far harder to ignore what you don’t know.</p>
<p>In short, I am grateful for the self-help books I have read, because many come with advice that, even if not helpful to me, is life-changing to someone I love. At a certain point, however, they stop being useful for self-improvement, because they cannot define the goals of my life. General career advice is great, but I would hope that me entering the job market with a Ph.D. is a very different process than someone entering the job market as a fresh college graduate. At a certain point in reading, the most helpful books shift from practical to philosophical. I’ve passed that point, and that’s ok.</p>
<p>Nice! Good draft me.</p>
<h1 id="draft-5-28-may-2025">Draft 5: 28 May 2025</h1>
<p>Self-help and adjacent genres all suffer from the same fundamental issue as society at large; they treat each person as interchangeable pieces in a great machine. Books I’ve read about productivity always assume that certain events can be automated away: rather than cook a meal each day, meal prep for a week in advance. No attention is paid to the more structural questions: why are you living alone, is there no one else who you can divide the labor with and why not, does cooking not have intrinsic beauty to it, why do you feel as though you need to do more? Perhaps it is unsurprising, then, that a number of authors in the mindfulness and wellness spaces do not like being lumped in with self-help. After all, most of them focus on feeling enough.</p>
<p>And yet, even these books which can discuss social structures that limit the effectiveness of any given advice, like “you can’t self-care yourself out of oppression”, do not speak to everyone’s lived and living experience. No one is totally normative, and everyone interacts with the world differently. This is beautiful and true and good, but means that the more one sees the world differently, the more important it is that one ignore much self-help advice.</p>
<p>Awareness of the passage of time terrifies me at a fundamental level, and I do not hit my productive strides until I am able to fully dive into the water of a given problem or idea. The pomodoro method, which I have to assume can only work for those whose labor does not require holding large ideas while working, is therefore counter to what I do.</p>
<p>Obsession is my tendency: if I measure it, I will smother it in affection and attention. When coupled with the societal tendencies I’ve inherited towards certain forms of addiction and disorder, I should not track every calorie that I eat.</p>
<p>As someone who has read a lot of self help, I absolutely agree that it does a lot of good for a lot of people. As someone who is so different from so many others<a href="#fn011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, I absolutely need to stop trusting the advice of strangers over my own lived experience. When authors cite studies, and do so correctly, their claims tend to be much more logic based: “assuming X, literature suggests Y.” If the assumption is wrong, it’s easy to toss it aside.</p>
<p>I’m not saying throw the baby out with the bathwater. I think that even the cringiest and objectively awful self-help books I’ve read have something to teach me. I just also think that at a certain point, we need to acknowledge that the field is only helpful in so much as it helps.</p>
<p>Was this just another ramble? Let’s read it and find out. If not, calling it here. If so, only allowed to revise.</p>
<h1 id="draft-4-28-may-2025">Draft 4: 28 May 2025</h1>
<p>Metaphor is powerful, and the superstructures of society impose metaphors on us. In today’s day and age, almost everyone I know can tell you the time to the minute with almost no effort, and has the capability to show the time to any desired degree of precision. Some people function well as cogs: the rotation of the earth for a 24 hour day, regardless of season, can be broken into externalized blocks of time. This is not meant to denigrate the cog-people<a href="#fn012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. In the society we inhabit, being able to function according to an external clock makes you happier in a very real sense: life is happier when less frictive, and not rubbing against the constraints of our societal cages keeps the sores from forming.</p>
<p>If I could choose to be a coglet, I would.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my relationship to time is not so mechanized. Knowing I have an appointment at 11, my day is blocked for at least 40 minutes leading up to it. Because I know that I do not relate well to time, I budget an extra half hour for any drive over fifteen minutes. Look at that, even when writing, I cannot escape the capitalist metaphor for time: budgeting implies spending implies that saving can happen. I arrive places early, because I am terrified of being late.</p>
<p>But, the cogless<a href="#fn013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref3"><sup>3</sup></a> suffer in other ways as well. Nearly every self-betterment routine assumes that blocks of time exist as interchangeable units. If I have dance for an hour before lunch, I can move that to the hour just after lunch so that there’s the extra morning hour of work, or so the claim goes. And, when dealing with external factors, this may well be true: the class lasts as long as the class-runner makes it.</p>
<p>When working alone, though, this is far from true. More than just my productivity at different hours of the day or days of the year, my need to use time changes as well. If I hold each stretch for thirty seconds, I don’t stretch some muscles enough, but I stretch others more than enough; it all depends on what is tight on a given day at a given time.</p>
<p>If I construct a schedule for myself that implies tasks take fixed times, I am attempting to slot myself into being a cog. Advice for those who struggle with time blindness is often tasked around finding the level of scheduling where every minute that goes by was spent well.<a href="#fn014" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref4"><sup>4</sup></a> As someone who knows that some of my best memories come from the untracked hours I spent talking with friends, any linear awareness of time passing prevents me from fully experiencing the moment.</p>
<p>I don’t quite know how to make this work for me, though. If I don’t do things hourly, I will often not do them at all; I have been known to sit at a computer unmoving for hours on end. If I stop each hour to stretch, though, a part of me is looking at the clock, counting down how much more time I have until my next motion. The world around me conforms to linear time, and so if I want to interact with the world, I have to meet it on society’s terms. When scheduling for myself, though, I think that what is most important is that I set a minimum bar of effort: if after X words or pages or stretches or scales or etc. I still don’t feel like doing a task, then I can put it off for my next set.</p>
<p>It was suggested to me that I try a block scheduling for my life, affirming three periods of work with meals and movement after each. I think that this might work for me, especially if I am able to spend a few minutes each day determining what my priority list is. If I spend an entire day on one task, for instance, then I spent the entire day on it. If I cycle through every task and none feel good, then I know that I absolutely need to stop and interact with the world around me somehow, especially through movement. Will this new scheduling method work for me? Maybe.</p>
<p>Did this get completely off topic? Yeah... Final attempt?</p>
<h1 id="draft-3-28-may-2025">Draft 3: 28 May 2025</h1>
<p>Metaphor is powerful.</p>
<p>The 2008 financial crisis came because mortgages were compared to human lifetimes. When I say that there is a well I pull from to write, I tell myself that waiting to recover for days is the appropriate method to stall burnout.</p>
<p>Self-knowledge does not mean self-mastery.</p>
<p>I know that I struggle to start tasks; each new occasion marks another leap into an unknown and unlit chasm. I know that I struggle to finish tasks; a phantasm of death comes to collect each time I end something. Neither of these is a moral failing, or even really a failing at all. However, I need to schedule my life with the full knowledge that I will always have to force the first drops out.</p>
<p>If I had to distill the entirety of useful self-help literature I’ve read into just a few pieces, I think that these are the most resonant right now. However, in most of the other drafts, I’ve ignored another key question: what is the point of self-help literature? In short, I’d argue that self-help as a genre is about noticing areas of life dissatisfaction and removing that feeling. Depending on the book, that might present as learning to accept life as it is, or it might mean taking on new hobbies and routines.</p>
<p>Regardless of what advice one follows, though, there’s a point that I know to be important and true even though nothing inside of me resonates with the fact: there are twenty four hours per calendar day. We cannot save the time, and it will pass regardless of how it is used. It is not spending in any real sense, as spending implies the option to save.</p>
<p>Every last moment of every last day is used. If I am trying to add anything to the day, that means by definition something else needs to be removed. Sometimes that’s fairly easy: I don’t like eating lunch as a break meal, and so can afford to spend an extra few minutes reading during the night. Other times it’s incredibly difficult: I want to exercise more, but going to the gym alone is a ten to twenty minute round trip. Changing into clothes is another five or so<a href="#fn015" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref5"><sup>5</sup></a> in each direction, and showering is another impulse of time. At the very least then, if I want to work out in the gym, I need to budget, at the absolute minimum, thirty minutes more than the amount of time I want to work out.</p>
<p>So, how does this help me with self-help?</p>
<p>Realistically, it means that I more and more am in the camp of those who believe that the goal should be self-acceptance over self-improvement. I could log my time, it is true. However, logging my time is then a task of itself, and also like I refuse to see myself as solely a cog in a machine. Scheduling, even “practice for half an hour”, implicitly says that the linear relationship with time is the correct one and that there is some fundamental ordering to reality.</p>
<p>Oof this got away from me a little bit. Still, I’m curious where we’re going!</p>
<p>I’ve written before about scheduling my life. Try as I might, I have yet to find a method that works for more than a few days. There are, however, a number of things that I know absolutely do not work for me.</p>
<p>I should not go days on end without just sitting down and hand-writing whatever is on my mind. In no way must what I write be even slightly coherent, the importance is solely in physicalizing the thought. I cannot ever rely on motivation: even going to a friend’s party feels hard when in the midst of any other task. I should not have any games downloaded on my computer or phone: even when I promise myself it will just be a single game, ten minutes stretches into four hours far too easily. If there’s a barrier to a task, it will go undone: if my guitar is not reachable without moving from my bed, I play it far less than if I can literally pluck it without needing to sit up.<a href="#fn016" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>What else what else? I think that I might just try this again but in the form of rejecting time as authority.</p>
<h1 id="draft-2-28-may-2025">Draft 2: 28 May 2025</h1>
<p>Metaphors are powerful.</p>
<p>I often forget just how true this is for myself. I have spoken many times before about how my ideas and words come from a well of writing. Wells run dry, and the correct response to a well running dry is to let it refill. Therefore, when I feel as though writing is hard and the words are gone, I should stop and wait for new words to appear inside me.</p>
<p>This is perhaps true in some very very local sense for me, and only then. When I write more, I am more able to write even more. I refill myself by doing other forms of writing, not by avoiding writing altogether.</p>
<p>Metaphors are powerful, and the stories we tell are as well.</p>
<p>I believe that in general I am the biggest limiting factor to my success. In part, this is because I have managed to structure my life in such a way that it can tend to be true. I no longer do experimental work, and so if my calculations do not run or a paper is poorly written, it is on me. Buddhists talk about how the idea of self is an image, not reality. What does it mean for me to be my limiting factor? Looking non-religiously, what about the greater structures I find myself in? The world is more fragmented than it has ever been; labor has never been so divorced from results and compensation; workers are losing rights that were painfully clawed after for generations.</p>
<p>What stories do I tell that limit myself? One is always that I will ever want to do something. Even going to a friend’s home for Memorial Day, something that they actively expressed interest in me attending, is difficult.</p>
<p>If I want to accomplish something, I must either find a way to claim that it’s actually a continuation of some other task, or else grit my teeth, push through the thorns of complacency and fear, and find myself in a new grove of new tasks. If I want to finish something, I need to actively confront the spectre of death that lies in front of any accomplishment. Perhaps more importantly, though, I need to accept that neither of these are moral failings. Wanting to be better at starting and finishing tasks will not make it so, and even if there was some way for me to fix them, I do not know what it is. There’s something to be said for wishing the world was a better place, doing what I can to effect that change. However, there is also something fundamentally important about working in the current world.</p>
<p>Do I wish that the electoral system would represent the people and that I could vote for a candidate I passionately support? Yes. Do I know that I must vote for the candidate which I find least objectionable in almost every circumstance? Yes.</p>
<p>If I am comfortable with accepting that I don’t have a great political representative, why am I so opposed to accepting the parts of me that are not idealized?</p>
<p>At this point I must go to my meeting, but I do really feel like I’ve got a good post going, and I’m excited to finish it.<a href="#fn017" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h1 id="draft-1-28-may-2025">Draft 1: 28 May 2025</h1>
<p><a href="#fn018" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>What does it mean to be better?</p>
<p>This is a question I ask myself often. For many, it involves worldly success, which is often measured by money or influence. For others, it means that the boundaries they see in themselves are gradually eroded. For still others, it means learning to accept the boundaries which they have.</p>
<p>As someone who has consumed a large quantity of literature which could be described as self-help<a href="#fn019" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref9"><sup>9</sup></a>, the more that a book aims to effect specific changes in behaviors or patterns, the more that it tends to assume that the reader is “normal.” What any given author means by normal is very rarely explicitly stated, and it does differ slightly between different books, even those who share an author. In general, though, they assume someone who does not have a disability, has sufficient autonomy to markedly change their life if they so chose, and is dissatisfied with the state of their experience. Most tend towards a neo-liberal idea of self and betterment,<a href="#fn0110" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref10"><sup>10</sup></a> which assumes that we are cogs that should be constantly producing and that we can improve our lot in life solely by our own efforts.</p>
<p>It isn’t that I think they are intrinsically wrong. In fact, I do think that most people would benefit from knowing at least a little of the literature on how to live a life that is closer to what they want. At the very least, most of the books ask the reader to think about what they want, which I don’t think many of us do anywhere as often as we maybe should. It’s one thing to excel at the consequences of the choices we made, and it’s something far different to make sure that we’re choosing correctly.<a href="#fn0111" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref11"><sup>11</sup></a> However, the advice is, by nature of coming from a static book, one size for all. Every person is fundamentally and wholly unique<a href="#fn0112" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref12"><sup>12</sup></a>, and no advice will work for all people in all places.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most impactful piece of self-betterment advice I have encountered recently came during the dissertation writing camp I attended last week. During each lunch break, the organizers brought in a speaker to talk about some aspect of the writing experience. As someone who’s consumed perhaps too much literature on producing writing, most of the advice was completely old to me: write daily, accept that early drafts are bad, make sure that things are appropriately formatted when submitting, etc. On Wednesday, however, they brought in a speaker to talk about mental health in the dissertation writing process.</p>
<p>I do not have a good grasp on linear time, and I have significant mental inertia: once I start on something, even and especially a break, I find it hard to stop. Standard productivity advice, like the pomodoro method, is actively harmful not just to my productivity, but to my overall sense of well-being. Despite knowing this at intuitive and intellectual levels, I still generally feel as though the fact that I cannot get through the many tasks I wish I could is a personal and therefore moral failing.</p>
<p>At this seminar, there were three key things that felt as though they were shining light onto a part of me that I didn’t know existed, let alone was hidden in darkness. First, there is nothing wrong with not being able to follow any given writing advice; the speaker gave the example of someone with caretaking responsibilities being unable to consistently write at the same time every day, but quickly extended it. Second, the society we live in assumes that we can do literally everything on our own and that we should be able to do so. Even more than that, though, it tells us that we must judge our every action against not just our own goals, but also the accomplishments of those around us and those who could conceivably be called peers; once I finish my Ph.D., I am nominally on an even playing field with my advisor, so I should be able to output as much work in as short of a time frame. Of course, this idea is ridiculous; I hope the explanation alone conveys that. Finally, failing at something is not a moral failing.</p>
<p>I don’t know why that final statement struck me so hard. It’s not as though that’s something that I’ve ever been explicitly taught, and in fact my family raised me with the opposite belief. And yet, the effects of society worm their way deep into our psyches.</p>
<p>Each day of camp, we were asked to make three goals: a dream goal, a reasonable but optimistic goal, and a minimum goal. In doing these, I realized that I have a fundamentally different understanding of my capabilities as the rest of the camp, and likely the normative person too. The minimum goal for me is what I know that I can accomplish given the lowest productivity that I have had over the past three weeks. The reasonable but optimistic goal assumes that I do not spiral out during the process, and the dream goal assumes that I can work without rest and at a pace where my hands are the sole limiting factor in production.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of this, the first two days I was barely able to meet the minimum goal. There’s something to be said for setting lower goals, because that means that it’s easier to exceed expectations. At a deep and primal level, though, I hate that idea. Lowering standards never feels like a good thing to me.</p>
<p>How does this relate to the self-help literature?</p>
<p>In general, books aimed towards improving your life assume that you do not know what your capabilities are. People tend to overestimate some aspects of themselves and underestimate their skill in other domains. I do not claim to be any different in general, but I do think that I know what I can do and what I want to do.</p>
<p>The issue for me is always starting and finishing tasks. Something deep inside of me sees every new action as a cliff that will lead to sharp rocks. Finishing any project is ending, which is a form of death, and I have a reasonable fear of causing death in others.<a href="#fn0113" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Once in a space where I am working, I perform best when I am able to remove every obstacle: water should be close at hand or preferably even just lean-overable, because the way time does not pass for me means that I will otherwise forget it. Hunger, which often gnaws at me, silences itself when I find myself <a href="fugues-and-flow">working deeply</a>. Rewards do not work for me because I understand that I am not really reward motivated, I am external praise motivated.</p>
<p>Ok this is good, I think that the focus is really better expressed as what normative advice is and what I would advise me about. Mostly the latter, in fact.</p>
<h1 id="draft-0.5-28-may-2025">Draft 0.5: 28 May 2025</h1>
<p>As a musician, I was well-schooled in the idea that practicing scales and chords<a href="#fn0114" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref14"><sup>14</sup></a> actively improves my ability to write, play, perform, and generally experience music. As a writer, then, it feels like the same should be true for typing practice; the goal of scales is to allow the instrument to become part of you<a href="#fn0115" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref15"><sup>15</sup></a> by making the simple motions completely mindless. Typing practice lowers the barrier between thoughts existing in my mind and being put on the page. And yet, there’s nothing I’ve seen really anywhere to suggest that aspiring authors should do typing courses.</p>
<p>Part of it is obviously a historical precedence.<a href="#fn0116" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Typewriters and computer keyboards are far, far younger than notation modern enough to make practicing scales a concept. Given how many writers still do so by hand, it is perhaps unsurprising that the advice I was given is that the analog to scales for writing is free-writing, where there is no self editing. And yet, I find that I’m better able to write now as I have done more scales.</p>
<p>Hmmm this is also not getting me where i want to go. DO I want to write about self-help? I don’t know actually. Let’s try one more time, and we can see where we get it.</p>
<h1 id="draft-0-28-may-2025">Draft 0: 28 May 2025</h1>
<p>Something that I realize more and more as I grow older and<a href="#fn0117" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref17"><sup>17</sup></a> wiser is that I cannot live my life according to the standard set of optimization routines. This is not even in the “I am human not machine, and so cannot and should not be optimizing literally everything for the sake of optimization”, but also because I am not a standard human being. None of us are, which is another strike against the normative self-help literature<a href="#fn0118" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite, or perhaps because of this, I have consumed a large number of books whose nominal goal is life and self improvement. Some of these have been explicitly self-help, and others are more theoretical or philosophical. The fact that my family reading group<a href="#fn0119" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref19"><sup>19</sup></a> picked this genre often probably also says something about the environment I occupy. We have a family reading group, and of every book which has ever been, we tended to pick those which claimed that they could fix some broken part of us.</p>
<p>This could very easily spiral into a theological folly about how we cannot fix what is broken, but that being broken is fundamental to human nature. Or, I could reflect on the Buddhist books I’ve been reading lately<a href="#fn0120" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref20"><sup>20</sup></a>, and how viewing ourselves as broken is a bad story. For whatever reason, I’m instead reflecting on a book on rhetoric I read recently: “The Evolution of Mathematics”, along with the writing camp I attended last week.<a href="#fn0121" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The book argues that mathematics is best thought of as a type of rhetoric, and explores how Calculus required fundamentally shifting the rhetorical framework that people used when discussing numbers. It ended with a chapter discussing the paper which caused the 2008 global financial crisis through a rhetorical lens. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the derivations in the paper were mathematically valid, but made incorrect assumptions.</p>
<p>For some reason I’m thinking a lot about metaphor right now. There’s a metaphor I use often about how writing is a well. Sometimes the well runs dry, and that means that I need to stop writing for a time. As I experience right now, though, I think that’s fundamentally untrue.</p>
<p>So far as I can tell, the normal advice for self-care and self-growth involves trusting that you understand your bodies cues and listening to those cues. Recently, though, I gave someone advice which boiled down to “the only way to get through this is to just ignore the part of you that says you can’t do it.” That’s true for much, and I learned last week at writing camp that self-efficacy is better correlated with success than actual competency.</p>
<p>Ok wow this is spiraling fast. I don’t entirely know what I’m trying to say today, and that’s part of the issue. I haven’t been journaling by hand in a while, which is almost certainly part of it. Take two.</p>
<h1 id="daily-reflection-28-may-2025">Daily Reflection 28 May 2025</h1>

<li><p>Keeping sleep time sacred?</p>
<p>Yeah!</p></li>
<li><p>Good sleep hygiene?</p>
<p>Eh! Last night I took a nap from 7-9, was then unable to sleep for a hot second, but did some stretching which was probably the best thing for me at the situation.</p></li>
<li><p>Sleeping enough?</p>
<p>Probably! I woke up this morning a few minutes before my alarm, changed it, and then basked in the joy of warm blanket for a while</p></li>
<li><p>How well rested do I feel?</p>
<p>Generally fairly! I think that I might now be caught up on sleep, which is good!</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Feed myself:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I eat breakfast?</p>
<p>Today? I had a pack of gushers</p></li>
<li><p>Did I eat a second meal?</p>
<p>Am planning to get a bagel sandwich for lunch. Yesterday, as discussed below, I went through a large bowl of oats</p></li>
<li><p>Did I eat dinner?</p>
<p>I ate jerky last night, and tonight is Wednesday, so it is burger night.</p></li>
<li><p>Water?</p>
<p>Not as much as I would like, but we’re slowly edging back towards cells with water</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Family:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Am I neglecting any familial obligations?</p>
<p>Nope! Called the brothers and everything. We all have our tasks for the week, and mine is listening to the Red Album<a href="#fn0122" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Movement:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Am I stretching at least 5 minutes per hour of computer time?</p>
<p>I am a monster and ignored all the alarms last night.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I generally making efforts to be limber?</p>
<p>I stretched last night and then again this morning. I still feel tight, so I don’t know if it’s great.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Spirituality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Time for prayer?</p>
<p>No</p></li>
<li><p>Prayer?</p>
<p>A morning prayer!</p></li>
<li><p>Time for sacred silence?</p>
<p>Bedtime last night</p></li>
<li><p>Deep breaths?</p>
<p>I kept telling myself to, and um it’s hard to breathe deeply for some reason. Probably nothing worth thinking about</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Secondary Priorities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Thesis/ Ph.D. work:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Keeping up on the writing deadlines?</p>
<p>This week’s whole plan is making plots and whatnot for the paper and for anything that I want for the presentations I’m going to be giving. I’m terrified of submitting the jobs to the cluster, even though there is no reason for me to have that fear.</p></li>
<li><p>Reading the necessary things?</p>
<p>I think so! I did a good lit search this past weekend.</p></li>
<li><p>Making graphs?</p>
<p>I’m going to re-itemize this into things that I need for RF and things that I just generally need for the thesis or whatnot.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Visual depiction of Latin Hypercube</p></li>
<li><p>Visual depiction of Loomis-Wood Diagrams</p></li>
<li><p>Visual depiction of Spectral Stacking</p></li>
<li><p>Visual depiction of how the fitness of the spectral stacks is really reliant on the graphs being the right height</p></li>
<li><p>Plots from the actual results of the runs, to make sure that it worked out.<a href="#fn0123" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref23"><sup>23</sup></a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Visual depiction of Grid Search</p></li>
<li><p>Visual depiction of random search</p></li>
<li><p>I guess that the stuff for intro to quantum video counts here.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Oof that’s basically all things that I need to do this week. That’s fun and exciting, I guess.</p></li>
<li><p>Organizing citations?</p>
<p>Not so much, no. I did go through and clean some citation data yesterday, because I think that I don’t trust every computational result that comes out of scientists.<a href="#fn0124" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Love:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Taking risks?</p>
<p>Nope, let’s fix that now.</p></li>
<li><p>Making efforts?</p>
<p>Yeah! I reached out to a friend last night, and it was good to chat.</p></li>
<li><p>Showing affection?</p>
<p>I think so! It’s hard to show affection to everyone at all times, especially when I’m as tired as I’ve been lately, but that’s not really excuse.</p></li>
<li><p>Being honest?</p>
<p>I think so! Very few questions are being asked to me any more.</p></li>
<li><p>Being open?</p>
<p>Generally! I like showing the real me, and I think that I’m getting comfortable with my habit of loose papers in the backpack.<a href="#fn0125" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Being appropriately vulnerable?</p>
<p>Generally! I’m sharing the struggles I’m having with people. I’m shocked at how positive the response to my latest song is, because <strong>I</strong> thought that it was a cry for help, but.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Adjacent to Primary and Secondary:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Typing Practice?</p>
<p>I did yesterday, and will do once my writing buddy leaves for their day of work.</p></li>
<li><p>Applying to jobs?</p>
<p>I sent off two new job applications last night and will be starting another today.<a href="#fn0126" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Reading the things I think could be good?</p>
<p>Nope.</p></li>
<li><p>Making manim videos?</p>
<p>Nope, I really need to get on this though. I feel like I’m always running about 30 percent behind these days, and I have no clue why. Might be good to just plot out my life again.<a href="#fn0127" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>When do I have time for it, who can say?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Cleaning?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Office</p>
<p>Not really, but it would probably be good for me to spend a little more time this week doing that.</p></li>
<li><p>Home</p>
<p>Not a ton, and I really feel behind on it.</p></li>
<li><p>Car</p>
<p>I still need to return the telescope. It’s tempting to just do that today, but I’m also already in the office, and I like taking the bus sometimes.<a href="#fn0128" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Computer</p>
<p>Not really? I think that more and moreso<a href="#fn0129" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref29"><sup>29</sup></a> it’s getting to be clean. Then again, the number of files that I have on this writing site has once again ballooned, and I would like to start cleaning it out.</p></li>
<li><p>Other as needed</p>
<p>N/a.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>External Obligations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Guitar for wedding?</p>
<p>I think that I’m happy with how well I can noodle around on the chords, so assuming that the groom-to-be is cool with what I have<a href="#fn0130" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref30"><sup>30</sup></a>, it’s just going to be about practicing so that my fingers don’t bleed.</p></li>
<li><p>Travel plans?</p>
<p>No, but I really need to get on that.</p></li>
<li><p>Talks for parks?</p>
<p>I like the talk I have right now, and as I discussed with a friend yesterday, I can go on autopilot while delivering it, which is really nice. That being said, I think that there are other presentations I could do that might be better.</p></li>
<li><p>Other requested talks?</p>
<p>Not at all, but also need to get on that probably.</p></li>
<li><p>Talks for conferences?</p>
<p>No, but that’s the thing for the week.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Tertiary Goals:<a href="#fn0131" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Blogging?</p>
<p>Look at this!</p></li>
<li><p>Reading?</p>
<p>I restarted the “Full Murderhobo” series<a href="#fn0132" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref32"><sup>32</sup></a> on audiobook again. Is it at all high-brow? No. Is it enjoyable? Yeah!</p></li>
<li><p>Web Noveling?</p>
<p>Ughhhhhh this is another on the endless list of things that I fall short of. A dear friend just mentioned that they reread the entire series and are caught up, so there’s even more motivation to continue writing.</p></li>
<li><p>Guitar?</p>
<p>I have the song, I don’t know if I like the chords entirely as they are, and I know that I don’t like the way my voice sounded on the recording I did.</p></li>
<li><p>Other hobbies?</p>
<p>Not so much, no.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Quaternary Goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Letter writing</p>
<p>No, but that is a goal for today, I think. After my meeting, maybe I’ll go to my cage and write a letter. A small friend<a href="#fn0133" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref33"><sup>33</sup></a> of mine is about to have a birthday, and it would be nice to send a card, even if they cannot read it unaided.</p></li>
<li><p>Handwriting/penmanship</p>
<p>I did none yesterday, but I really want to be doing more. I saw a short tutorial on some mechanical drawing exercises, and I think that a lot of that will intersect nicely with the handwriting, because one goal is distinctive, but the other goal is reproducible.</p></li>
<li><p>Picking a new signature</p>
<p>No. I don’t know if this is actually something that I want to be doing, though.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="daily-reflection-27-may-2025">Daily Reflection 27 May 2025</h1>

<p>Generally!</p></li>
<li><p>Good sleep hygiene?</p>
<p>Maybe?</p></li>
<li><p>Sleeping enough?</p>
<p>Maybe? I do feel like I’m needing to sleep more but might just be running myself to the bone.</p></li>
<li><p>How well rested do I feel?</p>
<p>Eh.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Feed myself:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I eat breakfast?</p>
<p>In general I have not been doing well here. Today I’ve been working through a bowl of oats for like 4 hours.</p></li>
<li><p>Water?</p>
<p>Not well here either.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Family:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Am I neglecting any familial obligations?</p>

</ul></li>

<li><p>Am I stretching at least 5 minutes per hour of computer time?</p>
<p>No, shoot, time to add the alarms back to my schedule.</p></li>

<li><p>Plots from the actual results of the runs, to make sure that it worked out.<a href="#fn0134" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref34"><sup>34</sup></a>.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Organizing citations?</p>
<p>Yeah! Over the weekend I think that I went through all the papers that compare theory and experiment going back to the start of 2021. I’d like to get more, though.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Love:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Taking risks?</p>

<p>Maybe?</p></li>
<li><p>Being appropriately vulnerable?</p>

</ul></li>

<p>It’s starting to have entropy sickness again, but I have hope that I can fix it today.</p></li>
<li><p>Home</p>
<p>It’s better than it was but still horrifying. I really need to get rid of things I think.</p></li>
<li><p>Car</p>
<p>I made it clean so that I could put a telescope inside it. Now I need to return the telescope.</p></li>
<li><p>Computer</p>
<p>Generally! I think that I’m making progress on having an ordered one.</p></li>
<li><p>Other as needed</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>External Obligations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Guitar for wedding?</p>
<p>Yeah! I think that it’s coming nicely, and I was even recently inspired to write a whole new song with words and everything.</p></li>

<li><p>Talks for parks?</p>
<p>I just reused the talk from last year, and I think that it went well?</p></li>
<li><p>Other requested talks?</p>

<ul>

<li id="fn0118"><p>at this point I realized that the folly I had intended to write about paper and how I hold it was really better served as a thing about self help literature.

I didn’t think that they were right, but everyone else in my life agreed, and I have been realizing that, while it’s never my only method, it is one I always have. It’s nice being able to not have to damage or destroy books (codexes, I guess (codicies?)), and people in my life need a single piece of scratch paper fairly often (wow this is such a long footnote)<a href="#fn01ref25" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>

<h1 id="what-we-dont-post"><a href="what-we-dont-post.html">What We Don’t Post</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2025 May 23 (because forgot to hit post)</p>
<h1 id="draft-2-28-may-2025">Draft 2: 28 May 2025</h1>
<p>Of the many things that I do not post, things that I worry may negatively impact my future career aspirations are high on the list. As a child, I was always advised<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> to never willingly incriminate myself, and even though there is nothing objectively objectionable in what I deleted, I don’t know if it is necessarily a good look. There is a question to be had about whether it’s incriminating to describe that I have not posted something incriminating, but I think that I just don’t like being embarrassed by what I put out in the world.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-21-may-2025">Draft 1: 21 May 2025</h1>
<p>I have, not infrequently, written an entire blog post only to realize that it had no place on this site. That can happen for various reasons, and I’ve more recently started thinking about how I can still reference that I did do writing even if I’m not posting the results. So, with that in mind, let’s talk about what we don’t post.</p>
<p>Most often, what I don’t post is either overly political or overly personal. That which is overly personal often includes vulnerability that does not feel appropriate<a href="#fn022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, and more often than not these days focuses around my mother. From here on out, I’d like to make a new draft of this with each post that I don’t make.</p>
<p>Yesterday I got most of the way through a reflection about morality and the role of women in the Church, before realizing that I didn’t really care about it any more. More than that, though, I think that I forgot what I wanted to say in the post at all. I hadn’t, and haven’t, reflected about the meta-reasoning behind each folly, and don’t really know if this is the space I want to use for to do so.<a href="#fn023" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Anyways, all this to say, there is much that I do not post, even though this is something that I will</p>
<h1 id="daily-reflection-21-may-2025">Daily Reflection: 21 May 2025</h1>
<ol>
<li><p>Top Priorities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sleep:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Keeping sleep time sacred?</p>
<p>Yeah! Went to bed at like 8 again last night. Felt great, somehow actually slept through my alarm though!</p></li>
<li><p>Good sleep hygiene?</p>
<p>Eh, I have to imagine so.</p></li>
<li><p>Sleeping enough?</p>
<p>Slept through alarm which implies no, but idk, maybe it’s also just the whole “I’m getting up earlier than I am used to”.</p></li>
<li><p>How well rested do I feel?</p>
<p>Eh, decently. I get exhausted easily, but that’s the nature of life</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Feed myself:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I eat breakfast?</p>
<p>I’m about to! Yesterday I ate a breakfast equivalent.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I eat a second meal?</p>
<p>I did yesterday! I went for a long-ish walk and got the cheap overly large chinese-american lunch that is popular amongst a demographic of students here.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I eat dinner?</p>
<p>I think so! i honestly don’t remember what happened when I got home last night, I was just so tired.</p></li>
<li><p>Water?</p>
<p>Nowhere near enough yesterday, today is another day, though. Goal is to finish the whole water bottle and all of the tea.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Family:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Am I neglecting any familial obligations?</p>
<p>I guess I’m not listening to the new album quite as much as I maybe should be.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Movement:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Am I stretching at least 5 minutes per hour of computer time?</p>
<p>I did not, though I did get far closer yesterday. If anything, the fact that I had such limited motivation really helped with that, because I could always use stretching as a way to be productive while procrastinating</p></li>
<li><p>Am I generally making efforts to be limber?</p>
<p>I think so! I spent a solid 20 minutes stretching last night and a few minutes this morning vaguely stretching. I know that I’m slowly tightening up again, which I don’t like, though.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Spirituality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Time for prayer?</p>
<p>No</p></li>
<li><p>Prayer?</p>
<p>No</p></li>
<li><p>Time for sacred silence?</p>
<p>No</p></li>
<li><p>Deep breaths?</p>
<p>I’m generally doing it, at least as I read these daily reflections. Outside of that, though, I don’t know.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Secondary Priorities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Thesis/ Ph.D. work:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Keeping up on the writing deadlines?</p>
<p>I realized yesterday that I don’t really have an internal image of where my thesis currently stands and what it needs. With that in mind, I printed out a copy of the thesis as it stood yesterday to see what I have.</p></li>
<li><p>Reading the necessary things?</p>
<p>I brought more textbooks to the camp today, which might help.</p></li>
<li><p>Making graphs?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Visual depiction of Latin Hypercube</p></li>
<li><p>Visual depiction of Grid Search</p></li>
<li><p>Visual depiction of random search</p></li>
<li><p>Visual depiction of Loomis-Wood Diagrams</p></li>
<li><p>Visual depiction of Spectral Stacking</p></li>
<li><p>Visual depiction of how the fitness of the spectral stacks is really reliant on the graphs being the right height</p></li>
<li><p>I guess that the stuff for intro to quantum video counts here.</p></li>
<li><p>Plots from the actual results of the runs, to make sure that it worked out.<a href="#fn024" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref4"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Organizing citations?</p>
<p>I spent a little bit of time yesterday, and I also realized that I had not ever actually made the .bib file for the thesis, so set that up as well.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Love:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Taking risks?</p>
<p>Marginally!</p></li>
<li><p>Making efforts?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Typing Practice?</p>
<p>Yeah! I like doing it first thing in the morning. However, I do also know that the morning is my most productive time, so a large part of me feels some bits of guilt about not using the time to be productive. Hard to know what the correct thing to do is, though.</p></li>
<li><p>Applying to jobs?</p>
<p>Not so much. I have a meeting with the career office this afternoon about an application which is due tomorrow, so that’s existentially terrifying.</p>
<p>What if they don’t want me? Even worse, what if they do!</p></li>
<li><p>Reading the things I think could be good?</p>
<p>Eh, not as much as might be good. I want to understand how rotational transitions work, and I want to describe that in my thesis. I’m just not sure how much of an explicit derivation I should/want to/can have. It’s certainly a lower priority than other things I could be doing.</p></li>
<li><p>Making manim videos?</p>
<p>Nope! That’s something I could work on when I run out of energy today though!</p></li>

<li><p>Cleaning?</p>

<li><p>Office</p>
<p>Remains fine because I’m not there.</p></li>
<li><p>Home</p>
<p>Minor efforts, and I found out that Monday is Memorial day, so that should help! Nominally not allowed to be at work, which means that I can really focus on cleaning the home.<a href="#fn025" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Shoot! I’m giving an outreach talk on Friday and Saturday, which means that I need to have it cleaned.</p></li>
<li><p>Computer</p>
<p>Not a ton, but a little bit last night.</p></li>
<li><p>Other as needed</p>
<p>I don’t think that there’s much else. I guess my thoughts and life and thesis, which I have done a little bit of.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>External Obligations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Guitar for wedding?</p>
<p>I realized yesterday that I want stepwise and fourth-wise motions. If I limit myself to major chords, that means that I only have twelve chords at most, and since most of them are symmetric<a href="#fn026" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref6"><sup>6</sup></a>, there’s really not that much to do. Since I don’t realllly want to be moving all around the neck, that limits the chords even further. That being said, I do still need to be spending time on it.</p></li>
<li><p>Travel plans?</p>
<p>Nope!</p></li>
<li><p>Talks for parks?</p>
<p>Signed up for a few more, so I think that I’ve officially set up at least as many talks this summer as I have before this summer.</p></li>
<li><p>Other requested talks?</p>
<p>Not at all!</p></li>
<li><p>Talks for conferences?</p>
<p>Yesterday while in my mood of existential dread I made the “dream talk, minimal viable talk, realistic talk, stretch talk” outline.<a href="#fn027" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref7"><sup>7</sup></a> I have about a month until the conference, which is both too long to feel urgent and also not long enough to be able to feel comfortable with procrastinating it in full.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Tertiary Goals:<a href="#fn028" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Blogging?</p>
<p>I’m going to get this post out today, and I will commit to that.</p></li>
<li><p>Reading?</p>
<p>I have been churning through the Cradle series again, which is fun.</p></li>
<li><p>Web Noveling?</p>
<p>As with blogging, I’m going to get a chapter done today. I will also do everything in my power to get another chapter done tomorrow, and a third done Friday. I don’t know when, exactly, would be best for me to do that, but we’ll see if it’s possible. I think that I really need to just accept that even though they tell us to stop working after boot camp ends, it’s only 4pm which means that I do, in fact, have a lot of the day left to do things. Might also want to go on a long walk tonight! Oh wait, today is burger night, hmm.</p></li>
<li><p>Guitar?</p>
<p>Played three fishers this morning, which was fun. I love the way that things sound when I’m still primarily asleep.</p></li>
<li><p>Other hobbies?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Quaternary Goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Letter writing</p>
<p>Nope!</p></li>
<li><p>Handwriting/penmanship</p>
<p>This week is dissertation camp, and I realize that I’ve been doing a lot of handwriting. I’m not totally sure why it is that writing things by hands makes my life go better, but wow do I need things to be hand written.</p></li>
<li><p>Picking a new signature</p>
<p>Honestly, I don’t think that this should be an entry any longer, because wow I do not make progress on it.</p></li>

<h1 id="on-melody-and-harmony"><a href="melody-harmony.html">On Melody and Harmony</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2025 May 7</p>
<h1 id="draft-3-2025-may-7">Draft 3: 2025 May 7</h1>
<p>The previous drafts have been a lot more meandering than I’m used to lately, and I think that part of the reason is that this post was really amorphous in my mind. Rather than the standard folly, where I have something I know I want to express and find the way to do so, I don’t know if I ever really knew what I was trying to express in the previous drafts. Thankfully, whatever net I cast still managed to bring back something worthwhile to gnaw on.<a href="#fn031" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Like many people, I struggle with imposter syndrome at times. These days, I find it happening almost exclusively in musical realms, and almost entirely when it comes to performance. In many regards, I can acknowledge the feeling as ridiculous. I am not trying to make a living doing music, so of course I am not as good as those who do. I know what would help my ear, and I actively choose not to do it.<a href="#fn032" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>If I was just generally not as great as music as I wanted, I think that I would be more comfortable. However, I do also have some amount of pride<a href="#fn033" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref3"><sup>3</sup></a> in my ability to compose, which I think is where the cognitive dissonance comes in. Every professional composer I’ve spoken to is pretty clear about the necessity of not just being able to hear the harmonies and melodies one writes as they enter the page, but of being able to hear the absent harmonies.<a href="#fn034" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref4"><sup>4</sup></a> I can, at least most of the time, relatively accurately hear any individual melodic line in my writing. I can, however, almost never hear the harmonies.</p>
<p>As I write a piece for a dear friend’s wedding, I am finding the absolute limits of my ability to compose without paper. The frets of the guitar are welcoming and encourage certain harmonies and melodies. When I am away from it, though, I can still think about where my fingers and hand will need to be in order to make notes. So, I guess that the takeaway is that I need to accept that I cannot compose without paper, even though that hurts to admit. When composing for choir, I need an active audio playback.</p>
<h1 id="draft-2-2025-may-6">Draft 2: 2025 May 6</h1>
<p>When I was going into my senior year of college, I was debating different career options. Because I was formed for academia<a href="#fn035" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref5"><sup>5</sup></a>, I knew that meant I wanted to go to graduate school next. Being a major in music with a love for composition and chemistry with a love for quantum and analytical, I asked professors what I was missing to be a good applicant to graduate school and generally successful in the industry. When we had visiting musicians, I did the same.<a href="#fn036" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>I don’t remember what I was missing to be a good chemist, other than I think literal information. There was probably something like “be better at your lab notebook”, which I have not really done, but.</p>
<p>To be a successful composer, though, every professor and visiting musician I talked to had the exact same answer: a better ear was essential. Even outside of composing, the different performance based professors I worked with were often shocked at just how bad my pitch memory was.<a href="#fn037" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref7"><sup>7</sup></a> My ear is not great, and I have no real desire to do the work essential to training it. Back in college, before I had matured and learned the value of suffering<a href="#fn038" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref8"><sup>8</sup></a>, I was even less willing.</p>
<p>And so, two futures of mine diverged and I took the one of least resistance.<a href="#fn039" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref9"><sup>9</sup></a> That spring, I then won a composition award from the music department. As it turns out, even though I do not have an emotional idea of what each interval is, nor can I play 11 notes on a piano and say which one is missing,<a href="#fn0310" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref10"><sup>10</sup></a> I can still write music that makes the academy happy. Given the general reception to the songs I’ve written since then, I can also write music that makes the average person happy too. The only issue is that I cannot do it without a pencil and paper.</p>
<p>I can improvise lyric if I need to, and can figure out what should come next if given parts of a line. Given a melodic fragment, though, I cannot put the end on a guitar.</p>
<p>As I write a piece for my friend’s wedding, this is coming up constantly. I am nearly positive that what I want is just some scalar walking between different chords, but don’t have an idea in my hands or head how to do that when looking at the fretboard. What little I have been able to do past the moment of inspiration has been because I actively paused and reminded myself what chords were what scalar<a href="#fn0311" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref11"><sup>11</sup></a> distances from each other and how I could walk between them. Still, the more I did that, the less the new parts felt like something good.</p>
<p>I’m sure that if and when I go and put the notes in my sheet music editor, I will immediately know what I can do to make the song last forever. I love programmatic music, and especially for something which is meant to be somewhat ambient, having a number of touch points with transitions is great.<a href="#fn0312" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref12"><sup>12</sup></a> I can easily string a bunch of riffs or licks together, but need to have them first.</p>
<p>What was the point of this folly?</p>
<p>Really mostly me coming to terms with the fact that I don’t intuit musical instruments like I do sheet paper. That does, in my heart of hearts, make me feel like less of a musician, but it probably isn’t something horrible and worthy of despair. I don’t think that I value the skills of composing on an instrument enough to work on them, so I guess it would behoove<a href="#fn0313" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref13"><sup>13</sup></a> me to internalize that I am ok with this fact.</p>
<p>I don’t know how I feel about this musing right now, so may revisit it before posting tonight. With two minutes until the end of the hour, I’ll call it here, though. On to the thesis.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-2025-may-6">Draft 1: 2025 May 6</h1>
<p>While writing with my dear friend this morning, they commented that I have not been posting here lately. That’s not incorrect.</p>
<p>Part of me feels like any writing I do here is writing that would otherwise be done on my thesis, which is not totally incorrect. There are only so many thoughts my brain can capture, break in, and pin to the page in a given day. However, I also know that I feel more grounded if I do these follies, and that being grounded lets me capture more thoughts. With that in mind, I’m going to consciously choose to spend the remainder of this working hour<a href="#fn0314" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref14"><sup>14</sup></a> writing this. If it doesn’t get me to the point that I want, I’ll try to return to it later.</p>
<p>So, what do I want to say about melody and harmony?</p>
<p>I was talking with a friend this weekend about how we write music. She has a great intuition and ear, and just sings what feels natural. I am so far from that, at least in general.</p>
<p>Sure, most of my songs begin with randomly singing a line or even just a few bars. However, what comes next is that I have to painfully figure out exactly what relative and absolute pitches I sang<a href="#fn0315" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref15"><sup>15</sup></a>. Even then, I only have a single line of music.</p>
<p>What comes next is the part of composition that I have always found easiest: composition on the staff. I am a product of the modern era, and really love having automatic playback. However, if I am away from my computer, I can write more pleasing melodic lines simply by using a staff than I tend to be able to do without the paper in front of me. I don’t know what about me is well trained to write music.</p>
<p>Having written that sentence, I do realize that’s untrue. I have spent a lot of time in my life explicitly and actively studying the melodies that I enjoy or dislike. Almost all of that study has been score study, which means that I have, at the absolute minimum, a good internal intuition of what a melody should look like on the page. Add to that the fact that I have internalized the formal rules that people have written over the ages for melodies that sound good<a href="#fn0316" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref16"><sup>16</sup></a>, and I guess that it should be no surprise that I can quickly jot down something that I like for a single voice.</p>
<p>Harmony is always something that comes later to me, which I attribute in equal parts to my high school choral experience and general love of early music. Both of these sources center melody, and have harmony fall out as a consequence, rather than the reverse, as is more common to the academic composer.</p>
<p>In playing guitar, though, most of what I’ve learned is various folk and folk adjacent<a href="#fn0317" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref17"><sup>17</sup></a> songs by looking at chord sheets. I have mostly internalized standard variations on the 145 progression, which is certainly not bad, especially since most of what I write is folk and folk adjacent. Right now, though, I’m trying to write a piece for solo guitar for a friend’s wedding.</p>
<p>In a stroke of inspiration late one night, I found a riff I really liked. The warm light of morning showed me it was just a walk up from A to D in tenths, which made figuring out some next options easy enough. However, because I do so little work with melody on guitar, I find that nothing I’m doing feels particularly natural. I’ve practiced enough scales that I can look at a tab and follow it, but apparently not enough to have internalized it.</p>
<p>So, what does this mean for me?</p>
<p>I want to work on transcribing it, because I feel like it will help with getting the progression through. Right now I feel like what I have is alternating melody and fingerpicked harmony, which is not necessarily a problem. Ideally, though, I think that I’d like there to be more of a melodic line throughout, if only because that is familiar.</p>
<h1 id="draft-0-2025-may-5">Draft 0: 2025 May 5</h1>
<p>I’ve talked a fair amount in the past about how I write music, and especially how I’m writing a piece for a friend’s wedding. While lying in bed late one night, I awoke with inspiration for the hook for the piece I’m going to play this fall. Figuring out what comes next, though, has really been a struggle.</p>
<h1 id="daily-reflection-57">Daily Reflection 5/7</h1>
<ol>
<li><p>Top Priorities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sleep:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Keeping sleep time sacred?</p>
<p>I think so! I saw that it was around 9 pm yesterday so put the computer and whatnot away and went to sleep. When I woke up between 2 and 4, I didn’t get back on my phone, even if I did check my watch for the few notifications it had.</p></li>
<li><p>Good sleep hygiene?</p>
<p>Eh, I was watching youtube in bed last night. Still, didn’t use electronics when woke up in the middle of the night, which is a win in and of itself.</p></li>
<li><p>Sleeping enough?</p>
<p>Yeah! I woke up completely naturally at like 615, and I was unable to keep my eyes closed, so that’s a good sign that I’m finally recovering from my sleep deficit.</p></li>
<li><p>How well rested do I feel?</p>
<p>Decently! I feel pretty good, but I also haven’t left my home yet, so it’s a little hard to know how much of that is that I’m actually well rested and how much is that I haven’t done anything at all.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Feed myself:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I eat breakfast?</p>
<p>Yesterday I had some matzah! Today I um plan to eat by 1030, because that’s where I penciled in food for the day. Given how hungry I am now, though, might not be a bad idea to eat earlier.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I eat a second meal?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I eat dinner?</p>
<p>Yesterday I did! Had pizza.</p></li>
<li><p>Water?</p>
<p>Nowhere near enough. My water bottle is nearly empty, so I really should<a href="#fn0318" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref18"><sup>18</sup></a> refill it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Family:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Am I neglecting any familial obligations?</p>
<p>Nope!</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Movement:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Am I stretching at least 5 minutes per hour of computer time?</p>
<p>I did not stretch for the final like 2 or 3 hours at home, and it was clear that I felt so drained from that fact.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I generally making efforts to be limber?</p>
<p>I stretched this morning before this, and it felt good. Currently trying to do some foot stretches because they still hurt. I’m hoping it’s not stress fractures, but who can say.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Spirituality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Time for prayer?</p>
<p>Nope.</p></li>
<li><p>Prayer?</p>
<p>Nope.</p></li>
<li><p>Time for sacred silence?</p>
<p>Nope.</p></li>
<li><p>Deep breaths?</p>
<p>Generally actually did ok with this one yesterday! Woo one of four.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Secondary Priorities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Thesis/ Ph.D. work:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Keeping up on the writing deadlines?</p>
<p>Eh, I thought that I wanted to do one piece of writing a day and then did not do it yesterday. Still, I am generating a fair amount of content, and there’s absolutely something to be said for the importance of organizing things before I just work on the project. Where the line is between being productive by planning and procrastinating by planning, I’m not completely sure, but I think that I’m still very much on the side of benefiting from planning more.</p>
<p>What are the current things I want to write?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Draft of video one of youtube. Internal/nominal due date: Friday 5/9.</p></li>
<li><p>Science Communication Thesis Chapter Draft. Internal/nominal due date: Friday 5/9.</p></li>
<li><p>RebelFit Introduction Thesis Chapter Draft. Internal/nominal due date: Friday 5/9.</p></li>
<li><p>RebelFit Background Thesis Chapter Draft. Internal/nominal due date: Friday 5/9.</p></li>
<li><p>Publicly Reachable Thesis Chapter Draft. Internal/nominal due date: Friday 5/9. Hmm, can I count the things that I’m doing as an animation for that? Maybe. Still want to do it as a writing chapter, though, in case the boss isn’t keen on the idea.</p></li>
<li><p>RebelFit Results Thesis Chapter Draft. Internal/nominal due date: Friday 5/9.</p></li>
<li><p>Background subtraction got weird, because one of the species didn’t seem to appear in the spectrum. I realized that I’ve been working with a small subset of the spectrum, rather than the entire thing, though, which probably isn’t helping.<a href="#fn0319" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Reading the necessary things?</p></li>
<li><p>Making graphs?</p>
<p>Not at all</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Visual depiction of Latin Hypercube</p></li>
<li><p>Visual depiction of Grid Search</p></li>
<li><p>Visual depiction of random search</p></li>
<li><p>Visual depiction of Loomis-Wood Diagrams</p></li>
<li><p>Visual depiction of Spectral Stacking</p></li>
<li><p>Visual depiction of how the fitness of the spectral stacks is really reliant on the graphs being the right height</p></li>
<li><p>I guess that the stuff for intro to quantum video counts here.</p></li>
<li><p>Plots from the actual results of the runs, to make sure that it worked out.<a href="#fn0320" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref20"><sup>20</sup></a>.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Organizing citations?</p>
<p>Nope!</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Love:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Taking risks?</p>
<p>Oh! Minorly, actually.</p></li>
<li><p>Making efforts?</p>
<p>Nope</p></li>
<li><p>Showing affection?</p>
<p>Decently!</p></li>
<li><p>Being honest?</p>
<p>Yeah!</p></li>
<li><p>Being open?</p>
<p>Yeah!</p></li>
<li><p>Being appropriately vulnerable?</p>
<p>I think so</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Adjacent to Primary and Secondary:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Typing Practice?</p>
<p>Did so this morning. Lots of work on C and Z, with a little on Q at the very very end.</p></li>
<li><p>Post-its being maintained?</p>
<p>Kind of! Realizing that the way I’m doing post-its might not be ideal. Yesterday I did some pseudo-assigned reading for the writing camp I’m attending, and all of the advice seemed to really stress having a good schedule. I have a nice bulletin board that I have been trying to figure out how to use.<a href="#fn0321" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Putting all the notes on it with dates might not be the worst idea! I think that I would need to break the time down into the rest of the week, month, and degree? Have three rows, and then spend some time each morning shifting things around? Maybe? Will see how the motivation takes me.</p></li>
<li><p>Applying to jobs?</p>
<p>Nothing new here from yesterday.</p></li>
<li><p>Reading the things I think could be good?</p>
<p>Nope! Today I actually scheduled time for it, though, which is probably going to be helpful.<a href="#fn0322" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Making manim videos?</p>
<p>Nope.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Cleaning?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Office</p>
<p>Made sure it was good before I left yesterday, and will not be in today, so hoping to have it remain good.</p></li>
<li><p>Home</p>
<p>Scheduled time to do so today. I don’t entirely know what it would mean for me to be all caught up with cleaning, but I think that, at the very least, it would involve vacuuming?</p></li>
<li><p>Car</p>
<p>I’m finally going to take the bulletin board out! That’s something.</p></li>
<li><p>Computer</p>
<p>Not really, though not sure if I really need it.</p></li>
<li><p>Other as needed</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>External Obligations:</p>

<li><p>Guitar for wedding?</p>
<p>Scheduled time to transcribe it today, and will finish the musing about it above.</p></li>

<li><p>Talks for parks?</p>
<p>Two more have been scheduled.</p></li>
<li><p>Other requested talks?</p></li>

</ul></li>
<li><p>Tertiary Goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Blogging?</p>
<p>I’m finally going to post this one.</p></li>
<li><p>Reading?</p>
<p>Nope, but I think that part of it is that I’m not reading anything worthwhile right now.<a href="#fn0323" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Web Noveling?</p>
<p>No, but I would like to get back into it. Thankfully, the bulletin board<a href="#fn0324" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref24"><sup>24</sup></a> has my notes from before giving up.</p></li>
<li><p>Guitar?</p>
<p>Spent a solid few minutes last night working through a few exercises. I’m getting better at reading staff notation for the guitar, which feels really nice, if also more than a little strange.</p></li>
<li><p>Other hobbies?</p>
<p>Not so much.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Quaternary Goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Letter writing</p>
<p>I’m thinking about bringing the books that I want to be reading to my cage, so that I can have more of a reason to visit it. There’s something to be said about scheduling a default day which involves time there. I just really wish that it was open before 830 AM. Tragically, however, it appears that the building is the only space that has them available. Still, the 24/7 library is only like a block away, so if I started the morning there, could always shift to the library with my things later in the morning.<a href="#fn0325" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Handwriting/penmanship</p>
<p>Yeah! I have generally been handwriting things, even if I haven’t been doing the loops and lines as much. The letters are getting gradually more even, and in general I think that I’m liking how the penmanship is developing. It is still really weird to be writing in lower case letters, and I do still catch myself returning to block capitals, but.</p></li>

<h1 id="daily-reflection-56">Daily Reflection 5/6</h1>
<ol>
<li><p>Top Priorities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sleep:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Keeping sleep time sacred?</p>
<p>Yeah! I was spending time with a friend last night, so it could have easily spiraled out. Luckily they also respect their rest, and so I was politely encouraged to leave at an appropriate hour. I then went to sleep.</p></li>
<li><p>Good sleep hygiene?</p>
<p>Yeah! Went to sleep! Didn’t do bed rot.</p></li>
<li><p>Sleeping enough?</p>
<p>About another 11 hours last night, which I hope brings me closer to a healthy level of total rest.</p></li>
<li><p>How well rested do I feel?</p>
<p>Generally ok! Still hurts to walk, but that’s really the only thing slowing me down right now.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Feed myself:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I eat breakfast?</p>
<p>Yesterday! Today I’m planning to eat it later.</p>
<p>Oh! I also had a few chocolates this morning. Look at me, feeding myself.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I eat a second meal?</p>
<p>Yesterday! I had dinner with friends.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I eat dinner?</p>
<p>Dinner was two full meals worth, so I’ll count it double.</p></li>
<li><p>Water?</p>
<p>Generally ok? I think that I went through a full two liters of tea yesterday. Today I’m hitting a nice 15 ounces of espresso, which will hopefully both improve my productivity and desire to consume water. I do really prefer cool to cold water over room temperature, which is good for me to know, even if it not particularly actionable. I think that my electrolytes might be generally out of whack lately, which might mean that I shouldn’t be chugging water so much as making sure that I also maybe like eat teaspoons of salt with them?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Family:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Am I neglecting any familial obligations?</p>
<p>Nope! Need to listen to an album sometime this week, but will find space and time for that, I’m sure.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Movement:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Am I stretching at least 5 minutes per hour of computer time?</p>
<p>Generally did ok with this yesterday, though I did ignore the last two or three hours of yesterday’s time. That’s not great, but also like I frame the activity much more as taking a break from work than actually stretching, which is probably wrong, but does explain at least part of it, to me at least.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I generally making efforts to be limber?</p>
<p>Yeah! Even when just sitting down, finding that I want to move more and more is probably good. Also like wow my shoulders are tight, and so did some stretching while walking. That felt nice, and so I’ll probably spend more time today focusing on feet and shoulders, since those are my big areas of note<a href="#fn0326" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref26"><sup>26</sup></a>.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Spirituality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Time for prayer?</p>
<p>Not really, kind of filling my day.</p></li>
<li><p>Prayer?</p>
<p>As a result, not really.</p></li>
<li><p>Time for sacred silence?</p>
<p>Nope! Wow I have done nothing with intentional quiet.</p></li>
<li><p>Deep breaths?</p>
<p>Not really, which I don’t like in the slightest. Maybe I should remind myself with the stretching to also breathe.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Secondary Priorities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Thesis/ Ph.D. work:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Keeping up on the writing deadlines?</p>
<p>What are the current things I want to write? Oh boy are there a lot of them, and I think that the goal is going to be the rebelfit intro/background, since I’m not sure how what I write is going to end up. Mostly going to focus on the whole “this is a list of algorithms I didn’t use” for now.</p>
<p>Yesterday I also said that I wanted to get the new jobs resubmitted. Part of me wants to wait on that, but I think that’s just the part of me that is terrified of success. Going on the list!<a href="#fn0327" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Draft of video one of youtube. Internal/nominal due date: Friday 5/9.</p>
<p>Would also be good to have this? Will spend time on it if I have extra energy after finishing the draft and submitting the jobs.</p></li>
<li><p>Science Communication Thesis Chapter Draft. Internal/nominal due date: Friday 5/9.</p></li>
<li><p>RebelFit Introduction Thesis Chapter Draft. Internal/nominal due date: Friday 5/9.</p></li>
<li><p>RebelFit Background Thesis Chapter Draft. Internal/nominal due date: Friday 5/9.</p>
<p>I really don’t know if I can adequately differentiate this from the above, but hopefully it will clarify itself as I write.</p></li>
<li><p>Publicly Reachable Thesis Chapter Draft. Internal/nominal due date: Friday 5/9. Hmm, can I count the things that I’m doing as an animation for that? Maybe. Still want to do it as a writing chapter, though, in case the boss isn’t keen on the idea.</p></li>
<li><p>RebelFit Results Thesis Chapter Draft. Internal/nominal due date: Friday 5/9.</p></li>
<li><p>I guess that I should probably also put here: “Do the background species subtraction and resubmit those jobs”, which I will nominally deadline at tomorrow, 5/6, because I think that I should do that today.</p></li>
<li><p>Introduction to Spectroscopy, especially rotational spectroscopy, both as classical and quantum framed. Let’s say due 5/7.</p>
<p>I did this one yesterday! That means that it gets to be removed from the list! Woo!</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Reading the necessary things?</p>
<p>I think that I don’t really need to be reading (read: I should not be reading)<a href="#fn0328" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref28"><sup>28</sup></a> I should reorganize the Zotero, but that’s not a high importance or urgency task.<a href="#fn0329" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Making graphs?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Visual depiction of Latin Hypercube</p></li>
<li><p>Visual depiction of Grid Search</p></li>
<li><p>Visual depiction of random search</p></li>
<li><p>Visual depiction of Loomis-Wood Diagrams</p></li>
<li><p>Visual depiction of Spectral Stacking</p></li>
<li><p>Visual depiction of how the fitness of the spectral stacks is really reliant on the graphs being the right height</p></li>
<li><p>I guess that the stuff for intro to quantum video counts here.</p></li>
<li><p>Ope! Plots from the actual results of the runs, to make sure that it worked out.<a href="#fn0330" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref30"><sup>30</sup></a>. Post-it time.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Organizing citations?</p>
<p>Hah.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Love:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Taking risks?</p>
<p>Kind of! The very slightest of risk yesterday, and it went well, which is, in retrospect, unsurprising.</p></li>
<li><p>Making efforts?</p>
<p>I think so! At the very least remembering what it means to make efforts.</p></li>
<li><p>Showing affection?</p>
<p>Yeah! I think appropriate amounts no less.</p></li>
<li><p>Being honest?</p>
<p>Generally! It was really weird to write with my friend this morning and find that they were so willing to be helpful.<a href="#fn0331" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Being open?</p>
<p>Yeah! I think it’s funny that I separate these two, because one would hope that they’re synonymous, and in my mind they certainly approach it. However, there’s some part of me that reacts to the words differently, so I’ll leave it for now.</p></li>
<li><p>Being appropriately vulnerable?</p>
<p>Yeah!</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Adjacent to Primary and Secondary:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Typing Practice?</p>
<p>Will do now! Lots of work on the letter q. Sadly, the letter C was again an issue, and I even had a few lessons with Z. Generally looks faster than yesterday, which is nice. Perhaps unsurprisingly, focusing on the letter q did mean that my relative accuracy for it went down. I’m sure it’ll rise up again as I keep working, but for now it is somewhat low.</p></li>
<li><p>Post-its being maintained?</p>
<p>I think so! Lost the list of post its from yesterday, which is a little sad and scary, but I’m sure they will turn up when I return to the office.</p></li>
<li><p>Applying to jobs?</p>
<p>Set up two meetings with the career office, one this Thursday so I can ask what should go in the materials and one next week so I can make sure that what I’ve put in them is good!</p></li>
<li><p>Reading the things I think could be good?</p>
<p>Nope!</p></li>
<li><p>Making manim videos?</p>
<p>Nope!</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Cleaning?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Office</p>
<p>Spent a good twenty or so minutes yesterday doing so, felt nice, meant that I could work at my desk. It feels like all the work has disappeared since then. The curse of entropy rears its head again.</p></li>
<li><p>Home</p>
<p>I did not get home until bed time last night, so did not. Today I will try to make time after work!</p></li>
<li><p>Car</p>
<p>none</p></li>
<li><p>Computer</p>
<p>Not really, but will plan to do some today. Oof I get a <strong>lot</strong> of emails that actually require responses.</p></li>
<li><p>Other as needed</p>
<p>Don’t think any right now!</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>External Obligations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Guitar for wedding?</p>
<p>Subject of the above musing!</p></li>
<li><p>Travel plans?</p>
<p>Have reached out to some people!</p></li>
<li><p>Talks for parks?</p>
<p>Have signed up for more!</p></li>
<li><p>Other requested talks?</p>
<p>Nope!</p></li>
<li><p>Talks for conferences?</p>
<p>Nope!</p></li>

<li><p>Tertiary Goals:<a href="#fn0332" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>

<li><p>Web Noveling?</p>
<p>Nope! Thinking about it, and trying to remember where I last left off, though.</p></li>
<li><p>Guitar?</p>
<p>Noodled a bit this morning. As I figure out my schedule, will try to be better at actually practicing.</p></li>
<li><p>Other hobbies?</p>
<p>Going to set aside some time today to work on poetry/song lyric.<a href="#fn0334" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Quaternary Goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Letter writing</p>
<p>Nope!</p></li>
<li><p>Handwriting/penmanship</p>
<p>Yeah! I did some work yesterday, and today I’m working on it in the sense of thinking about what I write as I do. I think that I do really want to keep the capital A that I’ve had since college, since I have actively been complimented on it before. I’m not totally sure if it fits the vibe of the other letters that I’m making, though, so that’s something to certainly consider.</p></li>
<li><p>Picking a new signature</p>
<p>None.</p></li>

</ol>
<h1 id="daily-reflection-55">Daily Reflection 5/5</h1>
<ol>
<li><p>Top Priorities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sleep:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Keeping sleep time sacred?</p>
<p>OOf.</p>
<p>I went on a long walk/camping trip. Both because we had early mornings and because no one else in my life loves early bedtimes, I did not do great with that over the Friday and Saturday nights. Last night, however, I think I went to bed or sleep by 8, and I do feel significantly more human.</p></li>
<li><p>Good sleep hygiene?</p>
<p>Generally! I think at least. One plus side of camping, there is maximal incentive to minimize time in sleeping bag when not sleeping.</p></li>
<li><p>Sleeping enough?</p>
<p>Uhhhhh.</p>
<p>No, I don’t think, but also like that may just be physical body muscle repair rather than actual need for sleep.<a href="#fn0335" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>How well rested do I feel?</p>
<p>Generally ok. Woke up feeling well rested this morning and ran out of energy halfway to work.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Feed myself:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I eat breakfast?</p>
<p>On it right now! Ate something approximating breakfast on Saturday and Sunday.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I eat a second meal?</p>
<p>On Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, yes!</p></li>
<li><p>Did I eat dinner?</p>
<p>I slept through dinner last night, other wise yesish.</p></li>
<li><p>Water?</p>
<p>Nowhere near enough, but much more than normal.<a href="#fn0336" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Family:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Am I neglecting any familial obligations?</p>
<p>I don’t think so! Generally doing ok as far as I can tell.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Movement:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Am I stretching at least 5 minutes per hour of computer time?</p>
<p>Not yesterday, but in general yes. Today I’m absolutely going to try to.</p>
<p>Also, realized that I do tend to do a fair amount of foot stretching while I sit at my desk, especially today, where my feet are in incredible pain.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I generally making efforts to be limber?</p>
<p>With how tight my entire body is right now, absolutely, even though it does feel like I’m tighter than ever before.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Spirituality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Time for prayer?</p>
<p>Yeah! As a group we decided to do the four sets of rosary mysteries during the walk, so 200 Aves.</p></li>
<li><p>Prayer?</p>
<p>As above.</p></li>
<li><p>Time for sacred silence?</p>
<p>Ehhhhhhhh. One plus side of being with a group is that there’s no need for silence. I’ll try to get back into it today, though, because wow I need to feel grounded again.</p></li>
<li><p>Deep breaths?</p>
<p>I think so! Certainly right now as I remember.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Secondary Priorities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Thesis/ Ph.D. work:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Keeping up on the writing deadlines?</p>
<p>I sent in a paper draft and some chapter drafts in last week. What are the current things I want to write?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Draft of video one of youtube. Internal/nominal due date: Friday 5/9.</p></li>
<li><p>Science Communication Thesis Chapter Draft. Internal/nominal due date: Friday 5/9.</p></li>
<li><p>RebelFit Introduction Thesis Chapter Draft. Internal/nominal due date: Friday 5/9.</p></li>
<li><p>RebelFit Background Thesis Chapter Draft. Internal/nominal due date: Friday 5/9.</p></li>
<li><p>Publicly Reachable Thesis Chapter Draft. Internal/nominal due date: Friday 5/9. Hmm, can I count the things that I’m doing as an animation for that? Maybe. Still want to do it as a writing chapter, though, in case the boss isn’t keen on the idea.</p></li>
<li><p>RebelFit Results Thesis Chapter Draft. Internal/nominal due date: Friday 5/9.</p></li>
<li><p>I guess that I should probably also put here: “Do the background species subtraction and resubmit those jobs”, which I will nominally deadline at tomorrow, 5/6, because I think that I should do that today.<a href="#fn0337" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Introduction to Spectroscopy, especially rotational spectroscopy, both as classical and quantum framed. Let’s say due 5/7.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Reading the necessary things?</p>
<p>Don’t think that there’s a ton to read other than the spectroscopy and quantum books insofar as they can help me with the videos and background.</p></li>
<li><p>Making graphs?</p>
<p>I need to make a lot of graphs. What, though?<a href="#fn0338" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Visual depiction of Latin Hypercube</p></li>
<li><p>Visual depiction of Grid Search</p></li>
<li><p>Visual depiction of random search<a href="#fn0339" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Visual depiction of Loomis-Wood Diagrams<a href="#fn0340" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Visual depiction of Spectral Stacking<a href="#fn0341" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Visual depiction of how the fitness of the spectral stacks is really reliant on the graphs being the right height</p></li>
<li><p>I guess that the stuff for intro to quantum video counts here.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For now, not going to put deadlines, because don’t really think that any are necessarily essential<a href="#fn0342" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Organizing citations?</p>
<p>I have not made progress on this, but would like to do so today. At the very least, as I read the rotational and quantum books, make sure that their info is in a new zotero folder.<a href="#fn0343" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Love:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Taking risks?</p>
<p>Not really any, though I guess that I did try to set up meetings, even if not romantic, with people.</p></li>
<li><p>Making efforts?</p>
<p>As above, though also tried to get myself back into the habit of good/intense<a href="#fn0344" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Showing affection?</p>
<p>Oof, not great here. I forgot to ask any of the people I was with this weekend their thoughts on being called love or beloved, and I forgot to ask them how they feel about physical touch.</p></li>
<li><p>Being honest?</p>
<p>I think so! I tried to not deflect, at least. I did also go to confession for the first time since my mom’s funeral<a href="#fn0345" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref45"><sup>45</sup></a>, which was really hard for reasons I don’t know if I can adequately explain here/want to.</p></li>
<li><p>Being open?</p>
<p>I think so! I was trying to be receptive to others. I had good conversations with strangers during the walk.</p></li>
<li><p>Being appropriately vulnerable?</p>
<p>I don’t think that I was vulnerable appropriately, but it’s a process, not a one off thing, so that’s fine.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Adjacent to Primary and Secondary:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Typing Practice?</p>
<p>Not at all, let’s real quick do that now.</p>
<p>Generally a fair bit slower and less accurate today, but progress was absolutely made. I felt myself becoming smoother with each lesson, and even though it was exclusively p and w lessons, I think that the remaining keys got some good practice. Perhaps unsurprisingly, as I sit better<a href="#fn0346" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref46"><sup>46</sup></a>, I type both faster and more accurately. I should really<a href="#fn0347" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref47"><sup>47</sup></a> go back to the external monitor, because wow is the laptop screen too low for me.</p></li>
<li><p>Post-its being maintained?</p>
<p>Will do just after I do my hourly stretch now!</p>
<p>Before next hour I should look up how to stretch foot, because wow it was cramping continuously.<a href="#fn0348" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Oof there’s a lot of them, and it’s starting to feel overwhelming. Might want to make more categories than “now”, “not now”, “low priority”, or at the very least figure out what I can do.</p></li>
<li><p>Applying to jobs?</p>
<p>Nope! I will make a note for that though.<a href="#fn0349" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Reading the things I think could be good?</p>
<p>Haven’t made much progress there, would like to spend some of tonight or tomorrow doing that, depending on how much work I am able to get done.</p></li>
<li><p>Making manim videos?</p>
<p>Nope! But I did spend a fair amount of time on Friday thinking about how to frame the series and where to start it. I think that “an intuitive explanation of quantum chemistry” feels like a lovely title, assuming that I can make it true. Luckily, someone else in my life expressed that they would love to watch it, not just because they support me, but also because they think that the information could be generally useful.</p>
<p>Also probably want to have something like “market research” meaning looking at the animations and videography I like and dissecting it. I’ll add a post it to the dailies.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Cleaning?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Office</p>
<p>Not yet, but have it on the list to do today. I’ll do after the 10 AM Stretching break.<a href="#fn0350" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Home</p>
<p>Negative amounts. I came in from the walk yesterday, dropped everything down, stripped, and collapsed in bed. Good things to do this week for sure though.</p></li>
<li><p>Car</p>
<p>I have camping stuff in the trunk and not camping stuff not in the trunk, so it’s at least more ordered!</p></li>
<li><p>Computer</p>
<p>Nope! Will do so today after the 11am stretch.<a href="#fn0351" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Other as needed</p>
<p>Generally I think that’s everything. I guess “go to confession” counts as cleaning the soul!</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>External Obligations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Guitar for wedding?</p>
<p>I have more ideas for the piece, and plan to start transcribing it, because that should help with the composition.<a href="#fn0352" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Travel plans?</p>
<p>Nope! Get hotel room is officially high priority, and message each of four groups of friends becomes medium.</p></li>
<li><p>Talks for parks?</p>
<p>Nope! I think that working on the animation for manim would be a good start, though, and at worst I’m comfortable with last year’s slides.</p></li>
<li><p>Other requested talks?</p>
<p>Nope! Oh shoot, I should really work on the “how to read science news” talk that was requested.<a href="#fn0353" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Talks for conferences?</p>
<p>As I write and make the graphs I think that I’ll have a lot of this.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Tertiary Goals:<a href="#fn0354" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Blogging?</p>
<p>Wow look at this, which I don’t really know what I’m going to write for the actual text of the post, but I have spent fully 2000 words figuring out the rest of my mind on.</p></li>
<li><p>Reading?</p>
<p>Nope! I did read the very slightest bit of the book on my phone, and I finished the last chapters of the volume of a web novel my brother and I churn through.</p></li>
<li><p>Web Noveling?</p>
<p>Wrote last week’s chapter, have yet to write this week’s.</p></li>
<li><p>Guitar?</p>
<p>Some! Did a little with the whole “learn the actual instrument through the book”, but only the very slightest bit. Probably would be good and healthy and personally helpful for me to schedule time for it.</p></li>
<li><p>Other hobbies?</p>
<p>Nope! I don’t know if I have other hobbies right now, or if I really want them. I guess that I was chatting with someone about song writing over the weekend, so could be good to return to that.<a href="#fn0355" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Quaternary Goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Letter writing</p>
<p>Nope! I will figure out where people live as I plan trips to them, though, which is part of the requirement to sending letters.</p></li>
<li><p>Handwriting/penmanship</p>
<p>A little! Yesterday at the cafe we went to before going home, everyone was very entranced with my pens, which was a fun and weird situation.</p></li>

<h1 id="monthly-reflection"><a href="reflection-april-25.html">Monthly Reflection</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2025 May 1</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Oh boy what a whirlwind of a month!</p>
<p>Five things I was looking forward to last month:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Leading the science experiment this coming Saturday.</p>
<p>Went much better than expected! I had a great time and learned a bunch and it seemed like a bunch of kids did as well.<a href="#fn041" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Going to a friend’s thesis defense</p>
<p>Went! They did a great job and are now a Dr.</p></li>
<li><p>Finishing and submitting my first first author paper</p>
<p>So, some goals may have been more optimistic than others. I do now have the explicit “stop working on optimization” order, which is fine and good I guess, but wow I just feel like there’s a single thing missing from the code to make it perfect.</p></li>
<li><p>Writing more with a close friend</p>
<p>We wrote so much together! It’s been really great, and I’m hopeful that we can continue it into the next month.</p></li>
<li><p>Becoming more of the person that I would like to be, both by changing and by changing my goals.</p>
<p>I don’t really know how much I’ve changed as a person, but I do think that I’ve been setting better goals and living in better alignment to those goals, which is I guess all that it means to become the person I would like to be. Hmm.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Last month I had some overarching goals. Let’s see how we did with those:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Prayer.</p>
<p>Praying in the way that I’ve always done growing up<a href="#fn042" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> remains really difficult. I don’t want to become someone who just says “yeah I feel connected to the Creator when I’m in nature”, but I do think that right now I best become prayerful as I take rest.<a href="#fn043" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Physical Health.</p>
<p>I particularly meant exercise when I started last month, and I certainly have exercised more than I did in the past. According to my tracking, I stretched 21 times last month for more than five minutes at a time. That’s not nothing, but it is also far from the thrice daily I had generally hoped for. Still, anything is better than nothing, and I do absolutely note that I feel markedly better on days when I’ve had a routine of stretching.</p>
<p>I also realized or remembered or refocused on the fact that I need to feed myself. It has remained somewhat difficult, but I continue to improve at it in some marginal sense.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoiding Obsession.</p>
<p>I don’t really know that I did a fantastic job here, but I did do my best to try to structure myself so that I don’t have the chance to obsess and/or set cycles to help break obsession when it comes.</p></li>
<li><p>Intentionality.</p>
<p>I continue to struggle with the idea of scheduling. Part of me thinks that it’s due to the fundamentally flexible nature of most of my day contrasting with my need for rigid timings. That is, arriving at the office between 720 and 740 doesn’t really make a difference, but if my task is then “write for twenty minutes”, then the whole schedule for the day gets thrown off. Also, I don’t really know how long things take.</p>
<p>Part of that is my generic time blindness, part is not knowing how productive the me of tomorrow will be<a href="#fn044" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref4"><sup>4</sup></a>, part is not knowing what distractions will occur<a href="#fn045" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref5"><sup>5</sup></a>, and part is just that I don’t know how long a task would take independent of that. Revising a paper can take anywhere from a few minutes to days of concentrated<a href="#fn046" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref6"><sup>6</sup></a> effort, and I don’t know if there’s a way for me to know which it will be a priori.</p>
<p>However, I do think that I am generally doing better at a macro sense of spending time the way that I want to. Obviously I cannot and will not ever be a perfect time user, only spending time on those activities which absolutely serve the me of the future in the most optimal way. That’s not just pessimism, it’s reality and also knowledge that I do not have perfect future knowledge. What I do now may or may not benefit the me of tomorrow. A random walk down the street instead of working for ten minutes might introduce me to the love of my life.</p></li>
<li><p>Working on hobbies.</p>
<p>Well, that’s not been great. Before Easter, I went on a seven churches walk with a group. Someone asked me what hobbies I have, and I realized that the answer had really been “research that is not what I’m supposed to be doing”. I did read 13 books last month, though<a href="#fn047" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Oh right, a lot of those are books I never had clicked finished on when I did. Ignoring those, we’re at seven, including three audiobooks I mostly listened to because I hate DNFing on something low effort. One of the four actual books I started in February or March. So, I did, in fact, read less last month.<a href="#fn048" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>I kept wanting to do guitar more, and the past few days have felt some inspiration.</p>
<p>I did blog a lot, which is a hobby of a sort. That’s something I did far more reliably than in most prior months.</p>
<p>Stretching is also arguably a hobby, and it’s absolutely something that I did more of.</p>
<p>Ok so maybe I didn’t do that bad at hobbies, after all.</p>
<p>I did also have a weekend spent gaming, which is a thing I chose to do!</p>
<p>OH! I’ve also been getting into pens a fair amount this past month.</p>
<p>Wow ok, so I have done a lot of hobby related activities. They’re just not the hobbies I historically pursued.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I kept a living document of daily reflection goals, which I’ve now sort of stopped. While it was helpful for me then, it was also twenty minutes out of each day that I spent filling it out. Time passes regardless of how I spend it, but I have to wonder whether it’s a good use of my time.<a href="#fn049" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref9"><sup>9</sup></a> I’m going to restart it, but I don’t really necessarily know where my goals might be. That’s not true, but I do suddenly have a much shorter timeline than I thought for my degree, which makes me kind of feel anxious about what all I will need to do. Still, I cannot write if I do not exist, and so let’s structure the goals from that basis.</p>
<p>When I <a href="what-we-dont-write">reflected</a><a href="#fn0410" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref10"><sup>10</sup></a> on my goals for this phase of my life<a href="#fn0411" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref11"><sup>11</sup></a>, I did come up with a tiered list of priorities. Structuring the reflection like that might not be the worst idea.<a href="#fn0412" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Before making my list of daily reflections, let’s think about five things I’m excited for, five SMART<a href="#fn0413" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref13"><sup>13</sup></a> goals, and five general themes I want to shoot for.<a href="#fn0414" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Also, five great things from last month that I didn’t have as listed things last month.</p>
<p>April Highlights</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Had a poker night with friends and managed to end at exactly where I started.<a href="#fn0415" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Went to two<a href="#fn0416" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref16"><sup>16</sup></a> seders, and in general really felt like I connected with my heritage in a way that feels rare to me.<a href="#fn0417" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Got new pen supplies and played with them!</p></li>
<li><p>Made trifle for the first<a href="#fn0418" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref18"><sup>18</sup></a> time! It was easy and very well received.</p></li>
<li><p>Set tentative thesis defense time and then two weeks later moved that up a semester!<a href="#fn0419" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Five things I have to look forward to in May:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Today I TA for the last time, I think ever.<a href="#fn0420" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I have a one week intensive writing camp for my dissertation, which will be fun.<a href="#fn0421" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Giving the opening talk for the set of summer science outreach and communication program that I’m part of. That is, the university partners with state parks to give talks about space over the summer (I know I’ve talked about this before). I’m giving the first of the year (even though it isn’t in a state park, technically).<a href="#fn0422" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Being able to dedicate entire days to a single project, rather than having to always split my attention.<a href="#fn0423" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I’m going on a pilgrimage this weekend! That should be really fun!<a href="#fn0424" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Five quantized<a href="#fn0425" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref25"><sup>25</sup></a> goals for the month:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Finish solid<a href="#fn0426" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref26"><sup>26</sup></a> drafts of at least three chapters of my thesis.</p></li>
<li><p>Write at least one in depth exploration of some theological topic I’ve been wrestling with.<a href="#fn0427" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Do more than 50 greater than 5 minute stretching periods. Right now I have a computer alarm set for the last five minutes of every work hour reminding me to do so, so that should help.</p></li>
<li><p>Write and post at least 20 follies, including this one.</p></li>
<li><p>Apply to five jobs.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Five amorphous ideals for the month, like last month’s “areas I want to focus”<a href="#fn0428" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref28"><sup>28</sup></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Prayer and mindfulness. Figure out what difference, if any, there is between them to me and work to do both more.</p></li>
<li><p>I’ve started tracking my things to do and whatnot<a href="#fn0429" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref29"><sup>29</sup></a> with sticky notes<a href="#fn0430" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref30"><sup>30</sup></a>. Either continue with that, or figure out a better way to track my time and, importantly, track myself and keep myself accountable and productive. I guess this is kind of two, since productivity and organization are not inherently linked, but they sure feel like they are to me.</p></li>
<li><p>Self care. Make sure that I am eating, sleeping, moving, drinking water, and the other things which I need to be the healthiest version of myself. This relates a lot to the top goal, but I guess here I’m saying physical self care rather than spiritual and mental.</p></li>
<li><p>Reading. I want to get through more of the backlog. Yesterday I went to a bar and read the last few chapters of the science book I’d been working through. In general set aside more blocks of time to simply disconnect, sit, and read a book. This will help inspire me, give the creative part of myself a rest, and help me to be better at knowing what all is known and thought.</p></li>
<li><p>Romance. Make efforts towards finding a life partner and generally try to be more open to more forms of love, not just the friendships I have and deeply treasure.<a href="#fn0431" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Looks great!</p>
<p>In making my list of general priorities, family was at the top, but it’s not an ideal here. Why? I generally feel like the way I am with my family is relatively good, and so it does not need to be an area of specific focus like these other five, where I feel that I am very lacking.</p>
<p>So: let’s revise our daily reflection template with my ordered tiers of goals in mind. Within each numbered entry, bulleted points are nominally of about the same importance, or at least feel flexible enough that I cannot always put one above another.</p>
<h1 id="daily-reflection">Daily Reflection</h1>
<ol>
<li><p>Top Priorities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sleep:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Keeping sleep time sacred?</p>
<p>Not at all last night, was on my computer until nearly 2300. Still, after that I did avoid using phone until this morning.</p></li>
<li><p>Good sleep hygiene?</p>
<p>Nope! As mentioned, on computer from 1900 until 2300, all in bed. That’s really bad.</p></li>
<li><p>Sleeping enough?</p>
<p>Eh, 8 hours is nominally enough. I tend to like having the option for up to 10, but that’s maybe not needed. I’ve been waking up with my alarm every morning lately, which is a sign that I maybe should be getting a little more.</p></li>
<li><p>How well rested do I feel?</p>
<p>Hard question to answer, because often sleep inertia, once overcome, really forgettable. I also have a lot of coffee<a href="#fn0432" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Then again, very little sleep inertia today, and I have generally been doing well at keeping energy through the day!</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Feed myself:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I eat breakfast?</p>
<p>Woo!</p></li>
<li><p>Did I eat a second meal?<a href="#fn0433" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>Nor entirely sure, but had a pastry which I’ll call breakfast and am actively working through a bowl of oats. Also packed a lunch, so we’ll see how that is.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I eat dinner?</p>
<p>Yesterday I did!</p></li>
<li><p>Water?</p>
<p>Drinking it right now. Want to empty the water bottle today, which shouldn’t be too hard, since I’m trapped in the bowels of the chemistry department.<a href="#fn0434" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Family:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Am I neglecting any familial obligations?</p>
<p>We’re doing a weekly asynchronous album walk, which I have yet to do. Since I’m going on a 21 mile walk this weekend, I imagine that I will have time for listening during it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Movement:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Am I stretching at least 5 minutes per hour of computer time?</p>
<p>So far today! I have stretched for each of the three hours I’ve been at work. Why five minutes, one might ask. The shortest period of time that my watch counts as a full workout is 5 minutes, so that’s the goal!</p></li>
<li><p>Am I generally making efforts to be limber?</p>
<p>Eh sort of.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Spirituality:</p>

<li><p>Guitar?</p>
<p>The piece for the wedding is so far based a lot around tenths, and I’m pretty sure the guitar book I’m nominally working through has exercises for that. Only one way to find out!<a href="#fn0440" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Other hobbies?</p>
<p>Tried a new ink yesterday and today!</p>
<p>Yesterday was Private Reserve Tanzanite. It’s a bluer purple than I’m used to really seeing. Looks really nice, especially as a formal ink. I don’t know how much formal hand writing I need to do, though.</p>
<p>It’s a very low shade,<a href="#fn0441" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref41"><sup>41</sup></a> non-sheen<a href="#fn0442" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref42"><sup>42</sup></a> ink which is probably why it feels formal.</p>
<p>Today is Diamine Spruce. It’s a nice deep green. Really saturated which I like, and decent amount of shading, going down almost to black at high saturation areas. At the lighter ends, seems nearish to Hex 006B34, though I can’t seem to figure out its exact coloring. No shimmer or sheen though.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Quaternary Goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Letter writing</p></li>
<li><p>Handwriting/penmanship</p>
<p>Practiced loops and lines with both hands!</p></li>
<li><p>Picking a new signature</p>
<p>Signed a check and so had a chance to test out an idea</p></li>

<h1 id="another-look-on-motivation"><a href="revisiting-motivation.html">Another Look On Motivation</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2025 April 26</p>
<h1 id="draft-4-26-april-2025">Draft 4: 26 April 2025</h1>
<p>Today I watched a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy53s5b3xkA">really interesting video</a> about many things, but especially the way we dehumanize children. As I then looked for a posting, something in me resonated with the idea of motivation. In the past three drafts, I’ve attempted to find how I feel<a href="#fn051" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, explore what that means<a href="#fn052" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, and frame the argument<a href="#fn053" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. Hopefully this fourth draft will be enough that I can lay down my metaphorical pen and experience life again.<a href="#fn054" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>When I first started thinking about autotelic motivation, I thought it was a nifty idea. I even reframed my daily reflections in that form: what do I want to do for itself and what do I want to do as a means to some other purpose. In doing so, I realize that I have accepted one of the great lies in our society: intrinsic motivation.</p>
<p>We glorify intrinsic motivation in modern society. If a child is honest and says that they are competing solely for a trophy, we scold them, saying that they should play for the love of the game. In a sense, I have been guilty of this. I decry schooling being thought of as job training rather than the end in itself.</p>
<p>However, every time that I have stopped to think about it, I realize that education is not an end in an of itself. Education lets you see the world more fully, allows you to express yourself, shows you the ways that you are within the web of humanity which reaches back to our first ancestors and into the infinite void of the future. Every action echoes into eternity.<a href="#fn055" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>By saying that an action is intrinsically motivated, we say that the goal of the action is its completion. Not only do we not consider what the action will effect on the world, we actively ignore the effects that our actions will have on those around us. Here I must confess that I come into this argument with a fundamental worldview that may not be true for others. I believe and try to know<a href="#fn056" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref6"><sup>6</sup></a> that every human life is infinitely valuable.</p>
<p>I mean this in a very literal sense: saying that an action is preferable to another because it will result in fewer deaths still assigns a value to human life. Infinity times 10 is still just infinity.</p>
<p>Maybe not as a consequence of this, but in a deep way connected to this, I also believe that we are all intrinsically bound to one another. I do not think of treating my sprained ankle as selfish, but I do occasionally worry that I only do the good I do because it makes me feel better. We are all sparks of the Divine, and we are all intimately connected to one another deeper than anything can or could ever sever. Try as society might, it cannot make us forget this fact forever.</p>
<p>Finally, I think that human life is uniquely priceless. Maybe this is a part of capitalism that I have yet to unlearn, but I am willing to say that many horrors can be inflicted on animals if it will save a human’s life.<a href="#fn057" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref7"><sup>7</sup></a> I don’t know how much I value a cow’s life, but I know that it is some finite amount. Anything finite divided by infinity is 0, so on some level anything that benefits any human is worth any amount of harm.</p>
<p>I am not a computer, though, and can see slippery slopes. Treating things as though they have no value inherently makes you place a value on humans. This is bad, so we should be careful with the world around us, etc etc.<a href="#fn058" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>When we treat a motivation as intrinsic, we explicitly say that the action it causes is an end. When I say that each human is an end, I mean that a human’s value is entirely in being a human. Intrinsic motivations, then, say that what we want to do is as valuable as the people around us.</p>
<p>We forget the web that holds us together: I may love the sound of song, but that does not mean that my neighbor does too.</p>
<p>We ignore the consequences our actions will have: I may love playing soccer, but my loss fundamentally means my opponents lose. If one of them was relying on the win for a scholarship, my actions negatively impact his life’s trajectory.</p>
<p>In short, we turn humans into tools.</p>
<p>While I think that this is probably too in the weeds to be a fight worth having with real people in real life, I do think that I will try to discourage intrinsic motivational speak. We should always have an idea of what our greatest goals are, and when we take conscious action, we must be able to connect them to that great work.</p>
<p>Judaism is incredible for this.</p>
<p>For a Christian, the fact that Judaism has effectively no theology about what happens after we die is almost unthinkable. For a Jew, the fact that Christianity’s theology is almost entirely about what happens after we die is what makes it a death cult. To a Christian, the good in helping our neighbor is that when we die Christ will see that we did. To a Jew, the good in helping our neighbor is that it makes the world more ready for the Messiah.</p>
<p>In both cases, the mission is to do good. In both cases, a faithful adherent leaves the world better than they entered. In the Christian case, however, the motivation is fundamentally selfish.</p>
<p>“We are all one body” is a common refrain in Catholic social teaching. That is, harming others ultimately harms ourselves, and helping others helps ourselves.</p>
<p>Believing that every human life is infinitely valuable can almost immediately become an excuse for hedonism and self-centering. After all, “I” am infinitely valuable, so why am I limiting myself in XYZ way?</p>
<p>If we shouldn’t value human lives relative to one another, then how do you deal with the fact that there legitimately is not and probably never will be enough medicine to treat all ailments? Any method of treating the ill fundamentally assigns one life as more valuable, because any medicine used is gone.</p>
<p>I have two gut reactions to this.</p>
<p>First, I will never deny that we live in an imperfect world. In a perfect world, would someone refuse medication, knowing that it could go to someone else? What if everyone did that?</p>
<p>I really don’t know.</p>
<p>What I do know, though, is that we could absolutely restructure society in a way that reduces the number of illnesses and ailments people face. We know that there are so many things which cause chronic issues, and yet we boil the oceans making better autocomplete generators. The issue is not, in most cases, truly a lack of supplies. The issue is that those with power do not, have not, and refuse to see other humans.</p>
<p>Second, there’s the Catholic teaching of double effect. Is it just word play to say that the reason we do something is what’s important, not necessarily the outcomes? Why is it ok to give a patient a lethal dose of morphine for pain but not to just do euthanasia?</p>
<p>I really don’t know how to justify double effect at this point. My mind is empty from realizing how much I try to exist independently of our world, and how radical a shift it would be for even a few people to embrace our net a little more. However, the principle of double effect is, fundamentally, what I think I’ve been getting at.</p>
<p>Intrinsic motivation tells us that the action is all that matters. Catholic teaching reminds us that actions have consequences, but that we can weight them. Personal moral discernment tells us how to weight what.</p>
<p>I think that I’ve still gotten a little lost here, but I find myself unchained from my muse. Maybe that means that the words here are sufficient, that they are enough. Are they an ending?</p>
<p>No, because this writing, like all else, sends its echoes into infinity.</p>
<p>I think this has changed my beliefs, we’ll see if it changes what I know.</p>
<h1 id="draft-3-26-april-2025">Draft 3: 26 April 2025</h1>
<p>N.B. In the past I’ve said that I’m going to try not framing my follies and instead simply leap into them. I’ve tried that in the past two drafts, and I think that there is absolutely merit in doing so, especially in early drafts. In this folly, though, I am actively attempting to make an argument, and I can only think of the argument in a narrative structure. With that in mind, please bear with me as I set the scene for my views on motivation.</p>
<p>A common idea is that society revolves around individuals giving up some sense of autonomy in order to produce a better overall social order. The strong man may not be able to have everything he wants, but he will not lose everything when someone invents the club. At its core, this idea sees humans as individuals first and community as a production of humanity.</p>
<p>Instead, I want to imagine society as humanity’s default state. After all, an infant child is completely helpless. A comment I like to make when picking up a wandering toddler or redirecting a small child is “sorry little one, there are limits to your autonomy.” In this way, I mirror the default state of society: as we grow, we gradually shed our dependencies on others and become an individual and atomized unit. That is, autonomy is something that we claim for ourselves, rather than where we begin.</p>
<p>I am far from the first to point out that society has atomized us more than ever before.</p>
<p>As with most things, though, the fruits of a tree are borne only after the tree has been nurtured. Our society would not be so atomized if we had not laid the bricks and walls which separated us.</p>
<p>I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again here: every action resounds into infinity. There are no final consequences, only intermediate effects. Even the word consequence shows society’s disconnect from this idea; it is intrinsically negative to believe that there is a connection between action and result. People will look at me strangely if I say that I was going to give my child consequences for their behavior, only to take them out to ice cream or otherwise reward them.</p>
<p>No, this framing is wrong. HMm.</p>
<h1 id="draft-2-26-april-2025">Draft 2: 26 April 2025</h1>
<p>N.B. I find that I’m much more willing to rewrite sentences in Draft 2. Just putting that out there so I remember if I ever go here again.</p>
<p>In my first post <a href="motivation">on motivation</a>, I was mostly complaining about the judgement I received for using extrinsic motivation as my primary source of reasoning. At the time, I felt like there was something unfulfilling in intrinsic motivation, but could not quite place my finger on what it was. With the wisdom of the past six years<a href="#fn059" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref9"><sup>9</sup></a>, I think that I have a few potential answers.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, I think that there is not just an issue with the way that society and socialization act to try to prioritize intrinsic motivation. The issue is not just with actions which are intrinsically motivated being seen as good. My issue is the world view which makes intrinsically motivated action possible to be seen as anything but evil.<a href="#fn0510" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Actions can only be their own ends in a worldview where we are a sole agent. If I do something only for how it will benefit me, then I fall into the deepest form of solipsism, not only ignoring the way that everything I do affects others, but actively trying to disconnect myself from the consequences of actions. Honestly, the fact that consequence is used almost exclusively as a pejorative is itself proof of this rot.</p>
<p>At my core, I truly believe<a href="#fn0511" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref11"><sup>11</sup></a> and attempt to know<a href="#fn0512" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref12"><sup>12</sup></a> that every other human is just as impossibly valuable as myself.<a href="#fn0513" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref13"><sup>13</sup></a> People are not means to whatever end I enact, people are themselves full ends in and of themselves. When I reduce someone to nothing more than the instrument of my will, I am killing them, in my own mind if not reality.<a href="#fn0514" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Actions, by contrast, are not alive. I’m not going to get into the deep dive of what I think an action is, because ultimately my goal today is very much not to play word games. Each human life is infinitely and incomparably valuable: priceless. Even by saying “this will kill X lives but save X+N”, you are assigning a price to the life. Infinity plus infinity is the same sized infinity.</p>
<p>Why am I going on so much about the value of humanity in a writing nominally about motivation?</p>
<p>Society today, modern capitalism more generally, the underpinnings of Protestantism<a href="#fn0515" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref15"><sup>15</sup></a> even more broadly, and even Christianity itself<a href="#fn0516" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref16"><sup>16</sup></a> to some extent fundamentally atomize the human experience. Going from widest to narrowest, the Church claims to teach that we are to see Christ in everyone, which is why we do good. And yet, that statement is based entirely on the Gospel passage where Christ says that when we die, we will be judged by how we treat those lesser than us. Christianity as a faith is fundamentally focused on death, and the death of the individual more than anything else. We cannot save any other soul, only our own, after all.</p>
<p>Protestantism takes this a step further. The Church emphasizes that all theology needs to be connected to those who came before, and that personal interpretation and experience matters far less than historic doctrine. Protestantism, by contrast, explicitly centers the personal and lived realities of its believers. Is there something far more empowering in the idea that you have your own independent relationship with the Divine?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Does that same empowerment also fundamentally divorce you from your fellow human?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Protestantism leads to Calvinism leads to prosperity gospel leads to modern capitalism. I do not know that it had to, but this is not a “for want of a horseshoe” story. It did, and we can see the effects of this everywhere we look.</p>
<p>In modern capitalism, a common critique is that everything has value entirely based on what monetary worth can be assigned to it. That is not actually entirely accurate though. After all, who assigns worth? What is money?</p>
<p>Again, I’m not trying to fall into wordplay.<a href="#fn0517" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>People will speak of “the market” or “consensus” as though either of these exist in actuality. There are not markets like there are humans. There is not consensus without humanity.</p>
<p>If everything has value only in monetary worth, then we must profane the sacred. We must say that there is a level of financial hardship past which it is better to let a child die. There are the countless stories of companies accepting that a number of people will die, knowing that the cost of a recall is greater than the expected value of payouts they will need to give to their grieving families. At a deeper level, though, it infects all discourse.</p>
<p>It is not worth pumping money into a child whose life expectancy measures in weeks, because those resources could be better spent elsewhere. There are a limited number of donor organs, so those who are less likely to abuse their bodies deserve what few there are more. We pump billions of dollars into machine learning, actively burning the earth and sea. People will argue against this, saying “it’s cheaper to just hire human labor.”</p>
<p>That is, everything in modern society is framed in costs and benefits. Society lionizes those who do whatever it takes to succeed. I alone matter.</p>
<p>In a sea of endless hordes, I alone have the spark of the Divine.</p>
<p>How does this relate to intrinsic motivation?<a href="#fn0518" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Intrinsic motivation tells us that our actions are their own end. I want to be clear, this is not me making an argument right now, this is just me stating what the term means. When we make actions an end, we make humans, the only true ends, means. This is my argument.</p>
<p>When I went to the wikipedia page for motivation, I was shown an image of two soccer players. One is thinking about all the things that winning the game might bring him, and the other is simply focused on the love of the sport. No one will support the first person, and rightly so. Personal glory is fundamentally a hollow and empty motivation.</p>
<p>The second, however, is doing something far more insidious.</p>
<p>“I want to win this so that the cute person will notice me” still gives the cute person a sense of agency. “I want to win this so that I get the trophy” assumes, on some level, that an external agent determines what it means to win and values that.</p>
<p>“I want to play because I enjoy soccer,” on the other hand, completely ignores everyone around. Soccer is a team sport; it requires coaches and referees, teammates and opponents, space and someone to maintain it, equipment and people to make it. Playing the sport for its own sake is saying, on a fundamental level, that every single one of those people and objects exists solely for your pleasure.</p>
<p>When I play a song for the beauty of the music of the moment, I ignore my connection to the rest of humanity. The neighbor who doesn’t want to hear my music pumping, the energy that my speakers use, the disconnect of listening to a song alone, rather than live with my family: all of these are consequences that intrinsic actions ignore.</p>
<p>Rereading these last two paragraphs, even I find myself bristling slightly. Just because an end is directed, doesn’t mean that there are no other considerations. However, I ask: what value does our enjoyment have?</p>
<p>I am not asking as an economist, who might find the exact dollar amount, pain you would endure, or harm you would be willing to inflict as a function of some arbitrary metric. I ask legitimately.</p>
<p>I said it at the beginning of this draft, and I will reiterate it here: every human life is infinitely precious and priceless.</p>
<p>Anything divided by infinity is 0. Any time that we assign value to something in a way that gives humans a value, we are explicitly saying that the humans are not priceless. The value of anything compared to a human life is nothing.</p>
<p>Here one might make a very fair point: we do not live in a vacuum. If I use all of my antibiotics on a chronically ill elderly man, then we will not have that medicine for the sick child. I agree, but even that framing belies the issue: we see ourselves as fundamentally separate.</p>
<p>Humans have a value intrinsic to our very nature. Humans also, though, exist as a social creature. In a very real sense, there is no “you” and “me”.</p>
<p>Many philosophical traditions find their way to this truth. The Church has the idea that “all sin is social sin because we are one body.” Hinduism has the belief in karma: all actions resound into infinity. Buddhism teaches that the idea of “I” as a distinct entity is fundamentally foolish.</p>
<p>Even common sense teaches us this, when we stop to think.</p>
<p>We would condemn someone who drove through a children’s soccer game because they wanted to get to the parking lot across the field. I’ve seen many argue that this is our willingness to give up some of our own autonomy in order to enact order. I’d argue it’s the opposite. We only claim autonomy, not have it on its own.</p>
<p>A baby is dependent, utterly and totally, on those around it. Is that a better way for me to frame the argument, maybe?</p>
<p>Start with “there is no autonomy”, then go to “every action is, by its very nature, consequential”, which brings us to “not considering consequences is choosing to dehumanize”? That seems reasonable, on to draft 3.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-26-april-2025">Draft 1: 26 April 2025</h1>
<p>One of the initial goals of this site was that, by having noted drafts with dates, I would be able to revisit old musings<a href="#fn0519" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref19"><sup>19</sup></a> and add new drafts as my life changed or my views did. I’m still not sure how I feel about that concept, though I think that at the very least, the reminder that most of the time what I post here is a raw and unedited first draft serves me well when I want to cringe at the writing I do.<a href="#fn0520" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Still, even if I was going to write new drafts of topics in the same url as the old, I don’t know if I would put this folly on top of <a href="motivation.html">the old one</a>. In that post, I focused<a href="#fn0521" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref21"><sup>21</sup></a> on my own internal versus external loci for motivation and why I thought that it was fine for me to have a mainly externalized locus of motivation. My goal today is somewhat different.</p>
<p>In one of the early posts of this iteration of the site<a href="#fn0522" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref22"><sup>22</sup></a>, I made comments about motivation. Why do we do things, and what not. I got really into the idea of autotelic motivation, doing things as their own ends.</p>
<p>And, in general, I find that I’m thinking more and more about the ways that we as a society really do treat everything as a means and nothing as an end. I don’t want that to be the case, and I’m finding myself aligning more and more with Catholic social morality<a href="#fn0523" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref23"><sup>23</sup></a>, which constantly rails against this treatment.</p>
<p>However, the Church does, in many ways, still direct our actions to have a purpose outside of themselves. There’s an image in C.S. Lewis’s “The Great Divorce” that struck me the first time I read it and every time since. An artist is being given the chance to enter heaven, he just needs to remember the fact that his art started as a way to glorify G-d and only then became about the love of the art itself. Every time I think about it, I find a deep part of me recoiling from this thought.</p>
<p>I think part of it might be the Jewish morality that I’ve inherited. While the Christian goal is to bring people to heaven, the Jewish social mission is to make the world as heaven Catholics try to get to the Messiah, which Jews try to make a world fit for a Messiah. And so, the beauty of color and how it interfaces with light is good in an of itself.</p>
<p>This is a number of words to say that I don’t really know how I feel about motivation. So much of what I do has the clear end that it is a means for. I play guitar so that I can be ready for a friend’s wedding. I do try to do kindnesses in order to align myself more with the Divine Will.</p>
<p>And yet, as a friend’s mother pointed out recently, there’s something inherently selfish in her motivation to make people smile. She feels better when the people around her are happy,<a href="#fn0524" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref24"><sup>24</sup></a> and so doing kindnesses benefits herself. Part of this disconnect has to do with the atomization of society, I more and more realize. When we see ourselves as independent agents, then helping someone else feels lessened if we benefit. If, instead, we see the web of interconnectedness and mutual obligation that we share with one another, then the benefit is in fact part of the help. I take antibiotics when I have infections, and I feed the hungry where they are.<a href="#fn0525" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>I’m wondering if this atomization idea can help me think about my own motivation. What does it mean to do something for its own sake?</p>
<p>I realize that I might just have a philosophical and epistemological framework which precludes autotelic motivation from being a thing. Platonists certainly wouldn’t believe in it, and while I don’t know how much I agree with the idea of a hidden realm of forms, I do still think that we can reflect deeper truths with shallow works.</p>
<p>Instrumental versus Intrinsic value was coined to describe a sociologist’s way of separating people’s reasons for doing good. To him,<a href="#fn0526" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref26"><sup>26</sup></a> and many thinkers after, intrinsic motivation is fundamentally ridiculous as a concept. Trying to divorce an action from its consequences is not just an effort in absurdism, it is itself wrong.</p>
<p>Why, then, do we spend so much energy as a society trying to convince especially our youth about the inherent superiority of judging actions as being their own ends?</p>
<p>This could quickly spiral into a diatribe about how capitalism as it exists now is fundamentally incapable of thinking about the future, and so everything’s value is its value at this exact moment. It could also spiral into a commentary on the fact that treating things as their own ends closes us off from one another, reducing anyone we are with to mere instruments. Soccer, a prime example of what we are told to enjoy for its own sake, requires teammates and opponents, referees and coaches. If I do it solely for enjoyment, then the value of those around me is solely in how they can help me reach my aims.</p>
<p>Is society really so transactional that it has taken me until now to realize the fact that intrinsic motivation is itself a form of viewing the rest of the world as means rather than ends?</p>
<p>More so, why do I take issues with actions being ends but not people?</p>
<p>Well, as soon as I write that, I see the difference. I do fundamentally believe in the inherent value of all human life. A person has value by virtue of nothing more than the word vir applying.<a href="#fn0527" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Actions, on the other hand, have value by how they affect the world around us.</p>
<p>Cool, let’s redraft this now that we know where we’re going.</p>
<h1 id="daily-notes">Daily Notes</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>Learn the songs for to jam</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Self:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Silence</p>
<p>Generally decently, I think. Then again, I have gotten most of the way through the month long backlog of videos that I had wanted to consume, so maybe not so much.</p></li>
<li><p>Typing practice.</p>
<p>There’s a tower defense game on Steam that is typing based, and I can definitely feel the way that all the typing I’ve been doing helped with there. Still, it’s not the same  level of intense focus as actually focusing on a single letter. It was, however, much more fun, and I found myself working on typing for an hour. With that in mind, I’m going to try one or two more.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep the phone out of the room for bed</p>
<p>Nope!</p></li>
<li><p>Pray St. Michael Chaplet in the morning</p>
<p>...</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch in the morning</p>
<p>Not really at all this week, which is not great, especially since I also haven’t really been stretching at night either.</p></li>
<li><p>Read at night</p>
<p>Not really, I read about half a book on Wednesday night, and then have been really tired upon bed time the past two nights.</p></li>
<li><p>Poetry at night</p>
<p>A few times! I feel like I need to systematize it again, because that’s the only way that I’ve ever been able to stick to a routine. I think a sonnet a day can once again be fun, because they do kind of just flow off after a while.</p></li>
<li><p>Clean the home</p>
<p>Spent a little over an hour this morning, and that was great, and my home is markedly cleaner as a result. It is still far from what I’d like, but I’m doing everything in my power to not let perfect become the enemy of good.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretching, standing, drinking water</p>
<p>Not a ton for stretching or standing. Not enough for drinking water, which I don’t love either. I have a water bottle sitting next to me, though, so this will help me to drink a little more.</p></li>
<li><p>Posture</p>
<p>I think generally decent. I still slouch far too much when sitting, but standing seems easier by the day. Of course, it is made leagues and fathoms<a href="#fn0528" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref28"><sup>28</sup></a> easier when I am stretching appropriately.</p></li>
<li><p>No wasted time</p>
<p>I generally think that I’m doing ok here. As I see more and more often, though, I need to remember that I cannot optimize my life fully. I spent about half of yesterday playing a game while getting through the youtube backlog<a href="#fn0529" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref29"><sup>29</sup></a>, but I was also feeling so worn down that it might not have been helpful to work harder.</p></li>
<li><p>Eat more than 2 meals a day</p>
<p>I think so? I have vague memories of eating food the past few days, even if that might be all that I have.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Goals and Growth:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ends:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Letter writing, get into more</p>
<p>Delivered the one letter, second one I don’t think has been received.</p>
<p>Also received a letter from a friend! That was really exciting.</p></li>
<li><p>Handwriting, pick and make the new one</p>
<p>Something about lower case letters in print really amplifies any imperfections in my writing, which I find really interesting.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Means:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Typing speed, improve it.</p>
<p>I will now go to do my five minutes of assigned typing to see what the speed is today. All letters were above 4 per second which is kind of wild to me. Now the goal is 4.5.</p>
<p>I think that once I get all of the letters above 5 characters per second<a href="#fn0530" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>Oh gosh, my top is only 90 words per minute, and my average is around 60. I don’t know why that feels horribly slow, except that I know so many people with over 100 wpm times. Then again, they tend to do them in more natural settings, where words flow from each other in some sensible manner. I’m happy with the progress, but going to keep it in CPS for the future.</p>
<p>Since they define one word as five characters<a href="#fn0531" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref31"><sup>31</sup></a>, only when all of my letters are at or above 60 wpm<a href="#fn0532" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref32"><sup>32</sup></a> will I start to worry about capitalization and punctuation.</p></li>
<li><p>Reading, do more of it</p>
<p>I got an ARC of a book that seems interesting, and have otherwise been trying to finish the audiobook I’m listening to.</p></li>
<li><p>Blogging, do it</p>
<p>Eh, haven’t been great about this, which is probably a sign, at least somewhat, of the fact that I have been nearing burnout. Then again, the fact that I’ve also been struggling to come up with my daily list of five things also could have told me that.</p></li>
<li><p>Writing things that are not the blog and thesis, do</p>
<p>I wrote the short story for my web novel for the week,<a href="#fn0533" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref33"><sup>33</sup></a> and it was generally well received.</p></li>
<li><p>Guitar, play it.</p>
<p>Not a ton, but I am at least strumming it most mornings and nights, which is still progress of a sort!</p></li>

<h1 id="on-fugue-and-flow-states"><a href="fugues-and-flow.html">On Fugue and Flow States</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2025 April 23</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today I’d like to explore the difference between fugue and flow. Flow states are apparently great, but a quick google search also tells me that ADHD and autism havers often have trouble differentiating flow from hyperfocus. I assume that I use fugue like they use hyperfocus, and even if neither explicit diagnosis applies to me, I think some of the experiences are shared.</p>
<p>One article seems to say that the difference is in intensity, where a flow state has you still aware of the outside world. However, the author then goes on to describe the difference in a cleaning example. The hyperfocused person will clean long past the normal level of cleanliness. It did have the great advice of only picking rest activities which are short term.<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>It seems also as though the site is opposed to hyperfocus because it is directed towards something unhelpful, like youtube. Apparently I should set break times and follow the mandatory breaks.</p>
<p>Oh cool! Next article then says that there’s academic research claiming that the difference is all in framing.</p>
<p>So, now that we’ve done our small literature review, let’s get on to what I think about them.</p>
<p>Flow is something that’s allegedly really desireable. My family immediately fell in love with the concept, which I think is only in part because the originator of the concept is a professor at my parents’ alma mater. In general, it seems like I’ve been running into the term more and more often in the years since the pandemic took over.<a href="#fn062" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Many are now writing and speaking about how one consequence of our low focus world is that we are less and less able to fall into flow states.</p>
<p>And so, it’s interesting to me that states of fugue, or hyperfocus, depending on the nomenclature one uses, are considered negative while flow states are positive. There’s tons of literature<a href="#fn063" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref3"><sup>3</sup></a> on flow, and it’s been the object of a lot of research. Fugue, on the other hand, has a number of meanings. Most often, it refers to a very intricate and rigid musical form. However, it can also be used to refer to a state where one forgets who and where they are and sets out wandering. Finally, we have the definition I tend to imply, which is an almost dreamlike state of consciousness.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>When I am in the midst of a dream, I cannot tell you the passage of linear time. What few clocks I remember are never in sync with the real world.<a href="#fn064" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref4"><sup>4</sup></a> When I start working on something, I also lose track of time.</p>
<p>In the peak of my fuguing, It was difficult for someone to get my attention. For better and worse, I am now distractable enough that I can be broken from the task at hand.</p>
<p>When is it for the better?</p>
<p>I have many obligations in life, and being called to them is good. Sometimes my body has needs that I’m ignoring, and being forced out of the state makes me aware of the fact. And, finally, sometimes the fugue is not helpful.</p>
<p>Many can relate to the experience of scrolling for hours, not out of any real interest, but simply because that’s what’s happening. In what feels similar, I can fall down the hole of fixing issues of issues of issues. As an example, I think that I spent forty minutes one day trying to figure out how to download an unlisted tex package. Why?</p>
<p>It had a way of formatting a specific equation that was unique to it. Why did I need that?</p>
<p>I was trying to copy a derivation from a paper. Why was I doing that?</p>
<p>I was trying to see if my project could leverage some other mathematical concepts. Why?</p>
<p>Honestly at this point we just get to the perfectionism inherent to me.</p>
<p>So, I guess the moral here is that I will call it flow when it serves me and fugue when it does not. I have to imagine that there’s a connection between the fugue state and musical form, because it does truly feel like I would need to be in one to write one. Who can say, though?</p>

<p>Spent a good few hours on it today! Woo.</p>
<p>Since my boss told me today that she would like to see something as soon as it’s ready, I do think that I should focus on a lower hanging fruit, so writing part of the thesis which doesn’t actively require me to do large swaths of derivations is probably best for me. Or, I suppose that equally valid would simply be not doing the derivations right now and having them come into a later draft.</p>
<p>Let’s stet that as the next writing goal: any time that there is something which requires me to pause for math, I skip it, until I have at least a solid and working set of text that I can add the math to later.<a href="#fn065" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Revise the thesis</p>
<p>Also somewhat! Realized that some of the things I do in my program are different now and so changed them to be more accurate. Also realized that I have some math that is not necessarily accurate, which I don’t so much love.</p></li>
<li><p>Edit the thesis</p></li>
<li><p>Research for the thesis</p>
<p>Woo! Spent a good few hours on this today, and made a presentation to give to the group on Friday, where I will hopefully be able to better highlight what things I do and do not know right now.</p></li>
<li><p>Read the books that might be useful for the thesis</p></li>
<li><p>Start citation tracking</p>
<p>Document continues to grow, I continue to not annotate it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Personal</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Learn the songs for to jam</p>
<p>Strummed my guitar for a few moments this morning. I really need to get back into things sooner than later.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Self:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Silence</p>
<p>I found the silence painful at points today, so good on me!</p></li>
<li><p>Typing practice.</p>
<p>Did some yesterday, will be doing more now.</p>
<p>Woo! Just got all of my letters above 3.5 characters per second, which means that now the goal is to get all of them above 4 per second. In time I will become a good typist. Unfortunately, the part of me which is opposed to cheating by just restarting lessons just lost me the one hundred and fifty seven lesson streak of over 95 percent accuracy.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep the phone out of the room for bed</p>
<p>I did that today! It was great, and I actually felt rested in the morning.</p></li>
<li><p>Pray St. Michael Chaplet in the morning</p>
<p>No, sadly.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch in the morning</p>
<p>I did this morning! It was great, and I felt better today for having done so.</p></li>
<li><p>Read at night</p>
<p>I did not yesterday, I don’t think? I don’t entirely recall, though.</p></li>
<li><p>Poetry at night</p>
<p>SHOOT! Tonight it will! I will remind myself.</p></li>
<li><p>Clean the home</p>
<p>Small steps forward yesterday and today!</p></li>
<li><p>Stretching, standing, drinking water</p>
<p>I got notified multiple times today that I had been stationary and sedentary for an entire hour, so clearly not. I also don’t think that I needed to refill my water bottle, which also suggests that I did not drink water appropriately.</p></li>
<li><p>Posture</p>
<p>Generally decent, though I did see myself in a window with incredibly slouched shoulders.</p></li>
<li><p>No wasted time</p>
<p>I think generally doing an ok job of this!</p></li>
<li><p>Eat more than 2 meals a day</p>
<p>I did that yesterday I think! After posting the post I ate more.</p>
<p>This day, however, I had breakfast? I think? Don’t entirely recall.</p>
<p>I did eat lunch, and was invited somewhere for dinner, and so had to eat. Tragically this means that I did miss my weekly Wednesday appointment, but it’s probably good for me.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Goals and Growth:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ends:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Letter writing, get into more</p>
<p>I wrote two letters yesterday! I posted one of them and forgot about the other.<a href="#fn066" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Handwriting, pick and make the new one</p>
<p>I still don’t entirely know how I feel about lower case letters, but wow.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Means:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Typing speed, improve it.</p>
<p>Finally broke 3.5 on everything!!</p></li>
<li><p>Reading, do more of it</p>
<p>I’ve been listening to the audiobook, and so will be moving on from that hopefully.</p></li>
<li><p>Blogging, do it</p>
<p>Look at this! Twoish for two! I’m going to post this one before night’s end, even if it does end up being half baked, because I hope that it will encourage me to do more returning to older posts.</p></li>
<li><p>Writing things that are not the blog and thesis, do</p>
<p>I don’t think that I’ve done really any of this! I guess the letters, and the morning journalling that I do also probably helps.</p></li>

<h1 id="shapenote-sacred-music-and-the-second-vatican-council"><a href="shapenote-sacred-music.html">Shapenote, Sacred Music, and the Second Vatican Council</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2025 April 22</p>
<h1 id="draft-2-22-april-2025">Draft 2: 22 April 2025</h1>
<p>One of my hotter liturgical takes is that we should not sing almost any hymns. The Church is clear that its preference is for, all else being equal, Gregorian chant over polyphony<a href="#fn071" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> over other Catholic music over the sacred music of the region. I note, at least, that nowhere in there is the singing of songs which are only ever Lutheran.</p>
<p>I’ve long been a believer that intent matters, especially in art. The fact that we sing hymns written by Martin Luther, who is uncontroversially not a Catholic in good standing, is always ridiculous to me. Even when the hymns aren’t being written by active apostates<a href="#fn072" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, they are still written, especially the older ones, by a group fundamentally opposed to the Church.</p>
<p>I’ve also, like the Church, long been a believer that ends do not justify means. We cannot effect an evil now in order to cause some future good. Hymnody is, at the very heart of its creation, evil.<a href="#fn073" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Many critique the Church for its art and beauty. Money spent on art, they argue, could be better spent on the needy. I agree with this take in some regards, though I do also absolutely agree with the argument that we should not have joyless existence. Also, much of the art being actively critiqued is old. The Church is not actively spending money on“at least much of. Preservation is its own thing, but I’m willing to say that preserving beauty is a worthwhile goal” the works, and selling them would only grant money once. More than that, though, the Church recognizes that when we see beauty, we are oriented towards Beauty. When we learn truth, we are oriented towards Truth. When we see light, we orient towards the Light of the World.</p>
<p>That is, having beautiful art, especially in the location where masses are held, is itself a way to help the congregation pray. Without getting into the debate about how literate the average person was in the age of Martin Luther, the church still taught that beauty is helpful, even and especially when it is hard to understand. Luther, among his many evils<a href="#fn074" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref4"><sup>4</sup></a>, introduced hymnody because he did not believe that peasants would understand the beauty of counterpoint. Instead, he took popular drinking songs and set them to sacred text.<a href="#fn075" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Polyphony, in his eyes, was to be reserved for the elites.</p>
<p>Returning to the title of this folly, though, it is not enough to simply argue against hymnody.<a href="#fn076" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref6"><sup>6</sup></a> After all, I do not also argue in favor of Gregorian chant and polyphony.<a href="#fn077" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Why should we sing shapenote?</p>
<p>The Church is clear in the Second Vatican Council that the musical traditions from outside the Latin Church, especially in mission areas, are to be encouraged. America is not and has never been a Catholic country.<a href="#fn078" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref8"><sup>8</sup></a> More than that, the Church is in crisis. We need to bring the lost sheep back into the fold, and bring the people who never had a home with Mother Church in.</p>
<p>The sacred musics of the United States are shapenote and spiritual/gospel.<a href="#fn079" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref9"><sup>9</sup></a> There are a number of considerations I have when advocating for music. Our country’s long history of oppression towards the Black population, especially<a href="#fn0710" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref10"><sup>10</sup></a> in regards to music, should not be ignored. I sing in primarily if not exclusively white choirs, and suggesting that we take the sacred music of a group that has been explicitly othered since before American was an identity feels complicated.<a href="#fn0711" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Shapenote, though, is not a wholly or even supermajority Black genre.</p>
<p>Shapenote singing from every level is designed to make it easy for the congregation to join in. Even outside of that, every shapenote song that are in hymnals are incredibly popular amongst the people. The goal is to get the congregation singing and to make the non-Catholic feel called home.</p>
<p>I do not know any choirs that sing Gregorian chant correctly, and I know few that do polyphony well.<a href="#fn0712" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref12"><sup>12</sup></a> All else is not equal.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-22-april-2025">Draft 1: 22 April 2025</h1>
<p>Something I think about a lot is music. Something else I think a lot about is the place of music in the liturgy. In <a href="what-we-dont-write">one of my recent attempts at a post</a><a href="#fn0713" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref13"><sup>13</sup></a>, I realized that song and prayer are intrinsically tied in my mind.</p>
<p>In thinking a little longer, I realize that there is also something almost contradictory in the way that I view music. On the one hand, I think that all music is, at least in part, a connection to the Divine. “The Lord of the Dance”, for all its apparent theological faults<a href="#fn0714" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref14"><sup>14</sup></a>, has always had a special place in my heart for that reason. From this general love of music, I think that it tracks that I hate the idea of banning any genre. I have friends whose parents would not let them listen to rock music growing up. It feels the same as any other form of censorship.<a href="#fn0715" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>In the document from the Second Vatican Council, <a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_instr_19670305_musicam-sacram_en.html">Musicam Sacram</a>, we hear the Church once again reaffirm its commitment to music and music in the liturgy. There have been any number of documents with at least some amount of Church authority behind them on how music should be performed in the Mass. I personally abhor Pope Saint Pius X’s <a href="https://www.papalencyclicals.net/pius10/tra-le-sollecitudini.htm">tra le sollecitudini</a><a href="#fn0716" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref16"><sup>16</sup></a>, which is generally pointed to as the first modern Church writing on music. However, as the schismatic group implies, Pope St. Pius X has a devoted fan club. Anyways, not to get into the argument I’m having more and more with the normal Catholic part of me<a href="#fn0717" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref17"><sup>17</sup></a> about so much of the things that we claim to be Church teachings actually being matters of rational inquiry, and therefore outside the purview of the Church, but I hate the disdain that practically drips from the document towards so called “popular music.”</p>
<p>Returning to Musicam Sacram, it is as far as I can tell, the last document from the Vatican that has the full weight of a Council behind it. There’s a question deep within me about the places where it disagrees with the Council of Trent on music, but this is also not the place for that. Throughout the document, it is very clear that the Church wants the congregation to sing. I’m just going to go through the easiest to skim ones to make a list before restarting.</p>
<p>From paragraph 4 we learn that any music composed for the liturgy is sacred, as well as any sacred popular music. Paragraph 5 reminds us that the liturgy is better when sung. Paragraph 7 gives the advice of what to pick when adding music: start with the most important, which is usually dialogue between the priest and the congregation.<a href="#fn0718" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Paragraph 8 has the general Catholic take of “if you have a choice, pick the best singer, especially if it’s being recorded”.<a href="#fn0719" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Paragraph 9 says that any sacred music can be acceptable in the Mass, and that the capabilities of the people must be taken into account.<a href="#fn0720" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>It cites <a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19631204_sacrosanctum-concilium_en.html">Sacrosantum Concilium p 116</a> which itself cites p60 of itself. In 116 we get the notorious “other things being equal, it (Gregorian chant) should be given pride of place in liturgical services.” Now, I have many feelings about Gregorian chant, and having gone to a Seder recently, they are only amplified. As far as any scholarly source I have seen claims, Gregorian chant is meant to be sung at the cadence we would read the words. I have never once been in a Catholic Mass where I heard chant done at that clip.</p>
<p>More than that, Gregorian chant is fundamentally not the music that people know. Paragraph 30 of SC<a href="#fn0721" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref21"><sup>21</sup></a> reminds us that the people should be encouraged to participate, especially through song. I’m going to quickly read through Chapter 6 of SC, since it also concerns sacred music.</p>
<p>Gotta love the opening, which says “The musical tradition of the universal Church is a treasure of inestimable value, greater even than that of any other art”<a href="#fn0722" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref22"><sup>22</sup></a>. It quickly reminds us that language choice is important, and I have many feelings about the people who say that the documents say more of the mass should still be in Latin. There is no effort to make the layperson understand Latin. From 114: “bishops and other pastors of souls must be at pains to ensure that, whenever the sacred action is to be celebrated with song, the whole body of the faithful may be able to contribute that active participation which is rightly theirs”. Composers are to be given special training, which I agree with, though don’t necessarily agree when it comes to the “especially boys” line. As far as I know, there are an equal number of Doctors of the Church who are men and women Only other notable things are the love of the pipe organ<a href="#fn0723" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref23"><sup>23</sup></a> and the fact that, especially in mission countries, we need to make special efforts to match our sacred music to the traditions of the people we speak to.</p>
<p>I’ve seen so much writing about how the world is post-Christian, and so can’t help but feel like we need to take from the sacred traditions where we are, to get the people back.</p>
<p>Back to MS.</p>
<p>P11 reminds us that ornate music is not always better. P16: “One cannot find anything more religious and more joyful in sacred celebrations than a whole congregation expressing its faith and devotion in song.” In particular, 16B: “Through suitable instruction and practices, the people should be gradually led to a fuller—indeed, to a complete—participation in those parts of the singing which pertain to them.” That is, we should be making the choirs and people able to sing along with everything. Choirs should not sing alone.</p>
<p>Part C feels like it walks that back a little, but.</p>
<p>We are reminded that sacred silence is also important.<a href="#fn0724" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>18 once again reminds us that the Church needs to start teaching people to sing from a young age. Far less than half of my Catholic friends sing in Mass, almost all of whom because they do not think they are good enough at singing. If true, it is a gross failing on the side of Mother Church.</p>
<p>20 reminds us again that, even when you have a killer choir, you still have to let people in.</p>
<p>I find it fun that any choral voicing is acceptable, even “if there is a genuine case for it, of women only”. I see references to boys but not girls, which is a little confusing to me.</p>
<p>Now we get to the really fun parts: the order that music should be added! More important than the Kyrie, Gloria, Agnus Dei, Creed, Alleluia, or Psalm is that the Our Father be sung. The Gospel acclimation, entrance and exit rites, and prayer after communion are all also in this first degree. I don’t know whether the enumerated items within each degree are sorted, but even if not, the Alleluia is in the third degree, among the least important of what is to be sung. It is in the same place as the standard places hymns go.</p>
<p>The people cannot be totally excluded from the Ordinary of the mass.<a href="#fn0725" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref25"><sup>25</sup></a> I feel like every choir director I know treats this as a “in general” not “in every case” kind of rule.<a href="#fn0726" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Oh interesting, we should be, when singing Gregorian chant, be singing the original settings, not random ones from people.</p>
<p>The line I have always found the most important: “Adapting sacred music for those regions which possess a musical tradition of their own, especially mission areas,[42] will require a very specialized preparation by the experts. It will be a question in fact of how to harmonize the sense of the sacred with the spirit, traditions and characteristic expressions proper to each of these peoples. Those who work in this field should have a sufficient knowledge both of the liturgy and musical tradition of the Church, and of the language, popular songs and other characteristic expressions of the people for whose benefit they are working.”<a href="#fn0727" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref27"><sup>27</sup></a> I do not think that America is generally considered a mission area, but we absolutely have a musical tradition outside of the Church. I’d argue America has two sacred music traditions unique to it: shapenote and gospel/spiritual.</p>
<p>Arguing that the primarily if not exclusively white choirs I sing in should sing more music which comes from Black oppression feels somewhat difficult, especially when remembering the way that so much of the popular music in America was actively stolen from Black composers and performers. However, shapenote singing lacks a lot of that cultural baggage. And, I’d argue just as importantly, every shapenote song in the hymnals I use is a song the congregation actively participates in. If the goal is to get the people to sing, we need to meet them where they are.</p>
<p>I find paragraph 63 fascinating. What does it mean for an instrument to only be appropriate for secular usage? Is not the great mission to go and make all Catholic?</p>
<p>67 reminds us that improv is cool and we should do it more.</p>
<p>Alrighty, let’s restart.</p>
<h1 id="daily-notes">Daily Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Obligations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Professional</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Write the thesis</p>
<p>Tragically little progress</p></li>
<li><p>Revise the thesis</p></li>
<li><p>Edit the thesis</p></li>
<li><p>Research for the thesis</p>
<p>Decent amount! Right now I have some computations running and I’m relatively hopeful that they will come out well. In retrospect, I probably don’t need to be using huge numbers of iterations right now when I’m really just trying to figure out if stuff works</p></li>
<li><p>Read the books that might be useful for the thesis</p></li>
<li><p>Start citation tracking</p>
<p>Working on it! For the paper I’m working on right now, I think that I have all the citations that I reference.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Personal</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Learn the songs for to jam</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Self:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Silence</p>
<p>Way too comfortable. I don’t like not wanting to listen to things.</p></li>
<li><p>Typing practice.</p>
<p>I’ve done literally none for a long time, and I don’t know if that is going to change. I guess it should, so let’s go ahead and throw five minutes on. It happened! I’m starting to get into a bad<a href="#fn0728" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref28"><sup>28</sup></a> habit of restarting lessons at the first mistake I make. While this does mean I get more practice on trouble words, it does also distort my writing accuracy. Looking at the two photos of my average typing speeds, it does really look like I’ve made progress, which is both really cool and kind of shocking, because it doesn’t really feel like I’ve gotten any better at this.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep the phone out of the room for bed</p>
<p>Not at all and WOW it needs to start living outside my room. I read a book for a few hours this morning<a href="#fn0729" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref29"><sup>29</sup></a> and that really screwed me up for the energy of the day.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch in the morning</p>
<p>Nope! Let’s get a little bit of this right now, at least like a front fold.</p></li>
<li><p>Read at night</p>
<p>I think so, the fun book, though, not any of the goal books. Still, reading is reading.</p></li>
<li><p>Poetry at night</p>
<p>Oh shoot I have completely spaced this.</p></li>
<li><p>Clean the home</p>
<p>I have fallen behind here, and that is a reflection on the way I am feeling.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretching, standing, drinking water</p>
<p>Eh, I suppose so, especially the water. Still not as much as I would like, but.</p></li>
<li><p>Posture</p>
<p>Nope! Wow I’ve been letting my shoulders slouch. Also wow I need to stretch my shoulders again, they are so tight.</p></li>
<li><p>No wasted time</p>
<p>I think so? I have been in the office until 9 pm every day this week, and that probably isn’t the healthiest choice. I also have to believe that my productivity is lower for those last hours, especially given what it looks like in the morning. For the rest of the week, what would it look like to leave work before 6pm every night? That would give us sufficient evening time to do things!</p>
<p>Overall, though, I’ve felt like I’m not getting enough rest breaks. It kind of feels like I have been going from activity to activity without having time to stop. I know that’s partially untrue, but an hour is truly an awkward amount of time when the two activities I have are both twenty minutes from home and less than four from each other.</p></li>
<li><p>Eat more than 2 meals a day</p>
<p>I have a very firm memory of doing really well at this yesterday! Today, I had a bagel for breakfast, and some carrots for lunch.<a href="#fn0730" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref30"><sup>30</sup></a> I’m planning to go grocery shopping tonight, though, so that should be a good place to get some more calories in.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Goals and Growth:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ends:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Letter writing, get into more</p>
<p>I’m going to give myself some grace here, because it was literally Easter on Sunday. Tomorrow, I think that I might try to avoid the office for the morning and just work in a few different locations. If that makes me more productive, great! I know to avoid the office. If not, also great, and then I know that those locations are not winners for me.</p>
<p>All this to say, tomorrow I’m planning on spending some time in my cage, and I think that it could be nice to write another letter or two. Probably just one, but I would also like to read the etiquette books to know what goes in them. Looking at the website for one of the guides<a href="#fn0731" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref31"><sup>31</sup></a>, it seems like generally one is just supposed to know what to put in a letter? Eh, I’ll try something out and see how it goes.</p></li>
<li><p>Handwriting, pick and make the new one</p>
<p>I’m enjoying working with lower case letters again! I do still kind of feel like I don’t have enough control to make each letter look identical and be spaced the same, and I do catch myself often going into cursive for a few letters or back to all capitals on a difficult word.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Means:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Typing speed, improve it.</p>
<p>I like having this in two places because it means that I get two chances to remind myself. I don’t think that I want to spend another five minutes practicing, but I do have some typing games that could be fun when I finish with work.</p></li>
<li><p>Reading, do more of it</p>
<p>I finished the series I was reading. I forgot how it just never gets brighter.</p></li>
<li><p>Blogging, do it.</p>
<p>Well, in my defense, there has been a lot going on.</p></li>
<li><p>Writing things that are not the blog and thesis, do</p>
<p>I’ve been doing ok about keeping a hand written journal equivalent these past few days. Not entirely sure if it’s the best use of my time but I enjoy it and I think that any time I spend on trying to figure myself and my priorities out is generally time well spent.</p></li>

<h1 id="on-succeeding-at-creating"><a href="succeeding-at-creating.html">On Succeeding at Creating</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2025 April 17</p>
<h1 id="draft-2-17-april-2025">Draft 2: 17 April 2025</h1>
<p>In a wondrous display of kismet, for my break I started reading what I had thought was one of the very easy books of science I had checked out. Instead, it was<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> a collection of essays from top scientists and mathematicians writing against reductionism. I’m struggling to articulate exactly what about that helped me with the sense of creating, but I think that I will do better here.</p>
<p>Science is, depending on the activity, a creative endeavor. There is minimal creativity involved in measuring a molecule, sure, but the knowledge that gives means that new questions can be asked. And, of course, measuring may not be so simple.</p>
<p>Einstein famously derided the parts of his relativity that suggested the existence of black holes.<a href="#fn082" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> It is now seen as one of the greater proofs of general relativity. Without getting into the quagmire I have with regards to knowledge, teaching, and revelation, I think that there is something to be said for the fact that we are terrible judges of ourselves.</p>
<p>Having written that line, I now realize that it sums up my feelings on succeeding at creating. I cannot know how something I craft will change the world, both because the future is unknowable and also because I am too close to it. Einstein saw errors when his math showed black holes; I know that there are other instances, but again, my mind runs dry.</p>
<p>So, I guess that what I should consider when judging the success or failure of anything I create is less whether the audience I intended is receptive to it, and more whether what I created can inspire something new. General relativity is a successful creation not in spite of its unexpected consequences, but in fact because of it. If what I make causes no new questions, leads to no new joy or inspiration, then it is a failure.</p>
<p>I think that is an answer I can accept. To succeed at creation is to create something which catalyzes another creation.</p>
<p>Catalysts are themselves something interesting that I should consider talking about at another time. They seem so strange, because they neither destabilize the starting material nor stabilize the product, nor even provide energy directly to a reaction. Instead, they simply make the changes easier to occur. Where does the effort to change go?<a href="#fn083" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>If life is a chemical system, then the energy needed to overcome inertia and move to an easier path should go somewhere itself. To succeed at creating something, somehow that must make creation easier in a general sense. If ideas are in the ether, a plane separate from our own, is each act of creation a cracking of the window separating the two?</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-17-april-2025">Draft 1: 17 April 2025</h1>
<p>The goal of today’s folly is to figure out what, exactly, it means to me to be successful at a creative endeavor. A better question might be why I think that it’s important to succeed, but I don’t really think so. After all, success just means accomplishing goals. There should be a goal behind the act of creation, at least in my mind. Now that I’m ok with the fact that I’m going to be thinking of creation as an endeavor one can succeed or fail at, let’s think about what that means.</p>
<p>In this society, success is incredibly easy to define: fame. Some might argue for wealth, and I wouldn’t fight them on that point<a href="#fn084" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref4"><sup>4</sup></a>, but it would not be my personal truth. So, should I judge the success of something I create based on how famous it makes me, or at the very least how much it improves my bank account?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>That’s an easy enough answer. I don’t want my life to be commodified. The harder question is whether or not I do judge success from that metric.</p>
<p>There is also the question of the professional creative. If my income comes<a href="#fn085" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref5"><sup>5</sup></a> from painting, then the world’s willingness to pay for a painting is a metric of its success. Of course, that then means that we run into the locus of control issue. It’s a famous and well known truth that very few artists are appreciated in their time. I don’t think that it’s reasonable to say that a work suddenly became successful hundreds of years after its makers death because someone decided to spend lifetimes of an average worker’s income on it.</p>
<p>I guess what I’m trying to play with here is the idea of intent. That is, is success defined as how well you accomplished what you set out to accomplish?</p>
<p>What if you have multiple goals? What if you didn’t think about what every goal was at the beginning of the project? What if your goals change?</p>
<p>So, if I don’t think that we should judge success from external metrics and doubt our ability to judge it fairly from internal ones, where does that leave us? I’m not entirely sure. In the initial formulation for this folly, I was thinking about audience reception, how well your message was conveyed to the audience, and stuff of that nature. However, even just a little work in thinking shows me how all metrics fall short.</p>
<p>What are some ways that I could look at a work and judge it a success? Finishing something is a form of success all its own. Then again, what does it mean to finish a project?</p>
<p>If I make something for someone and they like it, is it a success? If they don’t like anything on the day I gave it to them, but on a normal day they would, is that a success? If I make something perfectly according to a template but the receiver hates the template, would that be a success?</p>
<p>I don’t know if my mind is working slower than normal, but I cannot seem to come up with answers, only more questions. Perhaps it is something of a self fulfilling prophecy: I said that this site was full of follies and now find myself unable to say anything of meaning.</p>
<p>In specific terms, did I succeed with this post?</p>
<p>I wrote it, which is one of my goals, and it will be finished soon, which is a form of success. I explored how I felt, even if only lightly. I tried to connect my new thoughts to my future actions, and I think that I did a decent job there.</p>
<p>Is there perhaps just minimal utility to judging success of an endeavor? Nearly everything I have done which felt judged or as a success thing was inherently comparative. Comparison does nothing to the work except harm it.<a href="#fn086" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>A professor emeritus told me that the goal of every conversation should be setting up the possibility of a future conversation. So, is the success of a creative endeavor in how much it orients you to continue creating? We are not lone figures, though; is the success of creation how much it net orients the world to that craft? No exercise exists in isolation; is success how much it orients the world to creation?</p>
<p>What does it even mean to create?</p>
<p>I cannot enact any cause without the sum of the forces which have acted on me, regardless of how indirect. I cannot create any new energy,<a href="#fn087" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref7"><sup>7</sup></a> so is everything I do just rearranging? When I make music, it dies away seconds after I finish. What does it mean to create something so ephemeral?</p>
<p>Ozymandus reminds us that in the eyes of even just the human race, anything about us becomes ephemera.</p>
<p>Let’s see if we can’t reign this energy in. I don’t know about another draft, but at the very least I want to see what stepping away for a bit does for me. I think that it helps me to take time away from writing, and I have another hour before my scheduled time comes to an end.</p>

<p>Day two of hand journaling as a way to use up ink went well! I am really finding that forcing myself to use a fude tip does really quickly actually make writing with it enjoyable.

<p>Right after notes here!</p>
<p>I want to work on getting more accuracy right now, I think. The issue with that is that I don’t really have a great idea how to only type correctly in a way that also improves my typing speed.

<li><p>Reading, do more of it</p>
<p>Yes! I am really enjoying this book series, and I think that I might have just forgotten to enjoy reading recently.</p></li>

<h1 id="on-what-i-call-this-writing"><a href="verbiage.html">On What I Call This Writing</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2025 April 16</p>
<h1 id="draft-2-16-april-2025">Draft 2: 16 April 2025</h1>
<p>Immediately after posting the first draft, one of my readers brainstormed some ideas with me, so I’m going to run through all of them and say what I think of them.</p>
<p>Explorations. I don’t really love this one, because I don’t think of this site as being focused around discovery, which I consider a large part of exploration. It also has a weird feeling associated when I think of describing it to others. Sadly, I think reflections has this one beat.</p>
<p>Expressions. I like expressions as a word, and there is the whole fun bit about like genes get expressed, emotions get expressed, etc. that I’m having trouble connecting to right now. In terms of relating it to these writings, though, I think that it feels a little off. I think that I want to think of this as a form of expression, rather than expression itself.<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Impressions. I do so much love the inner outer divide. There could be something fun about having impressions and expressions as the concept for what I write, because it does point out that I, rightly, am not just responding to material (impression) but that the response itself motivates action (expression). However, “want to read my expressions and impressions” feels wrong, and more importantly, ordering them would cause me so much pain.</p>
<p>Screaming into the void. I think that I’ve made comments here about my writing going into the void when I felt like no one read. There’s something kind of fun about asking someone if they’ve read my screams.<a href="#fn092" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> However, reading screams parses badly to me.</p>
<p>Sending into the ether. In the post I’m still working on, I talk about the ether in what I understand to be a premodern sense. Since I haven’t finished it yet, though, I don’t think that it would be good for me to attach the label just yet.</p>
<p>Messages. A message is a unit of information, which most of the dictionaries describe as short. While that may have been historically accurate to me, these writings<a href="#fn093" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref3"><sup>3</sup></a> are consistently getting into the multiple thousand words. That is, over the course of a month, I am approaching the length of a full novel.<a href="#fn094" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref4"><sup>4</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#fn095" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref5"><sup>5</sup></a> I have trouble calling 4 percent of a novel a short unit of information. I am also not going to address whether there is, in fact, information in these digital pages.</p>
<p>Page is an interesting option.<a href="#fn096" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref6"><sup>6</sup></a> I like that it refers to both a leaf in a book as well as an errandboy. Then again, I don’t know quite what that means, and so will move on from it as well.</p>
<p>Scripts.<a href="#fn097" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref7"><sup>7</sup></a> There’s the joke that the greatest perk of a Ph.D. is that any time a package arrives, you get to say “ah, just what the doctor ordered.” Scripts also imply, at least to me, the exact font or hand that people write in. It’s long been known and believed<a href="#fn098" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref8"><sup>8</sup></a> that handwriting is informative. I also cannot help but feel like the tone of my writing says things about me.<a href="#fn099" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Scripts also have the connection to actors, and in general have some sort of a prescriptive<a href="#fn0910" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref10"><sup>10</sup></a> element to them. I fear and love the idea that what exists here effects change on the world.</p>
<p>Scripts lack a little bit of immediate ease in understanding, though. While musings and essays and even reflections seem like something I could say to a stranger and expect them to parse my meaning, I have to imagine that if someone heard I wrote a script a day that I was either a really slow pharmacist or an incredibly prolific stagewriter. Still, all words only get meaning in as much as they are used, and so scripts are definitely up there.</p>
<p>On a similar note, manuscript.<a href="#fn0911" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Manuscripts, as the breakdown of its parts might imply, are generally implied to be hand written. However, there is an argument to be made for this work as not being printed, and therefor<a href="#fn0912" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref12"><sup>12</sup></a> belonging as one, along with the idea that the original version is a manuscript. This site is certainly the original version of most of these thoughts in my mind, though the fact that there are drafts might make that untrue in some valid and fundamental sense. After all, a draft is, by its very meaning, derivative.<a href="#fn0913" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Opus and opera.<a href="#fn0914" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref14"><sup>14</sup></a> I mean these are, by most definitions, works. However, I think that, again, people might misunderstand when they say I add to my opera daily. I also really hate that we call musical pieces by work and then number, even if I can’t quite justify why. I think that it has something to do with the fact that they’re both functionally just numbering schemes, and there doesn’t seem to be consistent which is the super and sub heading.</p>
<p>Works<a href="#fn0915" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref15"><sup>15</sup></a>. I do kind of love this. “look at what I have wrought”, I might say.<a href="#fn0916" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref16"><sup>16</sup></a> However, this is not really labor, in most senses of the word. I receive no compensation, and I do not struggle to do this.<a href="#fn0917" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref17"><sup>17</sup></a> It also feels intellectually dishonest, because I do still associate work with labor with physical exertion. That’s something to consider.</p>
<p>Labors<a href="#fn0918" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref18"><sup>18</sup></a>. I love this, because writings are often described as children, the output of labor in the childrearing sense is a child, and it hearkens to epic times. However, laborious is what we turn the word into, and I don’t really love that, because I want this writing to remain fun. Labors of love are, after all, labors.</p>
<p>Folios.<a href="#fn0919" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Folio can mean a few interrelated things, which is great, because what’s one more. It does generally imply that the document is folded, though, and there aren’t any folds in digital scrolling. It also comes from the Latin for leaf, and I do like thinking of my writing as life-oriented, just like leaves. I think this might be the current winner, because it’s also a fun word to say.</p>
<p>Paper.<a href="#fn0920" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref20"><sup>20</sup></a> White papers are a common way to quickly represent information, often in an informal context. In general, I think that no one really has issues abstracting papers into something digital, though I feel like most still imply some sort of pagination in a printer friendly way. It also feels somewhat confusing to the eavesdropper, since I exist near academia. Still, another close one.</p>
<p>Illuminations.<a href="#fn0921" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Wow I’m really digging deep into book lore. I would like to think that my writings shine light on something, but it feels pretentious to assume that they would. In an ideal world, I would be writing illuminations, but that does not mean I would refer to them as such.</p>
<p>Incunable or cradle. The first refers to early printings in England, and the second is the English of the term. Honestly, I do kind of like calling this a cradle. This is a place for new ideas to be birthed, or at least cared for. What does that make each writing, though? Or, is each writing a cradle, and the overall effect is the nursery? I don’t know if I like cradle, because it feels too abstract. Incunable is fun, though, and does refer to the fact that<a href="#fn0922" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref22"><sup>22</sup></a> these writings are the beginnings of my career. It’s a little difficult for me to say and spell though.</p>
<p>Type. Eh, doesn’t resonate. Moving on.</p>
<p>Parchment. I do love the idea of taking a word which has a very specific (if often misused) meaning and using it intentionally in a different context. Also, I do kind of love the visceral nature of parchment. Something about turning an animal into the substrate for ideas resonates within a deep part of me. Parchment is winning out for now, I guess.</p>
<p>Vellum is indistinguishable from parchment, and so modern scholars use the term membrane. Ooh membrane is almost better. It points out that there is an inherent barrier, both between my mind and the keys, but also between the words and the reader. Still, both are again a little too obscure.<a href="#fn0923" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Returning to the actual list, we have letters. This makes me think of the biblical<a href="#fn0924" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref24"><sup>24</sup></a> books, which are at least somewhat public facing, and generally directed towards an explicit end. That’s true here. Letters are winning.</p>
<p>Characters is where my mind went from letters, since I do find it strange that we have a word which refers to both the individual glyph and the string of them together. Character, number, and glyph, however, are all a little too far from common usage for my tastes.</p>
<p>Writing glyphs just now made me think of the word arcana, and its singular arcanum.<a href="#fn0925" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref25"><sup>25</sup></a> I would argue that this is specialized, and accessible only to a select few. I do like “I’m working on my arcane website”, and I like thinking of the writings as self contained.</p>
<p>Arcana brings me to esoterica and eldritch.<a href="#fn0926" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Esoterica is a great word, and generally refers to the impractical or at least obscure. Obscura, though, implies some level of intentional obscurement. Eldritch originally comes from elf, and is therefore bad. Esoterica is a fun winner right now, though there isn’t a singular form of the word, I don’t think? I am ok referring to my work each day as an esoteric, though.</p>
<p>From esoteric, one can easily move to follies.<a href="#fn0927" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref27"><sup>27</sup></a> I feel like I remember watching a show called follies as a child, and I have to assume it was looney tunes, giving an inverse Nimrod effect.<a href="#fn0928" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref28"><sup>28</sup></a> It feels a little self denigrating to refer to these works as foolish, though it isn’t necessarily inaccurate. Time spent here, after all, is time not spent elsewhere.</p>
<p>Email. Eh, it’s accurate but.</p>
<p>Moving to the more abstract, I have yarns, spilled ink, thread, and stitch. Spilled ink is a fun one, but might be better as the title for the blog than a specific post. It feels strange at a deep level to message someone “what’d you think of my latest spilled ink?”</p>
<p>Rants or Ragings both imply more anger than I want to bring.</p>
<p>Echoes could be fun, but feel too abstract.</p>
<p>My mind, like the well it is, has run dry now, and so I present a list of the remaining options so one might peruse at their leisure.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Broadsides. Because like the old printing</p></li>
<li><p>Impulse driver. Because I’m causing things, and science</p></li>
<li><p>Waveform. Because, like a reflection, has a specific shape</p></li>
<li><p>Wave generator. General idea of make waves.</p></li>

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>I don’t know what to refer to these writings as.</p>
<p>The obvious answer is to call it a blog, but since blog comes from web log, meaning a log on the internet, I’m not sure that it’s the best term. After all, these posts are, at least hopefully, less a factual recounting of elapsed time and more a series of explorations into ideas.</p>
<p>My father, who I copy so much of this site from, calls his writings musings. Trawling through his site, I eventually saw that, as I see in the early posts, he initially called the posts essays. A commenter pointed out that not all of his posts are, technically speaking, essays.<a href="#fn0929" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Since he frequently refers to his muse in the writings, calling the writings musings became a next step. As far as I can tell, that’s the extent of his reasoning.<a href="#fn0930" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref30"><sup>30</sup></a> To muse is to contemplate or think deeply, and so there’s something to be said for the idea that, if I am thinking deeply, then I am musing.</p>
<p>Essay, being his initial title, is another way to refer to what I’m writing. This has the benefit of sounding a lot more pretentious<a href="#fn0931" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref31"><sup>31</sup></a>. It comes from the French for “to attempt”, and initially were<a href="#fn0932" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref32"><sup>32</sup></a> used as a way to “attempt” to put thoughts into writing.<a href="#fn0933" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref33"><sup>33</sup></a> I don’t really know if this is so much about me attempting to put thoughts into writing as it is developing thoughts through writing, but it’s still something to consider.</p>
<p>Post is another easy option, since it’s sort of the default thing that most social media<a href="#fn0934" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref34"><sup>34</sup></a> uses. It, as far as I can guess and tell from three seconds of research, refers to the fact that when you wanted to distribute information broadly,<a href="#fn0935" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref35"><sup>35</sup></a> you could affix writing to a physical post. I don’t love it, and I think that most of it is just that I don’t like the way that the word feels in my mouth. It’s also vague and not impressive sounding, so that doesn’t help its case.</p>
<p>Experiments could be a fun name, especially since I am a scientist. I’m experimenting to figure out answers, even if I’m not using the classical scientific method. That just feels overly pretentious though.</p>
<p>Attempts?</p>
<p>Let’s see how that feels, “in today’s attempt, I want to think about how I feel about”. I don’t hate it, but I don’t love it enough to be comfortable forcing those in my life to accept it as part of my idiolect.<a href="#fn0936" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>Interestingly, it appears that the Latin word for “to try”<a href="#fn0937" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref37"><sup>37</sup></a> comes from the word for either stretching or having. I’m going to guess it’s the grasping one. So, how do I feel about words like grasp or containing? Eh.</p>
<p>If we return to musing, we get contemplations and reflections. My word processor doesn’t like making contemplation plural, so reflections is probably good. There’s an argument to be made that I am not reflecting, I’m emitting,<a href="#fn0938" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref38"><sup>38</sup></a> since the information almost always basically goes out, rather than going in both directions. Still, it is about looking for the after effects of thoughts that I’ve had and encountered. In that regard, ripples could be good.<a href="#fn0939" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref39"><sup>39</sup></a> I’m reading a book right now which says fields are just a consequence of information having a limited speed. I don’t know how that relates here, though.</p>
<p>I think that I’m happiest with reflections for now, even as I solicit more feedback.</p>
<p>Post Script:</p>
<p>Unlike my father, I do not feel the need to dedicate part of the naming to rants, because few enough of my writings are based in anger</p>
<h1 id="daily-notes">Daily Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Obligations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Professional</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Write the thesis</p>
<p>Realized I’ve been really slacking on this, and so made some efforts to try to figure out how it might be better for me if I set up my schedule differently. Unfortunately, it does more and more seem like I can only use each system for a few days or weeks before it stops working for me. I guess that I have also only today woken up early enough to do my ideal morning routine, so that might also have something to do with it.</p></li>
<li><p>Revise the thesis</p></li>
<li><p>Edit the thesis</p></li>
<li><p>Research for the thesis</p>
<p>It took me until I was lying<a href="#fn0940" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref40"><sup>40</sup></a> in bed last night to realize one of the very silly mistakes I’ve been making. I have a bunch of systems of equations which interrelate variables. I’d been solving them by hand.</p>
<p>As it turns out, and as I had literally used during an early version of this project, Python has a package which will solve symbolic systems of equations. When fully reduced, it turns out that I was not doing the best of jobs in terms of algebra.<a href="#fn0941" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Then again, given the fact that the numbers are very small, it’s entirely possible that I’m just hitting up against the floating point limits at times.<a href="#fn0942" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref42"><sup>42</sup></a> So, I’m now spending the much shorter amount of time that it takes to resolve the different numbers in terms of each other.</p></li>
<li><p>Read the books that might be useful for the thesis</p>
<p>One of these days I’ll get better about this. That day, however, is not today.</p></li>
<li><p>Start citation tracking</p>
<p>I’m at least citing within my notes, though that does mean that I’ll have to page through the book, reading through the only partially coherent ramblings of a madman.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Personal</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Learn the songs for to jam</p>
<p>Really need to get on this one, especially since I also really need to learn and write some guitar music.</p>
<p>I do also have a wedding coming up early 2026<a href="#fn0943" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref43"><sup>43</sup></a> that I have a commission for, so should look at this.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Self:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Silence</p>
<p>Doing really well at this one, but I don’t know if it’s silence in a good way, if that makes any sense at all.</p></li>
<li><p>Typing practice.</p>
<p>Shoot! Anyways, I’m unsure if I’ll get to it today, since wow the time flies.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep the phone out of the room for bed</p>
<p>Nope! But I did generally find that it wasn’t too horrible in the morning, and I set it down without much of an issue at all, so the end goal was still accomplished.</p></li>
<li><p>Pray St. Michael Chaplet in the morning</p>
<p>I did! It went well, and I think helped me set myself up for success.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch in the morning</p>
<p>I did! Wild that I can almost touch my palms to the ground, and equally wild that the same parts of me continue to feel the tightest.</p></li>
<li><p>Read at night</p></li>
<li><p>Poetry at night</p></li>
<li><p>Clean the home</p>
<p>Woo!</p></li>
<li><p>Stretching, standing, drinking water</p>
<p>Nope! OOf I am perpetually dehydrated right now. That’s a good goal for today: get through the water bottle.</p></li>
<li><p>Posture</p>
<p>Decently, again, I continue to catch myself more and more frequently. The shoulders do have a tendency to slump in, but I also don’t want to go too far in the opposite direction. Unfortunately, most advice about posture assumes it’s the spine that’s the issue, not the shoulders, so I’m not sure which part of the shoulder should touch the wall.</p></li>
<li><p>No wasted time</p>
<p>Only existentially! I did not, as it turns out, need to solve for the different commutation relationships that were derived in the paper. I’m glad that I did, just because it means that I can trust parts of my code more, but.</p></li>
<li><p>Eat more than 2 meals a day</p>
<p>I think so! I ate oats for breakfast, an apple, and curry rice! Woo, go me.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Goals and Growth:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ends:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Letter writing, get into more</p>
<p>Playing with inks has been nice.</p></li>
<li><p>Handwriting, pick and make the new one</p>
<p>I’ve decided that, since some amount of ink stays in the nib<a href="#fn0944" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref44"><sup>44</sup></a> when I empty it, journaling in an analog sense could be useful each morning</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Means:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Typing speed, improve it.</p></li>
<li><p>Reading, do more of it</p></li>
<li><p>Blogging, do it</p>
<p>Woo!</p></li>
<li><p>Writing things that are not the blog and thesis, do</p>
<p>Journal in the morning!</p></li>
</ul></li>
