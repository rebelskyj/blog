<h1 id="reflections-on-todays-gospel"><a href="reflections-on-readings-32-ordinary-a-23.html">Reflections on Today‚Äôs Gospel</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 November 12</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>In the first draft of this post,<a href="#fn001" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I thought a lot about what the Gospel message was, and then remembered that other, better read, and smarter people than I have asked the same question before. So, after I reflected on the readings, I read through some reflections from Doctors of the Church and other Saints. In this draft, I think I‚Äôd like to go through the three readings in order, because that feels like a better way to construct the narrative.</p>
<p>We begin with the First Reading.<a href="#fn002" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> The reading today comes from Wisdom<a href="#fn003" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, and more or less exhorts the reader to seek wisdom. In reading commentaries, I was reminded of how much of the faith has been so effectively handed down through the centuries. These days, it feels obvious to say that seeking wisdom means seeking the Holy Spirit, but that was not always a settled question.<a href="#fn004" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The Second Reading is also pretty straightforward. St. Paul explains that we should mourn with the hope and knowledge that those we love are asleep in Christ, ready to be raised up on the last day.</p>
<p>With both of those readings priming us, we are taken to the Gospel. The Gospel passage today concerns the parable of the ten virgins waiting for the bridegroom. As you might expect, there are a number of interpretations of nearly every part of the reading, and what, exactly, they symbolize. What is not in contention, though, is the meaning of lamps and oils.</p>
<p>Lamps represent a belief in the Almighty, and the oil represents the good works we do. Works without faith are meaningless, as oil without a lamp is fairly useless. St. Augustine points out that, at some point, we are unable to create oil ourselves. That is, while we can press olives to make oil, we cannot cause an olive to grow. In such a way, any good we do is only through He who is Goodness itself. But, just like a lamp without oil cannot shine, so to is faith without works dead. It‚Äôs interesting to me how clearly that was seen in the Early Church, given the controversies that arose a few centuries later.</p>
<p>The fact that all ten virgins fell asleep is seen as a euphemism for the fact that all die. When the bridegroom, Christ, returns, not all will be ready. Rather than explicitly punishing, as he does in other parables, though, he simply ignores the faithless.</p>
<p>Two parts of the Gospel that I did not immediately think of as speaking to any truths were the fact that there were ten, and the fact that the ten were virgins. Most of the commentaries I read, however, made a big deal out of both points. A common refrain was that not every virgin ended up being invited to the feast. That is, we are not saved by an absence of sinful action. Instead, that is the bare minimum. We still require the Almighty‚Äôs grace to be able to love truly.</p>
<p>In connection to the First Reading, the Gospel divides the virgins into the foolish and the wise. Wisdom, as the commentaries said, is knowledge of the three Divine Persons. It‚Äôs said that to know G-d is to love Him, and I think that‚Äôs an appropriate sentiment for this reading.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write 1700 words for NaNoWriMo? I did! I found that it was really helpful to center myself and take some time before writing to decide what I wanted to write today.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb? Despite the fact that I wrote three hundred or so words of Jeb today, I think that from now on I‚Äôm going to take Sundays off. There are a few reasons for this, most of which boil down to the fact that we are called to dedicate a day each week to the Lord. Writing my web serial, for all that I enjoy it, is not a particularly prayerful action to me. The priest today warned of spiritual sloth in his homily, and that stuck with me.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? Two drafts! As yesterday, the second draft is much tighter than the first.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? Not yet. I will before bed, though.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing better at prayer than a rushed and thoughtless rosary? Honestly, I think that writing this was somewhat prayerful, if only because it forced me to reflect on what I heard at mass a little more. There‚Äôs a voice in my head that suggests that doing this reflection before Mass could be even more beneficial, but I also spent a few hours on it, so that may not be as doable.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing a good job writing letters to friends? I wrote a letter, which is a good job in my books.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As with yesterday, I think I‚Äôm going to do this musing in two drafts. I found that it was much easier to write the first draft knowing that I would be able to revise anything I said, and I felt like I was able to explore much better. With that in mind, let‚Äôs see where my mind takes me.</p>
<p>Today‚Äôs readings, as is apparently always true at the end of a liturgical year, concern death and the afterlife. For once, the second reading actually connects really well to the Gospel, in that both are incredibly oriented towards the end times and the Christian message of awaiting the next life. The second reading definitely explains where the concept of the rapture comes from, at least to me. If I read the line about the faithful being carried to heaven, I could absolutely see where people would think that is what happens, especially if I come from a tradition which rejects Tradition.</p>
<p>Anyways, one thing that the priest mentioned today‚Äôs homily was a question I hadn‚Äôt thought about when I listened to the readings today. Why didn‚Äôt the women waiting with oil share it with the ones who did not have enough to keep their lamps lit? He brushed past the question, but it‚Äôs been sticking with me since he mentioned it.</p>
<p>Of course, the answers I come to need to work both in the context of the parable and in the context of what the parable is implying. I‚Äôm going to address only in the context of the parable for now, throwing out plausible ideas without exploring them, and then explore them in the context of the parable, and only then explore them in the context of the Gospel message. I feel like there‚Äôs a benefit in that approach, which is that it lets me get past the initial impulses I have much more quickly.</p>
<p>Ideas for what the maidens<a href="#fn005" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> who did not share their oil were thinking, in no particular order, and assuming nothing about the maidens‚Äô intent:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>They might not have enough oil if they share it</p></li>
<li><p>It‚Äôs on the ones who forgot the oil, not them</p></li>
<li><p>Eliminate competition</p></li>
<li><p>Don‚Äôt have spare money for oil</p></li>
<li><p>Were themselves running low once they had topped off their lamps</p></li>
<li><p>Different lamps?</p></li>
<li><p>The other maidens did not ask them to share?<a href="#fn006" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Teach them a lesson about being prepared?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>That‚Äôs really as many ideas as I can think of right now. I should read some commentaries to see what theologians have said, and I might spend some time doing that right now.<a href="#fn007" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Ok, let‚Äôs see how each interpretation stands up to textual scrutiny, for all that I‚Äôm not going to read the passage in any sort of explicit context.<a href="#fn008" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>They might not have enough oil if they share it. That‚Äôs supported, because they explicitly say ‚ÄúNo, for there may not be enough for us and you. Go instead to the merchants and buy some for yourselves‚Äù.<a href="#fn009" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>It‚Äôs on the ones who forgot the oil, not them. I feel like the fact that they are explicitly called wise and foolish implies that this reading is at least somewhat supported. However, the fact that they say no, not because of that, but because they do not have enough extra oil, casts that interpretation into a bit of doubt.</p></li>
<li><p>Eliminate competition. This feels too mean spirited, especially since there are no insults exchanged.</p></li>
<li><p>Don‚Äôt have spare money for oil. This feels orthogonal to the overall message. There‚Äôs nothing to support the idea that the foolish would not have repaid the wise for the oil they burned when the night was over, but there is also nothing to support the idea that they were.</p></li>
<li><p>Were themselves running low once they had topped off their lamps. This is somehow a different interpretation than the first, which I suppose may be that if they topped up their lamps and had no extra oil, they would have had to dump the oil out? That seems like something that could be difficult to do. Without being a scholar who knows things like how lamps work, though, I can‚Äôt judge the validity of that take.</p></li>
<li><p>Different lamps? There‚Äôs nothing to suggest that their lamps are anything but standardized.<a href="#fn0010" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Spoiler for the next section, but that also doesn‚Äôt seem to mesh with the idea that the lamps are a stand-in for readiness for heaven. I suppose there‚Äôs a way to make that metaphor work, and I will try it, but I don‚Äôt feel good about it.</p></li>
<li><p>The other maidens did not ask them to share? There is absolutely an interpretation that works where the fact that they demanded, rather than asked, ‚Äú The foolish ones said to the wise, ‚ÄòGive us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.‚Äô‚Äù<a href="#fn0011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>. That being said, I don‚Äôt know if I like that interpretation. The response from the wise maidens does not mention their demanding rather than asking, and I don‚Äôt know whether that works with the broader message. Still, it‚Äôs among the better ideas I‚Äôve had so far.</p></li>
<li><p>Teach them a lesson about being prepared? This one has some merit. If we consider the fact that these virgins might serve this role for a number of bridegrooms, it would be in the foolishs‚Äô best interest to learn to keep oil. If this were the first wedding they attended for, then it would be important that they do not make the mistake in the future. If it is not their first wedding, then they should know better. Ok, this interpretation also gets ranked pretty well.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So, after considering the way the metaphors could work, let‚Äôs rank them. I‚Äôm going to use a fairly absolute scale, calling them each plausible, probably, improbable, or wrong, completely based on my interpretation of the text of the parable as meant for itself.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>They might not have enough oil if they share it. Probable.</p></li>
<li><p>It‚Äôs on the ones who forgot the oil, not them. Plausible.</p></li>
<li><p>Eliminate competition. Wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>Don‚Äôt have spare money for oil. Improbable.</p></li>
<li><p>Were themselves running low once they had topped off their lamps. Plausible.</p></li>
<li><p>Different lamps? Wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>The other maidens did not ask them to share? Improbable.</p></li>
<li><p>Teach them a lesson about being prepared? Plausible.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Cool, now let‚Äôs look at what each of these mean in the broader Gospel message, where the virgins awaiting the bridegroom are Christians awaiting the second coming.<a href="#fn0012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Using that message, let‚Äôs try reading each of the proposed ideas<a href="#fn0013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>. What does the idea mean, in context of the parable‚Äôs intended meaning?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>They might not have enough oil if they share it. I feel like there are a number of ways to interpret oil and fire in this situation. If we say oil is the willingness to wait for the coming of Christ, then it‚Äôs a little hard to see how you could share it at all. I could see an interpretation where there‚Äôs an idea that you only have so much time and energy in a given day, or in your life as a whole. At some point, helping others to find Christ could come in conflict with your own call to holiness, though I am struggling to come up with a particular example. I suppose if you know that singing in the choir actively makes you disconnect from the Mass, then it might be better for you not to sing in the choir? Maybe mass is a bad example, but I feel more comfortable with the claim that helping others may not always be best for your immortal salvation</p></li>
<li><p>It‚Äôs on the ones who forgot the oil, not them. I feel like there‚Äôs not a good way to interpret this in the Gospel message. We are constantly told that we are to love our neighbors as ourselves and to practice radical love. I guess there‚Äôs something in the like idea of how those in heaven must not be sad about those in hell, because definitionally there is not sorrow in heaven? I know I read some non Catholic complaining about Aquinas‚Äôs conclusions re: heaven and hell, but I don‚Äôt remember enough about that or the Saint‚Äôs own words to be confident in that take. There is something to be said in the fact that earthly relationships are goods only in so far as they orient us towards the most vital relationship, that of us with the Lord. If we use that lens, where helping others at the expense of paying what is due to the Lord is wrong, I can see the interpretation having some validity. That is, those who forgot the oil are asking you to risk your salvation for their behalf. The Church, so far as I know, does not say that you should ever put your own path to heaven in jeopardy for the sake of another. Christ famously told someone to let the dead bury the dead,<a href="#fn0014" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> and that you should leave your mother and father and despise everything for the sake of the kingdom. I think that this idea is worth sitting with a little longer, even if I think it‚Äôs mostly good in how it connects to the first idea, rather than as a message in and of itself.</p></li>
<li><p>Eliminate competition. There‚Äôs really no way to sell this idea in context of the Catholic mission. We are called to bring the entirety of Creation with us to eternity with the Father. I think that‚Äôs enough said on that.</p></li>
<li><p>Don‚Äôt have spare money for oil. Ok let‚Äôs see how far we can strain a metaphor. Oil is, on some level, connected with Faith and works. I think implicitly, I‚Äôve been thinking of the lamps as faith and the oil as works. Faith without works, as we know, is dead. Likewise, works without faith, while useful, do not lead to salvation on their own. Even if that interpretation is wrong, I think it‚Äôs a nice one. It does lead to the whole ‚Äúyou are saved by performing some number of good deeds,‚Äù which is explicitly wrong, though does have some elements of working in the metaphor for sharing. After all, Christ calls out people who point to a splinter in their friend‚Äôs eyes to first take out the log in their own eye. There‚Äôs probably something to this, but I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm at a point where I can make that work as a metaphor with my own level of spiritual development.</p></li>
<li><p>Were themselves running low once they had topped off their lamps. Once again, unless the metaphor is that you have to figure out how to pour oil out of a lamp, I don‚Äôt think this metaphor works very differently from the first example. In the latter case, I guess there‚Äôs something to be said for you can‚Äôt retroactively pray on someone‚Äôs behalf.</p></li>
<li><p>Different lamps? One of the Saints<a href="#fn0015" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> said something about how we are not all called to be saints in the same way, even though we are all called to be saints.<a href="#fn0016" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> I guess there‚Äôs also the quote from St. Paul about there being one Spirit but many manifestations, or whichever section discussed how a body requires more than just a finger or a toe.<a href="#fn0017" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>The other maidens did not ask them to share? I don‚Äôt know about this interpretation. Certainly, in the modern day, we are called to respect religious diversity to some extent. I guess I don‚Äôt know whether that extends to the point of not offering the faith to those who don‚Äôt ask. In the context of knowing that the maidens demanded, if not asked, it becomes a little more difficult. Maybe there‚Äôs something to be said in the fact that we cannot make others believe or even act as though they believe, much as we might wish to. I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs anything there, but there might be. The latter idea at least feels somewhat resonant.</p></li>
<li><p>Teach them a lesson about being prepared? Hmm, I did immediately shy away from this take. Then again, I know that I generally shy away from anything that suggests fraternal correction. I guess there‚Äôs absolutely a take to be made that you should encourage people to reform their lives up to and including at the moment of their death. How that intersects with the Second Coming is a little more difficult, but I suppose that the metaphor still holds? Maybe? The fact that this is so clearly about Christ‚Äôs return makes the metaphor hard to connect. After all, we know a posteri<a href="#fn0018" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> that<a href="#fn0019" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> nobody was alive for both his First and Second Comings. We don‚Äôt have multiple chances to get it right.<a href="#fn0020" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, so having now reflected a lot on the Gospel, let‚Äôs look a bit at the other readings.<a href="#fn0021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> Or actually, thanks to the footnotes, I know that there‚Äôs still more to say about the Gospel.</p>
<p>Reading the commentary annotated bible that I have ready access to<a href="#fn0022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a>, there are a few things that stand out:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hilary of Poitiers points out the connection to the Decalogue<a href="#fn0023" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>. He does expound on what the lamps and oil represent. To Bishop and Doctor Hilary of Poiteirs, the oil i the fruit of good works and the vessels are the bodies of the faithful. It‚Äôs an interesting reflection, and one that I find kind of compelling. He ties the sellers of oil to the poor, though I don‚Äôt quite understand how.</p></li>
<li><p>Augustine says that the number five relates to the five senses.<a href="#fn0024" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> In Augustine‚Äôs view, the term virgin is meant to refer to the fact that they have refrained from sin through any of their senses. However, absence of active sin is not enough to earn heaven. He ties the lamps to good works as well, quoting ‚ÄúLet your works shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven,‚Äù as well as ‚Äúlet your loins be girded and your lamps burning.‚Äù Oil to him, represents the fact that we have all good through the Lord, who is Good. We cannot make olives to turn into oil, and likewise, we cannot create goodness. Instead, we can reflect and receive the goodness that the Lord gives us.</p>
<p>Augustine also speaks about the bridegroom‚Äôs delay. To him, the delay is a form of test, showing that their love continues to preserve and glow to the end. He speaks to the wise and foolish both sleeping by referring to sleep in the same way that St. Paul does in the second reading, where it acts as a euphemism for death.</p>
<p>In the rebuke, he sees that they are wise not because they belong anything, but because the wisdom of the Lord is with them. He again connects the oil to works, saying that the oil of the foolish is praise and adulation from man.</p></li>
<li><p>John Chrysostom connects this parable to the one preceding it, about the faithful servant. He points to the difference, where rather than punish, he simply refrains from help. He also points to the poor as being the ones who sell, which still doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. There‚Äôs I think something about how we should not take advantage of the poor, but I don‚Äôt quite get the connection, which does admittedly say more about me than the great thinkers of the Church. St. John Chrysostom points to the fact that they are virgins as a way of showing how worthless everything is without works.<a href="#fn0025" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> Even though virginity is good, it is only good insomuch as it is accompanied by works of mercy. Oil once again denotes good works, while the lamps denote gifts of virginity. That‚Äôs an interesting framing, and one that I had not considered.</p></li>
<li><p>Cornelius a Lapide<a href="#fn0026" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> says similarly that the virgins represent the Church. He connects it somehow to the fact that there was a king who fed the poor, and when told that was beneath his dignity, pointed to Christ saying what we do to the least we do to Him. Ooh, he points to ten as being a symbol of totality. Apparently Jerome and Hilary take the virgins to be all of humanity, the wise as Christians and the foolish as everyone else. He also points to the virgins sleeping as dying. Apparently there‚Äôs an old tradition of not leaving the Easter Vigil before midnight because it‚Äôs believed that A: the plague of firstborns happened at midnight, and B: Christ would come again at midnight. This commentary seems much less directly relating to the parable and much more focused on the Gospel as a whole, which makes interpreting it hard.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Ok so that was interesting and informative. I should absolutely spend more time reading commentary from Doctors of the Church, because much of what they said just instantly resonated within me. Let‚Äôs see what takeaways I have from my notes.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Numerology apparently is something I need to consider.</p></li>
<li><p>the oil absolutely relates to good works, though how exactly, there‚Äôs some disagreement</p></li>
<li><p>the fact that they are called virgins is probably meaningful outside of the Jewish tradition.</p></li>
<li><p>sleep means die</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Alright! That feels like a good place to end my thoughts on the Gospel for this draft. In revising, I‚Äôm certain that I‚Äôll have to tie all of this together in a less rambly fashion<a href="#fn0027" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a>, but for now I think I should move on.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs look at the first reading. Oh gosh, it‚Äôs all about wisdom. Since the Gospel is all about how there are wise and foolish virgins, there is absolutely something related in those. Still, my thoughts at the time of reading it were fairly simple. Wisdom comes to those who seek it<a href="#fn0028" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> and is something you grow in, not something you innately possess.</p>
<p>Rather than spending tons of time<a href="#fn0029" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> trying to come up with my own interpretations, let‚Äôs see what the commentaries have to say.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Pseudo-Augustine<a href="#fn0030" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> says that we can love better by seeking wisdom. That seems reasonable.</p></li>
<li><p>Augustine ties the fact that we cannot know the Father without knowing the Son, and so too with not knowing. It‚Äôs an interesting idea to tie to the Gospel, and I‚Äôll need to digest it at least a little.</p></li>
<li><p>St. Cyril ties wisdom directly to the Holy Spirit, which makes a lot of sense to me. It‚Äôs also probably worth digesting that in context as well.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Though I suppose that there‚Äôs some value in reflecting on the Psalm, I don‚Äôt know if I really feel like I want to. It seems a little ambitious to try to interpret the Pslams when I didn‚Äôt even think to investigate the listed numbers in the reading today. The second reading feels like it should be pretty straightforward, but I‚Äôm not sure if it will be. My immediate interpretation is just that death is not the end, which is a pretty easy Catholic take. It connects pretty clearly to the Gospel, since the early Church writers connect sleep to death in the parable.</p>
<p>Interesting points from the commentaries include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Tertullian points that Christ will come back bodily, which I suppose I‚Äôve never really thought about that much. I guess that I do really see the second coming more in an intellectual than any emotive sense.</p></li>
<li><p>John Chrysostom points out that Paul is directing this letter to the mourning as a way to get hope.</p></li>
<li><p>Augustine says that Paul saying we should not be sad as the heathens are is not saying we should not be sad. Instead, like most priests say at funeral masses in my experience, we are to mourn the loss of relationship, rather than the person‚Äôs cessation.</p></li>
<li><p>Ooh, Carsarius of Arles ties this to the Gospel.</p></li>
<li><p>Ambrose of Milan points out that we are raised in the proper order and to the proper state.</p></li>
<li><p>Bede points out that even Moses was buried. By connecting that to the Transfiguration of the Lord, Bede points out that we already have further hope of being raised<a href="#fn0031" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Anyways, this feels like a good place to finish this first draft. I have some ideas floating around for structuring the second one, but we‚Äôll see how I end up feeling when it comes time to write it.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write 1700 words for NaNoWriMo? I did! Having the notes for where the plot should go and then taking a few minutes to expound on them really did a lot to help me figure out what to write.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb? There‚Äôs a voice in my head that tells me I should take Sundays off from writing the book. I don‚Äôt know if I disagree with it, and honestly, I think that I generally agree with it. That in mind, I‚Äôm going to say the 400 words I wrote for Jeb today are enough.<a href="#fn0032" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a></p></li>

<h1 id="on-embroidery-continued"><a href="embroidery-2.html">On Embroidery Continued</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 November 11</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>Earlier this month, I <a href="embroidery.html">wrote a post</a> where, among other things, I discussed the fact that I‚Äôm now learning to embroider. Specifically, I‚Äôm trying to learn counted thread embroidery, in a style somewhat inspired by Bargello. I‚Äôve finally finished the small squares of vertical and horizontal stripes that I had been using as a way to figure out what the stitches looked like with different numbers of threads. I now have to make a different set of decisions when working on future projects.</p>
<p>On the one hand, more strands makes a prettier looking design.<a href="#fn011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> On the other, it is a massive pain to thread a needle, especially when I start threading it with large numbers of threads. Along with the friends from the first embroidery adventure, I went to a local tea shop, where we all worked on our own threadcraft and drank tea and chatted.</p>
<p>I, as mentioned, finished the test swatches and immediately started work on a test swatch for how to use color. The cross stitching friend continued cross stitching,<a href="#fn012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> and the other two friends both practiced new skills. One kept working on a woven bookmark that they started near the beginning of the month, and the other started a free form<a href="#fn013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> embroidery project from a kit. It was really nice to spend time with friends, and it was equally nice to work on something creative<a href="#fn014" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> without having to connect it to anything profit oriented.<a href="#fn015" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> There‚Äôs something really fulfilling about being able to go from a half formed idea to something real and tangible in just a few minutes. The fact that embroidery, at least how I‚Äôve been doing it, has a really nice texture is just an added bonus.<a href="#fn016" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>I think that in the future I might start looking at higher hole density fabric, though, because as mentioned, threading enough threads onto the needle to make the fabric as thick as I want is a bit of a pain. The smaller the separation between holes, the smaller the thread needs to be. I‚Äôve also learned that there‚Äôs a real and legitimate benefit to doing even numbers of threads, which boils down to only needing to worry about ends at the beginning of each thread, because you can loop and double them over.<a href="#fn017" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write 1700 words for NaNoWriMo? I did! I also plotted my plot plan in a daily manner, which should help.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb? Arguably, since I finished a chapter and started another. In reality, I think I wrote just under my new standard chapter word count, but I know exactly where the next chapter is going, so that‚Äôs probably fine.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? As mentioned, I said I would revise this. Interestingly, when revising, I think I do far less self talk.<a href="#fn018" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> I think that the post is much better for being reduced in length by around half.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? I forgot to do that! I‚Äôll do it now and then finish this revision. I feel a little better post stretching, which is pretty normal, I suppose.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing better at prayer than a rushed and thoughtless rosary? No, but I would like to be. I should spend some time tonight, especially because it‚Äôs still early, disconnecting and praying.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing a good job writing letters to friends? I tried today, which I‚Äôm giving myself credit for. I then realized my pen was basically out of ink and didn‚Äôt want to risk half the letter coming out a different color, so opted against writing anything today.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>I had an idea earlier today to try writing this post in two drafts. There were a few reasons for that. First, as you may have noticed, these posts have been getting longer and ramblier the longer the month has gone on. There are a number of reasons for that, to be certain, but the net result is still a post that gets longer, even when the content may not deserve it. Second, this ‚Äôblog<a href="#fn019" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> was initially created to journal, at least in part, the way that my writing changes as I go through drafts. Though there are still remnants of that process<a href="#fn0110" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>, that part of the idea has more or less fallen by the wayside, for a number of reasons.<a href="#fn0111" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>And so, I thought it could be a fun idea to see what differences come from writing and rewriting the same post. Unfortunately, as I tend to do, I lost track of time. It‚Äôs now late enough that I don‚Äôt really feel like writing two posts.<a href="#fn0112" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Still, I know that I have a tendency to overinflate the difficulty of tasks before I start on them, and there‚Äôs a chance that the same is true now. If so, then that just means that I need to write this post, and I may have the energy needed to rewrite the draft. We‚Äôll see what happens.<a href="#fn0113" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Anyways, onto the meat of the post. I‚Äôve written <a href="embroidery.html">before</a> about how I‚Äôm learning embroidery. Today, I finally finished with my blocking to see how many strands of thread I should use and started on another project.<a href="#fn0114" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> I went to a local tea shop with some friends<a href="#fn0115" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> and we all worked on our own crafts.</p>
<p>I did my counted thread embroidery, the friend of mine who cross stitches cross stitched, another friend is learning how to weave bookmarks and worked on that, and the final friend<a href="#fn0116" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> worked on learning how to do traditional<a href="#fn0117" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> embroidery with a starter kit he got. It was really fun to spend time with friends, and it was also really fun to spend some time working on a craft for its own sake, with full knowledge that the skill will likely never benefit me in any professional sense.<a href="#fn0118" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> There‚Äôs something really fulfilling about having a rough idea for a pattern, trying it out, seeing where you can improve, and then trying again in a matter of minutes. It‚Äôs even nicer when the failed attempt is still pretty and has a nice texture.<a href="#fn0119" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> I think I might want to start looking at getting higher number aida<a href="#fn0120" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a>, because it‚Äôs a massive pain to thread six or more distinct strands of embroidery floss onto a needle to sew. The larger the number, the tighter the grid.<a href="#fn0121" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> Right now I think I‚Äôm using 20 or 24, which I saw a recommendation online for six strands when embroidering. In either case, I‚Äôve also learned that doing even numbers is nicer, because then you can just cut a length of floss twice as long as you want to use and then double it with the needle. There are a fair number of benefits to doing that, most of which revolve around the fact that you don‚Äôt have to worry about the floss falling out of the needle as you sew.<a href="#fn0122" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Ok so wow this post absolutely needs to be cleaned up. Even though it‚Äôs been dark for hours,<a href="#fn0123" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> it‚Äôs still pretty early, so I should have time to revise.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write 1700 words for NaNoWriMo? I did! I also kind of plotted out what my goals are for writing each day plotwise for the rest of the month, which is nice. It made it a little easier to get to the wordcount today, since I had a real goal in mind.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb? I was halfway through a chapter at the end of last night, which I did not end up finishing. I finished that chapter and started on another one, though, which is like writing a chapter. One chapter was finished.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? I did! And I think I‚Äôm even going to revise it wow.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? I should stretch. Before revising, I think that I‚Äôll do that.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing better at prayer than a rushed and thoughtless rosary? I don‚Äôt think that my rosary last night was particularly rushed, and I did pray an Angelus today, though that one was very rushed.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing a good job writing letters to friends? So I did legitimately mean to do a good job writing letters to friends. But, when I went to write letters between embroidery projects, I found that my pen was almost completely empty of ink. That was a shame, but one that I should have remembered, since we‚Äôre like two weeks into the month, and that‚Äôs usually when I run out of ink.</p></li>

<li id="fn0110" role="doc-endnote"><p>see the fact that every post starts with Draft 1 and has a first posted date<a href="#fn01ref10" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">‚Ü©Ô∏é</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0111" role="doc-endnote"><p>ooh I do love lists within lists. Still, I‚Äôll refrain from doing so here, if only because I‚Äôm already almost two hundred words into explaining how I was going to write today‚Äôs musing, which is about embroidery, without even mentioning the skill once.<a href="#fn01ref11" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">‚Ü©Ô∏é</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0112" role="doc-endnote"><p>truthfully, I barely feel like writing one.<a href="#fn01ref12" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">‚Ü©Ô∏é</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0113" role="doc-endnote"><p>oof, three hundred words of filler before I even get to the embroidery. If I do draft 2, this is all absolutely being cut. That does raise the interesting question, though, of what the point of my drafts is (are?). If the goal is to tell the same story with each draft, then I should repeat this content. If, instead, the goal is that each draft attempts to muse most effectively, then I probably shouldn‚Äôt. Eh, we‚Äôll see what I feel like doing to that bridge when it‚Äôs time to cross it, and not before.<a href="#fn01ref13" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">‚Ü©Ô∏é</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0114" role="doc-endnote"><p>ok, to be fair, the new project is also a test swatch, but it‚Äôs a test swatch with a much more intricate pattern, which is like a real project.<a href="#fn01ref14" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">‚Ü©Ô∏é</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0115" role="doc-endnote"><p>I‚Äôm realizing now that the group of us who went to the Embroidery Guild and who went to tea today were identical<a href="#fn01ref15" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">‚Ü©Ô∏é</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0116" role="doc-endnote"><p>not that I only have three friends, just only four of us did all the embroidery events.<a href="#fn01ref16" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">‚Ü©Ô∏é</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0117" role="doc-endnote"><p>honestly I have no clue what the relative age or prestige of different embroidery styles is.

<li id="fn0118" role="doc-endnote"><p>that may sound sarcastic, but I do truly mean it. Ever since I realized that my habit of writing a lot of fiction also transfers to writing academic text faster, I feel bad, as though I have corrupted that joy somehow by making it useful. It‚Äôs a similar feeling I get when friends tell me that I should set up a way for my readers to financially compensate me. It isn‚Äôt that I‚Äôm opposed to making money off the work that I do, it‚Äôs that a part of me feels like it will stop being a hobby and start being a job, and that will change my desire to write/what I write. I don‚Äôt know how valid that fear is, but it‚Äôs one that I‚Äôve had for a while, ever since I read an article talking about how paying children to solve puzzles makes them solve fewer puzzles than just telling them to do it because it‚Äôs a fun activity. Once again, I feel like I‚Äôm getting off the point of the post, though. It will be fun to actually do a word count versus footnote count again for this post, because I‚Äôm beyond certain that there are more footnotes than in text words for this post.<a href="#fn01ref18" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">‚Ü©Ô∏é</a></p></li>

<h1 id="flash-fiction-friday"><a href="flash-fiction.html">Flash Fiction Friday</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 November 10</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>There‚Äôs a tumblr called Flash Fiction Friday Official. I‚Äôm not entirely sure why they feel the need to call themselves official, given that I haven‚Äôt seen anyone else claiming the title, but it‚Äôs that nonetheless. The concept is fairly simple. Every Friday, they<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> post a new prompt, and anyone can respond to the prompt for the next 24 ish hours.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve done it a few times. At first, I tended to do some short form fiction. As time went on, and I felt less inclined to write small short stories, I used it as a way to write some poetry. Of course, I‚Äôve fallen almost completely off the wagon of doing the prompts at all.</p>
<p>Today, since I‚Äôm a little over a week into my one month goal of writing as much as possible, I looked to see what the prompt was. It was ‚ÄúBy any other name‚Äù, which of course made me initially think of the Shakespearean reference. I immediately wrote that line down and thought about how untrue it was in so many situations.</p>
<p>Of course, that immediately pushed my mind into something poetic. I don‚Äôt think that I want to write a poem today for the prompt, if only because poems take me far longer per word and I haven‚Äôt really been writing any poetry recently. So, that means I need to write prose.</p>
<p>One interesting thing I‚Äôve realized about my FFF<a href="#fn022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> responses is that they tend to be far more emotionally driven and first person centered than most of my writing. In part, I think that‚Äôs because they tend to be far more poetic, and I find that my poetry tends to be much more emotionally connected than my prose writing.<a href="#fn023" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Since I didn‚Äôt want to write a poem, I then started thinking of what story I could tell. Because the prompts are ‚ÄúFlash Fiction‚Äù, there is a maximum word count of I think 1000.<a href="#fn024" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> That‚Äôs both a lot of words and not very many all at once.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm not writing fanfiction, unlike a large number of the people who respond to the prompts.<a href="#fn025" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> In some regards, this adds to the struggle. In the very limited words I have, I need to not only introduce characters and scene, but then have something happen. When working with fanfic, these constraints are slightly different.</p>
<p>With a single name, you can give the audience the entire background of a known character. There are of course many difficulties to writing fanfic that are not true of an original story. Because I‚Äôm creating the entire world wholesale, nothing I do in the 1000 or fewer words can be contradictory to what people know about the characters. If I was using established works, though, then I would have to be careful to explain why my own interpretation diverges from the canon, if it does.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm not planning on writing the actual story for the day in this blog post, if only to keep the slightest barrier between the different online presences I maintain. I do want to spend some time and words considering the story I want to write, though.</p>
<p>I think that I want to talk about how changing a name does, in fact, change the thing it describes. Maybe it‚Äôs just that I spend too much time around scientists, but there‚Äôs a lot of thoughts around me that language does not, in and of itself, contain any meaning or power. I‚Äôm sure the fact that I read lots of fantasy inspired by Earthsea also leads me to the idea of names being important in and of themselves, but.<a href="#fn026" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Probably because of the literary inspirations, I have the initial idea to write something fantasy adjacent. I‚Äôve also got the voice in my head telling me that I should write a very emotional and relationship focused story, for a few reasons.<a href="#fn027" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Something that keeps popping into my mind is also the idea of how a relationship is, in many regards, defined by the words we use to describe it.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt want to write a didactic story, where I expound on that explicitly.<a href="#fn028" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> However, being too subtle comes with its own drawbacks. I don‚Äôt have hundreds of thousands of words to carefully dance around a topic. The medium really encourages direct, if not blatant writing.</p>
<p>Ok, I do feel pretty strongly that it‚Äôs in my best interest as a writer to do some realistic fiction exploring relationships. Now I suppose I should figure out the perspective. First person has the advantage of feeling intimate right away. Third person has the advantage of seeming objectivity, which contrasts to the emotional statement that I‚Äôm trying to make. Second person has the advantage of being a little weird, and in many ways feeling even more intimate.</p>
<p>From that little reflection, it definitely seems like I‚Äôm leaning towards second person. Ok, so then the question becomes who I‚Äôm addressing.<a href="#fn029" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> That question also goes hand in hand with the presentation style.</p>
<p>Lately I‚Äôve really fallen in love with epistolary fiction.<a href="#fn0210" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Some famous examples include much of Dracula and This is How You Lose the Time War. I like the fact that there‚Äôs an explicit passing of time, and I also like the way it connects me to the letters I write to friends generally.</p>
<p>Ok, so then the question becomes how many letters to send and what story/ plot I want to send out.<a href="#fn0211" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> So, things that I know I want are a relationship developing. Since I have such a limited word count, it could make some sense to start not at the first meeting.</p>
<p>I think I want it to take place more or less in the present, so I probably need to address why they‚Äôre writing letters to each other. Starting it with just like ‚ÄúI see why Dr. so and so recommended we write each other letters‚Äù could be fun. Ooh hey, look at that, we‚Äôve got an implication of them going through marital issues. Ok so I guess that is a question, do I want the couple to be married already?</p>
<p>Ooh, something fun I could do is start each of the letters with a different name, like (person), then love, then etc..<a href="#fn0212" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> That feels maybe a little forced, but maybe it could work. With a thousand words, I have room for five to seven of the standard length letters I write, which is pretty nice for storytelling purposes.</p>
<p>Ok to frame this for me<a href="#fn0213" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>: second person, directed in an epistolary fashion, where I use the openings of each letter as a way of framing what the emotions are at each point. I should probably brainstorm a few different names, but I think I‚Äôm ready to try writing the story for today! Exciting.</p>
<p>Well, I have a rough draft done. It‚Äôs about 500 words, which is nice and in the middle of the allowed word count. I don‚Äôt know if I love the story as a whole, so far, but I think that there‚Äôs some potential in what I have. I think that author‚Äôs notes are allowed, so I might throw one in and go ‚Äúso this is what I was trying to do, idk if it worked though.‚Äù There‚Äôs always a part of me that cringes at author‚Äôs notes that try to explain what their goal was in creating a work, but I don‚Äôt really know if there‚Äôs any way around it. Anyways, I feel like I should probably try to revise the story.</p>
<p>Update a few hours later: I no longer feel like there‚Äôs enough time in the day for me to feel like I want to edit the short story. I also don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll post it. On the one hand, it isn‚Äôt bad writing, and I kind of like the story. On the other, I can tell a bunch of ways that it could be much stronger, which is almost always true for something I write. I don‚Äôt know what my goal is in putting the writing out there, I guess.</p>
<p>I suppose that for the people who make the prompts, seeing responses is probably validating on some level. They do also tend to repost anything you submit with compliments. Ok, the more I think about it, the more that I feel like I should just post it and accept that it‚Äôs not as strong as it could be. Maybe I‚Äôll be lucky and someone will be willing to comment on how to make the story better.<a href="#fn0214" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Well, it‚Äôs posted now. We‚Äôll see if I get any interaction with it. In either case, I will probably forget it exists for a while, because I posted it from my writing tumblr, which is very far from connected to my real one. My real one is also kept fairly isolated from any other social media that I keep, which probably says something, but I don‚Äôt really want to get into what it says.</p>
<p>I might try to look at the post/ the prompt in the future when I run out of things to write about, but for now, I‚Äôm just going to leave it in the drafts.</p>
<p>For all that this is probably a rambling mess, I think that it was actually really helpful for me to think about what I wanted to write today. Maybe I should spend more time doing free writing to plan out the books/whatever I want to write in the future. It‚Äôs certainly something that‚Äôs worth thinking about. Maybe tomorrow before I write for NaNo I‚Äôll spend some time thinking about where, exactly, I‚Äôm trying to lead the story.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write 1700 words for NaNoWriMo? I did! I also have in the intermediate days that I haven‚Äôt posted here.<a href="#fn0215" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb? I finally finished the chapter I‚Äôve been working on for a few days and I‚Äôm halfway through another chapter. I‚Äôm hoping to have enough energy to finish it off before I go to bed, but we‚Äôll see.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? So I have managed to write a post every day this month. The past two days, though, I haven‚Äôt felt comfortable posting them to the semi public reality that is my website. Is that still a blog post? Great question.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? It‚Äôs been far too long since I stretched. After finishing this, though, I‚Äôll do it.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing better at prayer than a rushed and thoughtless rosary? No. My prayer life is starting to suffer, which in part is probably because of how sick I‚Äôve been feeling these past few days. Still, that isn‚Äôt really an excuse, so I‚Äôll make sure to pray tonight.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing a good job writing letters to friends? I‚Äôm ready to write letters tomorrow, but I‚Äôm ok with the fact that I didn‚Äôt write any today either. I‚Äôm sick and I need to be ok with that fact.</p></li>

<h1 id="pathfinder-again"><a href="pathfinder-2.html">Pathfinder Again</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 November 7</p>
<p>As I alluded to <a href="dungeons-dragons-5.html">yesterday</a>, I‚Äôm currently playing a Pathfinder 2E campaign with some friends. It‚Äôs an interesting concept, where we groundhog‚Äôs day<a href="#fn031" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> back to the start of the dungeon every time that we die. Due in large part to that being the agreed upon mechanic, the game is primarily combat focused.</p>
<p>Our GM had the stated goal of getting better at creating and executing combats during the course of the campaign. He is one of my alleged cousins,<a href="#fn032" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> and the party consists of me, my brother<a href="#fn033" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, the GM‚Äôs brother<a href="#fn034" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>, and the GM‚Äôs former roommate.<a href="#fn035" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> It‚Äôs been a fun experience, in large part because of the lack of consequences. Often when I play DnD or an equivalent game, I try very hard to both focus on the specific combat and having a good time there and also on the broader story arc. That can be a little exhausting, because fighting optimally is fun for me, but is not necessarily reflective of the characters I enjoy roleplaying outside of combat.<a href="#fn036" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> In this game, however, I‚Äôve decided to play a character who is concerned about the fact that he hasn‚Äôt died yet.</p>
<p>More than that, the DM has given us free reign to rewrite our character sheets between attempted delves, which adds a layer of dehumanization as an RP‚Äôer. My character no longer really knows what is real, since he truly remembers being born of Black Dragons, but now seems to be born of Blue Dragon.<a href="#fn037" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> It‚Äôs been really fun, and I‚Äôm excited to play again. The rest of the post will be written tonight, when we‚Äôre finished with the session. It may be a first person log, from my character, depending on how I feel.</p>
<p>Well, this time I was the only fatality. The issue with playing a game where everyone<a href="#fn038" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> has an undergraduate degree in chemistry, and the majority of us are getting degrees in something at least vaguely related to chemistry is that you run into some dangerously real world interactions. In PF2e, there‚Äôs a Class<a href="#fn039" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> that allows you to create metal structures. There are a number of monsters which create acid, which our GM ruled can erode metal structures, because metal, as we know, dissolves in acid.</p>
<p>One of our group members, being a chemist, recognized the redox reaction that implies. Iron, when dissolved in acid, converts to Iron Oxide. The oxygen, obviously, comes from somewhere. In the case of dissolving in acid, that tends to come from water.</p>
<p>Now, water, as we all know, is made of two hydrogens and an oxygen. When you pull the oxygen out of water, you are left with hydrogen. Through potentially relevant situations, the monster we were fighting ended up on fire.<a href="#fn0310" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> When the monster then ate away what the GM decided was 60 pounds of iron, that meant that we had reacted away approximately 550 moles of iron.</p>
<p>That ended up making something around 1200 liters of hydrogen gas.<a href="#fn0311" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> The GM ruled that was worth 40 d6 fire damage. I, stupidly, had just jumped next to the monster, and so was caught in the blast as well. Had I been at full health, it would have almost killed me at once. Since I was doing my job as a bartender and tanking the hit, I completely died at once. I‚Äôm excited to be revived next week, and to have learned absolutely no lessons from the experience.</p>
<p>Update a few minutes later: I apparently got to come back to life.<a href="#fn0312" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Now we‚Äôre going sailing, for some reason.<a href="#fn0313" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> Thankfully, I have taken the nicest feat in pathfinder<a href="#fn0314" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> We found a river drake, and through situations completely outside of our control<a href="#fn0315" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> it tried to fight us. It‚Äôs very fun being a barbarian, because my strategy is very simple. If I am close enough to punch, I use a war flail and smash it. If not, I either throw a bomb or a javelin, depending on how much of a threat the object appears.</p>
<p>In the case of the water drake, it was very easy to dispatch, likely due to the fact that we are all fifth level and got a turn off before it did. With a couple of lucky criticals, we dispatched it before it had a chance to fight. A part of me feels bad, but that voice is a small one. I realized the group did not know that I dislike dragons, which is the only part I feel bad about.</p>
<p>We then encountered some other creatures that also do not speak Draconic. As a result, we were able to tell them that the river drake had attacked us for no reason. Unfortunately, they also wanted the eggs, so we had a bit of a disagreement over how to make that happen. After offering them other foods, they tried to fight us.<a href="#fn0316" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Annoyingly enough, I failed my single attack roll, which meant that I mostly just stood around as the rest of the party killed the monsters. I did my job, however, and soaked up the damage that they wanted to output. In such a regard, I really do a great job of playing damage sponge for the group.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write 1700 words for NaNoWriMo? Once again, it was a successful day of writing for NaNo. I still don‚Äôt love the story, and I don‚Äôt think that I‚Äôm going to at any point, but that‚Äôs fine. It‚Äôs good for me to do something I only kind of enjoy sometimes.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb? So, I did not end up finishing last night‚Äôs chapter. It ended up being exactly six hundred words shy, which I wrote this morning during my hour of writing time with a friend.<a href="#fn0317" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> I have not yet finished today‚Äôs chapter of Jeb, but I have hope that I will do so before I go to sleep. If not, I‚Äôll have to finish it tomorrow as well, or accept that a long chapter of a book a day may be too optimistic of a goal for me to take on in addition to everything else I‚Äôve done. I did, semi-relatedly, write a 1200 word draft of a methods section for a manuscript my PI has asked me to start writing. Maybe that explains some of my lack of desire to keep writing right now. For all that my creative writing total is about 5200 words today, my total wordcount is apparently closer to 7000<a href="#fn0318" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Update as I kept working on this blog post: I‚Äôm now much closer to 6000 creative words today, and I‚Äôm almost positive that I‚Äôll finish the chapter tonight, if only because I still have like a hundred words left to write and I have nothing to write here.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? Did I ever! Look at me, continuing to send out content into the void that is the website I have.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? I ended up falling asleep midstretch last night, which isn‚Äôt great. After this post posts, I‚Äôll start.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing better at prayer than a rushed and thoughtless rosary? Not really, honestly. My rosary last night was done while half asleep. I did the Angelus today, and I tried to focus on it, though.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing a good job writing letters to friends? Not today! I got another friend‚Äôs address, which is a form of progress, I suppose. In terms of putting ink<a href="#fn0319" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> on paper, though, I did not make any progress. There‚Äôs always tomorrow.</p></li>

<h1 id="dungeons-and-dragons-again"><a href="dungeons-dragons-5.html">Dungeons and Dragons Again</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 November 6</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Oh gosh, it‚Äôs been a long time since <a href="dungeons-dragons-5.html">the last time I blogged about dnd.</a> I had a fun campaign with that druid, though it fizzled out for reasons.<a href="#fn041" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Since then, I‚Äôve started playing pathfinder with another set of friends, and I just had the session zero for another dnd campaign that‚Äôs about to start. I‚Äôve realized that I really enjoy playing a simple character in DnD, probably because my own life is less than simple. Barbarian is a class that tends to take a direct path to the solution of each of its goals, which is something that I really like.</p>
<p>This character is a plasmoid<a href="#fn042" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> zealot barbarian<a href="#fn043" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref3"><sup>3</sup></a> For my background, I took something that was called like raised by giants, which has the fun effect of making my first attack each turn do even more damage. It‚Äôs going to be a fun character to role play and roll play<a href="#fn044" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref4"><sup>4</sup></a>, and I‚Äôm excited to hang out with these friends more.</p>
<p>One consequence of session zero just happening today, though, is that I lost the evening, which is when I tend to do a majority of my writing. I was told that the event would end by half past eight at the latest, but then we started chatting and playing other games. I certainly don‚Äôt regret the time I spent with them, for all that it will absolutely make getting to my writing goal today a little more difficult.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt have much more to add about this, so I may as well start brainstorming some information about my character. I randomly rolled myself into Neutral Evil, which I think means that I‚Äôm intrinsically selfish but have a normal attachment to the laws. I think that works well with the background I gave my character, who I‚Äôm realizing probably deserves a name. Let‚Äôs go with Goob.</p>
<p>Goob landed in the wild mountains outside of (insert setting‚Äôs mountains)<a href="#fn045" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref5"><sup>5</sup></a> when it was a small creature.<a href="#fn046" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref6"><sup>6</sup></a> As I grew, surrounded by the giants, they adopted me as one of their own.</p>
<p>I always knew that I was different than the other children. For one, they never seemed to relax quite as much as I did, always holding onto their weird bones. For another, they were all much larger than me. Still, I grew up loved and supported, as much as my parents were capable of expressing what that meant.</p>
<p>In time, I grew older and chose a path for myself. Something about the stark beauty of the mountains called to me, and I found myself meditating on the beauty that I saw. One day, some goblins<a href="#fn047" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref7"><sup>7</sup></a> came up to our mountain and disturbed the peace. I felt a divine presence guiding my blows as I grew more enraged, throwing the goblins off of the cliff.</p>
<p>When the fight was over, I found that I had gone into what my people called a battle trance. It did not seem safe for me to stay among them any more, for what if I did something I would later regret while under the throes of a trance? I went down the mountain to learn to control the urges that called me towards violence.</p>
<p>While in the (insert name of whatever political entity the campaign starts in)<a href="#fn048" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref8"><sup>8</sup></a>, I began to make a name for myself as a sword for sale. Well, to be more accurate, as a battleaxe for hire. I joined with<a href="#fn049" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref9"><sup>9</sup></a> my party because (insert whatever plot reason here). My dream is to control my rage well enough that I am once again safe to live with the other giants.<a href="#fn0410" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write 1700 words for NaNoWriMo? I did! I don‚Äôt love the way that the story is going still, but I‚Äôm hopeful that it‚Äôll start to turn around. If not, eh, I will finish it anyways because I want to practice some skills that writing it will help me practice. Maybe if I start each session with what I hope to learn, I‚Äôll do a better job of writing.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb? I‚Äôm about a fifth to a sixth of the way through. I‚Äôm planning to finish the chapter after posting this blog, since writing the blog felt easier when I got home.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? Wow! Another day with another blog post.<a href="#fn0411" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? Whoops! Need to stretch still.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing better at prayer than a rushed and thoughtless rosary? My rosary wasn‚Äôt rushed last night, but it wasn‚Äôt particularly good. I did the Angelus at around noon, but it was somewhat thoughtless.<a href="#fn0412" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing a good job writing letters to friends? I did end up addressing another letter to a friend last night, and I posted the letter that I wrote on Saturday this morning. That‚Äôs technically progress, so I‚Äôm counting it.</p></li>

<h1 id="reflections-on-todays-gospel"><a href="reflections-on-readings-31-ordinary-a-23.html">Reflections on Today‚Äôs Gospel</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 November 5</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>It‚Äôs been quite a while since my last reflection on the Sunday Mass readings. There are a number of reasons for that, but especially in light of <a href="christian-writing.html">my recent musing where I said I wanted to do more religious writing,</a> spending a musing a week explicitly reflecting on the Bible feels like a good way to practice that. Also, since the last time that I‚Äôve written a reflection on the readings, I finally learned at least one reason I tend to have trouble connecting the first reading and Gospel to the second reading. According to the notes in the edition of the Bible I use most, the Gospel passages were chosen to try to give a relatively full accounting of the different Gospels over the three year sequence. Each of the first readings is chosen to match the Gospel, whether by showing something prophetic Christ did, or simply just by focusing on similar themes. The second readings, however, are not chosen to match the other two. Instead, they are just supposed to trace through the letters, with the goal of giving a good summary of each letter.<a href="#fn051" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Anyways, nearly two hundred and fifty words later, let‚Äôs talk about today‚Äôs readings. The first reading comes from the book of Malachi, which I‚Äôve now learned is the final of the twelve minor prophets in the Bible, and is the final book before Matthew in almost every translation of the Christian Bible. Malachi, as it turns out, means messenger, which leads some to believe that the name of the book is referencing a title, rather than the given name of the author.</p>
<p>The first reading is a warning to the priests of the Jewish people. It can be read a number of ways, I am certain. However, the choice of Gospel passage makes it clear to me what interpretation we‚Äôre expected to take from the reading.</p>
<p>In the Gospel, Christ talks about the way that the Pharisees and scribes of the people are not living in accord with the covenant the Almighty established over His people. Despite that, Christ acknowledges, along with, it seems, every Gospel and New Testament Letter writer, that the Pharisees still have authority over the people of Israel. He says ‚Äúdo and observe all things whatsoever they tell you,‚Äù<a href="#fn052" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> before immediately warning the listeners not to act as the Pharisees do.</p>
<p>That is an interesting admonition for me to reflect on. I feel like I tend to have difficulty accepting truths that come from people who I know do not act according to them. If someone tells me that something is healthy and will make me a better person, but does not do it themselves, there is a level of disconnect that I personally struggle to connect through. And yet, as the Gospel points out, this is not a unique or novel situation that I find myself in.</p>
<p>There are two ways that I can read the instruction.<a href="#fn053" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> First, people in authority over us making orders that are within the standards of their authority should generally be obeyed.<a href="#fn054" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> That is, if a boss tells his employees to clean the building, that is his right.<a href="#fn055" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> If the employees do not clean, even if the boss does not, then they are in the wrong.<a href="#fn056" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>The other way that I can understand this is that people can be flawed and recognize that about themselves. I, for instance, know that exercising regularly makes me feel better physically and emotionally. I know the same is true for me about having a regular prayer life. Despite this, I do not exercise regularly, and my prayer life<a href="#fn057" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> needs plenty of work. If someone was feeling generally down about things, I would<a href="#fn058" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> advise them to try praying and exercising more. Even though I do not do it, it‚Äôs still good advice.</p>
<p>How much more true can that be for people who have dedicated their lives to studying and interpreting the Word of the Almighty? When a priest or bishop today makes a theological point that I disagree with, I have to recognize that he has gone through significantly more formal theological training than me. Even when what they say is clearly wrong to me, it is still worth the time it takes to understand where they are getting their thoughts from.</p>
<p>In the time that Christ was preaching, the Pharisees were the voice of the people, speaking with Mosaic authority, rather than the priestly power that the Sadducees spoke with.<a href="#fn059" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> It‚Äôs interesting that we start today with a reading discussing how the priestly caste will be ignored, and then we see Christ disagreeing with the major opposition to the priestly caste. I‚Äôm sure that there‚Äôs something deep and profound in the framing, but I can‚Äôt find it right now.</p>
<p>The second reading, in stark contrast, is simply a message of evangelization. We, as Catholics, are called to spread the faith to the whole world. I know that I‚Äôm not great about doing that, both because I am afraid to evangelize and because I do not live a good Catholic life. There is nothing I can do but try better tomorrow.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write 1700 words for NaNoWriMo? I did, but I don‚Äôt really like where the story is going right<a href="#fn0510" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> now. I hope that‚Äôll change tomorrow, but I‚Äôm worried it won‚Äôt.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb? I finished the chapter that I started last night. It felt either like a really strong chapter or a really weak chapter. My beta reader thought it was an incredibly strong chapter, which is nice. I think I‚Äôm a little in my head about the book because I got a review which glowed about how different my writing style is from the normal. I didn‚Äôt think I had a distinctive tone, so that was a bit of a shock to me.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? See that? It‚Äôs been almost a full week of daily posts, all of which are quadruple digits.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? Oops! I‚Äôll stretch when I post this.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing better at prayer than a rushed and thoughtless rosary? My rosary was incredibly rushed last night, I did a rushed Angelus today, and I struggled to pay attention during Mass. So, all in all, prayer is not going great.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing a good job writing letters to friends? Shoot! I knew I forgot something. Ok, before I stretch, I‚Äôll address the letter that I wrote last night so that I can post it in the morning. Depending how I feel after a few minutes away from the computer, I may also write another letter or at least address an envelope.</p></li>

<li id="fn051" role="doc-endnote"><p>I‚Äôm less positive of this claim, but it‚Äôs what I remember interpreting the answer as.

<h1 id="on-embroidery"><a href="embroidery.html">On Embroidery</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 November 4</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>I think I mentioned this in my <a href="reflection-october-23.html">last monthly reflection</a>, but last month I went to an embroidery showcase!<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> It was a really cool experience, in part because i hadn‚Äôt realized how diverse the field of embroidery was. I had in my mind an image of just like the way you can add a small pop of color to a piece of clothing as the whole of embroidery.<a href="#fn062" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> I was<a href="#fn063" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> wrong about that.</p>
<p>The first exhibit<a href="#fn064" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> was a display of temari balls. Temari, as the display informed us, is a Japenese form of embroidery where you make intricate<a href="#fn065" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> designs in a ball filled with rice hulls.<a href="#fn066" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> The designs were beautiful, and they had pieces at every level of finish, beginning with raw rice hulls and ending with a beautiful almost fractal pattern.<a href="#fn067" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>That, of course, was only the first table we saw. There was a lot of free form embroidery, which I had expected. There was also a lot of cross stitch, which I had not realized was considered a part of embroidery. Again, in retrospect, it makes sense that cross stitch would be featured in the Embroidery Guild, if only because the materials and skills cross over so well between the two hobbies.</p>
<p>There was another kind of embroidery that instantly caught my attention, however: counted thread embroidery. Similar to cross stitch, it is worked in a regular fabric<a href="#fn068" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Unsurprisingly, as a child of the digital age,<a href="#fn069" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> the fact that the designs were worked onto grids was fascinating to me. By and large, the designs worked in counted thread embroidery did not rely on different stitches to add texture and design elements, instead relying on color, material, and to a small extent, thickness of worked thread to make their designs.</p>
<p>Anyways, as the four of us walked through the exhibit, we were stopped multiple times by older women who encouraged us to join the guild. It was really sweet, and all of us were tempted, though I think we all decided independently to wait to join until next year. When one of the recruiters found out that we were all getting our Ph. D.s in Chemistry<a href="#fn0610" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>, she was elated and told us that there was a former chemical engineer for the state DNR in the guild. We met her, and we bonded a little bit over the fact that embroidery, especially counted thread embroidery and cross stitch, are very rewarding if you have the sort of mind that a Ph. D. chemist does.<a href="#fn0611" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>In a fun turn of events, she was the one who had set up the temari ball exhibit, and was more than happy to tell us a lot more about the craft. It was fascinating to consider the fact that a lot of the skills I‚Äôve been working to develop as an analytical chemist<a href="#fn0612" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> apply really well to a craft like making a temari ball. The fact that all four of us had taken a course on machining and CAD made the conversation all the more enjoyable.</p>
<p>When we‚Äôd gone through all of the art at the show, we stopped by the sale they had. I got a book on designing Bargello patterns, mostly because it was filled with pretty designs and had a section explaining terminology. The others each got their own different books, and we went to a craft store to get supplies.</p>
<p>Since then, I‚Äôve started trying to learn how to embroider. Right now, I‚Äôm still new enough that I keep being surprised to learn things. It‚Äôs fun, especially since I haven‚Äôt been a novice in this way in something for a long time. Dealing with not knowing what questions I should be asking is a skill I‚Äôve let fall a little bit by the wayside, especially during my latest degree, which is meant to focus almost entirely on delving deeply into one or two small questions. Still, it‚Äôs something that I really enjoy, especially because I can see the ways that it intersects with so many other skills that I have or want to have at some point. The fact that there will be a social aspect to the craft in the future, as my friends and I join the guild, only adds to that.</p>
<p>For all that the only print resource I have for embroidery is a book on designing Bargello patterns, I do not think that I will likely end up doing too much Bargello work. Bargello embroidery, for those not in the know, is a form of counted thread embroidery based off of some extant art in Bargello, Italy. Its emblematic style<a href="#fn0613" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> is relatively long vertical stitches being used to the exclusion of any other stitch. As a person who personally loves the textural differences that vertical and horizontal lines can make, I don‚Äôt think that I‚Äôll be too reliant on the style. That being said, I am also now enough of an adult to do the scales of my different hobbies.<a href="#fn0614" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> I‚Äôm perfectly willing to believe that practicing a simple Bargello pattern will become essential for my development as a fiber artist, and I‚Äôm willing to grit my teeth and bear it, even if I do hate working on the pattern.<a href="#fn0615" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Thus far, I‚Äôve almost exclusively made a small pattern with gradually increasing numbers of threads, to see the way that the shape differs as it gets thicker. It‚Äôs interesting that the object seems shorter when it has more threads, especially since I can pull out a ruler and see that the grid based fabric is, in fact, still a grid. I also find that I generally like the more filled in look more, which makes a fair amount of sense. I‚Äôve always been interested in texture as a part of creative media, but that interest has tended to be more in the way that light reacts<a href="#fn0616" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> with the media being worked. I suppose the canvas I‚Äôm stitching into is, in many regards, the media I‚Äôm working, but it doesn‚Äôt really feel like it, at least right now. There is a part of me that really does enjoy looking at the canvas underneath the thread, which I‚Äôm now realizing might be my issue.</p>
<p>I do enjoy negative space in art, but I tend to feel like its use needs to be intentional. Right now, the designs I‚Äôm working don‚Äôt feel like the sort of art that need explicit negative space. It‚Äôs more than plausible that I will change my opinion as I continue into the craft and make more intricate artwork. In fact, I‚Äôm almost positive that I will find a use case for nearly every thickness of thread I‚Äôve worked so far. I just don‚Äôt know that they‚Äôll be my standard block.</p>
<p>Anyways, this has been a shockingly long and rambling musing. In summary<a href="#fn0617" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>, I went to an embroidery show with friends a few weeks ago. It was filled with really cool art and decorations. I‚Äôve started embroidering and I really enjoy it.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, <a href="writers-block-5.html">one day ago today</a> I sat in front of my computer without any idea what I would blog about. Today I have a slightly different issue. I am going to play games with friends tonight,<a href="#fn071" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and had<a href="#fn072" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> every intention of musing about that experience. However, as I may have mentioned before,<a href="#fn073" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> I‚Äôve started writing on a website which I find very helpful for getting me to write often and well.

<p>Unfortunately, though the overlap is close, it does not always align perfectly with the number of words that I have left to write in a chapter of my web novel. In this case, I finished a longer than standard chapter with 200 or so words in my arbitrary goal.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut wait,‚Äù I hear you<a href="#fn074" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> ask, ‚Äúwhy not simply let those remaining words go to waste? Or, even better, why not simply start another chapter?‚Äù</p>

<h1 id="on-christian-writing"><a href="christian-writing.html">On Christian Writing</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 November 2</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p><a href="nanowrimo-5.html">Yesterday</a> I talked about how my goal for this NaNoWriMo is writing something more explicitly Christian. I said that I did not have the time or energy to discuss what that meant in that post, and I do stand by that. However, as I tossed and turned in my bed last night, I thought about what it means to have Christian writing.</p>
<p>Of course, like anything else, the concept exists in a spectrum. At one end is something like the Golden Compass, which is a fiction book meant to mock and denigrate the Church.<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> At the other end of the spectrum<a href="#fn082" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> is something like Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger‚Äôs <em>Jesus of Nazareth</em>, which is wholly a reflection on the Lord, more a work of theology than of creative writing.<a href="#fn083" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Closer to the areligious side would be the works of Ernest Hemmingway, a devout<a href="#fn084" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Catholic who actively tried to avoid being labeled as such in his writings. My scale may not be absolute, because I don‚Äôt know how to rank Tolkein, who created a wold which was completely in line with the Catholic faith, though not meant to be seen allegorically, against Lewis, who wrote didactic tracts on faith with the slimmest metaphor.</p>
<p>Of course, there are plenty of non Christian fictions written by non Christians. As someone who is, however, I wonder about how it should be reflected in my writing. I don‚Äôt think that, at this phase of my life, at least, I‚Äôm called to be writing pure theology. Certainly I‚Äôm not well enough read in the theology or formed in my faith<a href="#fn085" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> to feel as though I have things that need to be said to the world of theologians.</p>
<p>However, I do also have a platform. As of this morning, I have almost twelve hundred followers on my webnovel, and my chapters are read an average of almost 4000 times. With an audience like that, I have to wonder if there‚Äôs something I can do to spread the Gospel, if only covertly. Certainly I don‚Äôt want to suddenly shift the tone of my book to something explicitly religious, for two reasons.</p>
<p>First, I don‚Äôt really love didactic Christian writing as a genre. There are books I‚Äôve read that I really enjoy, but I find that I tend to get too caught up in where the metaphor falls apart. I don‚Äôt feel confident enough in my ability to portray nuance to where I think that I could write something without leading people astray.</p>
<p>I also feel like didactic Christian writing tends to only stand when read with that intention.<a href="#fn086" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> That is,<a href="#fn087" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> while I feel like a work of art tends to stand on its own, even when divorced of its context, I find that a lot of didactic writing requires people to be seeking out a book that will lecture them in order to be enjoyable.</p>
<p>That leads to the second concern I have, which is that a blatantly Catholic piece of writing is not what the readers of my book have sought out. Now, there is an argument I respect that people do not always know what they want, but I don‚Äôt know if it really holds here. After all, there is almost no cost to people dropping my story if they do not like it, and I don‚Äôt know if the morals I‚Äôm espousing in the book are particularly non-Christian.</p>
<p>I guess that question is certainly one that I have. To what extent does a work I write become Christian and what are the important parts of a Christian fiction to me?<a href="#fn088" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> There‚Äôs something to be said for the idea that a Christian book can be as much about the worldview it espouses as any particular theological point.</p>
<p>In that regard, I think that my web novel is at least somewhat Christian in its view of the world. Violence is not something that the main character idolizes, and his family is filled with people who care deeply for each other. Man made institutions are ultimately fallible, but people by and large are good and motivated by a desire to see the world improve. Without adding a messianic character, I suppose that it‚Äôs hard to get too much more Christian, especially given that Christ is<a href="#fn089" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> central to the Christian faith.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt know if this musing did what I wanted it to. I think that I wanted to find a way to write in a way that I considered more Christian, despite never really having considered what that would look like. Instead, I think that I‚Äôm walking away from this posting with the idea that I should just be more intentional about the morals I‚Äôm espousing implicitly and explicitly in my writing. I don‚Äôt think that I‚Äôm good enough at writing or thinking to effectively weave in allegory yet, though that is something I should consider.<a href="#fn0810" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write 1700 words for NaNoWriMo? Yes! I did a writing session with a friend, and it was really fun. I think I ended up writing close to 2000 words in that hour, which is near what my maximum WPH has ever been.<a href="#fn0811" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>1726/1700. I continue<a href="#fn0812" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> to grow ahead of schedule.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb? I did! I finished it and sent it to my beta reader before finishing this post. Interestingly, the writing of the chapter was far easier than it felt yesterday. I guess there‚Äôs something to be said in consistency, especially in terms of making something which is not inherently difficult seem easier.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? I did! I thought about the post over the day, which was good, and wow we‚Äôre now on a three day streak! That‚Äôs super cool and I‚Äôm excited to continue it further.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? Unlike last night where I forgot, today I was too rushed before leaving home<a href="#fn0813" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>, and I wore dress clothes<a href="#fn0814" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>, so couldn‚Äôt really stretch during the day. As with last night, I am again going to stretch after posting this.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing better at prayer than a rushed and thoughtless rosary? I did an Angelus again today around noon, and I went to mass. I also went to mass last night, which I forget if I mentioned or not. I also tried to focus on the rosary last night, but did not do a great job.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing a good job writing letters to friends? I thought about one of the letters I want to write.<a href="#fn0815" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> I did not, however, write the letter or in any other demonstrable way make progress on my goal of writing more letters. I didn‚Äôt<a href="#fn0816" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> know if I would be able to today yesterday, though, so I‚Äôm ok with this.</p></li>

<p>First Published: 2023 November 1</p>

<p>Well, it‚Äôs another November, which means it‚Äôs time for another installment in ‚ÄúI<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> try my hardest to drive myself insane by doing something related to NaNoWriMo again.‚Äù In 2018, when I began this blog<a href="#fn092" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, I did not have the drive to actually write a novel. Instead, I <a href="nanowrimo.html">attempted to add fifty thousand words to my ‚Äôblog postings over the course of the month.</a> As I am sure you<a href="#fn093" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> can guess, I was unsuccessful at that mission.</p>
<p>By 2019, I had forgotten about my musings well before November rolled around. 2020 and 2021 likewise passed by me without anything to point at.<a href="#fn094" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> I suppose that there may not actually be all that much from 2021, given that I worked on the same journal from November of 2019<a href="#fn095" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> through August of last year.</p>
<p>Last year, as I certainly remember, I <a href="nanowrimo-2.html">attempted to do NaNoWriMo</a> for what I had a vague idea was my first time ever. As it turns out, I had made an account back in 2011, and had attempted to do NaNoWriMo that year. I, unsurprisingly, failed at that goal.</p>
<p>Last year, however, I was successful, at least in terms of writing 50000 words of fiction and finishing one narrative. The two did not align with each other, as I needed to start a sequel in order to get to the needed word count. Of course, I gave up on the story almost as soon as I could. One year later, I have no interest in revisiting that story.</p>
<p>I also wrote a story this past April, as part of a writing competition for the website where I currently post my ongoing novel.<a href="#fn096" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> I made it to the word count for that book<a href="#fn097" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>, but was tired of writing it by the end of the word count and rushed the ending.</p>
<p>Well, rushed may be a bit of an understatement. The book was set over the course of twelve years. I spent all but fifteen hundred of the words on the first three weeks, then rushed through the next twelve years in the remaining word count. One commenter‚Äôs reply was that they were grateful that I did not leave the work unfinished, for all that the ending was incredibly unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>So, that brings us to November. As I mentioned <a href="reflection-october-23.html">yesterday</a>, I am also trying to revive this ‚Äôblog and get further ahead in my other book at the same time. Will it work?</p>
<p>Who knows.</p>
<p>Will I burn out before the month is done?</p>
<p>Almost certainly.</p>
<p>Am I still going to ride this train for as long as I can, in hopes that I might be able to salvage a number of words from the situation?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Anyways, the book this year is something I‚Äôve never tried before. I realize I‚Äôve only really written third person limited in the past, so I‚Äôm writing this book in first person. Now, whether that‚Äôs going to be a good idea is yet to be determined.</p>
<p>The general plot of the book is that there‚Äôs an order of vampire fighting werewolf priests in the modern day United States.<a href="#fn098" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> I‚Äôm not sure how much of the balance I‚Äôll have between conversation and action, but given that I‚Äôve spent all of today‚Äôs content<a href="#fn099" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> on the main character getting ready to meet with the monastery, odds are good that this book will also end up somewhat rushed.</p>
<p>In any case, it‚Äôll be the book I try to write.s I‚Äôm hopeful that I can tell a story, and a story with faith, since I haven‚Äôt really touched my faith in any of the writing I‚Äôve done.<a href="#fn0910" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be able to do it to anyone‚Äôs satisfaction, let alone my own, but I have been thinking a fair amount about how to interface my faith and writing.</p>
<p>I feel like that topic deserves far more consideration than I can give it at this point in the night.<a href="#fn0911" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> It‚Äôs currently past my bedtime, and I‚Äôm well above my word goal for the day.<a href="#fn0912" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write 1700 words for NaNoWriMo? Yes! I did two fifteen minute sprints<a href="#fn0913" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>, 1798/1700. Nice I am 100 words ahead of schedule now.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb? I did! I just finished it, and, as seems always true, it felt much harder to write the chapter at the beginning<a href="#fn0914" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> than it ended up being.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? I am blogging now! Currently working on a streak, which is nice.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? Shoot! I will do that as soon as I finish here</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing better at prayer than a rushed and thoughtless rosary? I remembered to do an<a href="#fn0915" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> Angelus just before noon, when my alarm went off. Otherwise, I tried to be more mindful about my prayer last night, for all that I don‚Äôt know if it really was.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing a good job writing letters to friends? I found my stamps, envelopes, and cards. I also addressed an envelope. That feels like enough for the day, especially since I want to make the letters feel as easy as possible. Tomorrow I‚Äôll try to address another letter, but we‚Äôll see how I‚Äôm doing on time.</p></li>

<li id="fn096" role="doc-endnote"><p>the more I write, the more uncomfortable I get with ending sentences in prepositions. I know that there‚Äôs nothing inherently wrong with the prior sentence reading ‚Äúfor the website I currently post my ongoing novel on‚Äù, but the construction reads weirdly to me now.

<li id="fn098" role="doc-endnote"><p>well, in the modern day. I think that the plan is for the order to exist across the whole world, but the main character, and therefore, story, all will take place in the US.

<li id="fn0910" role="doc-endnote"><p>well, at least I haven‚Äôt touched on my faith intentionally in any of the fiction writing. The many reflections on the readings I‚Äôve done here aren‚Äôt counted, for obvious reasons. It‚Äôs also probably obvious that I have a Catholic world view given the other writing I‚Äôve done, but I am not the person to analyze that.<a href="#fn09ref10" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">‚Ü©Ô∏é</a></p></li>
