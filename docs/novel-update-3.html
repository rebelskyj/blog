<p>Do I feel guilty that I almost exclusively write about the other writing I do? A little bit.</p>
<p>Will that stop me? Not today apparently.</p>
<p>I’ve finally gotten far enough into the novel that I feel comfortable breaking into chapters. This is a bit of a double edged sword, though. I want my chapters to be around 1500-2500 words a piece. I also want to write around 2000 words a day. If your mind is going to the same place as mine, that means I’d be writing about 7 chapters a week.</p>
<p>That doesn’t feel sustainable for me, if only because only one author that I follow publishes at that pace. However, I feel like right now I’m able to keep it up, and it’s<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> always better to have more to revise from than less. I think I might try to use one day a week to edit, just so that everything flows well and the story arc works well, but who knows? Maybe I’ll just give up on the idea of a good story soon.</p>
