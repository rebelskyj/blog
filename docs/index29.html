<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>I couldn’t think of anything to write today. But, I was listening to a lot of music today, so I thought I’d try to make a mixtape. The theme is inspiration, specifically academic inspiration.</p>
<p>Front Side:<br />
Anthem by Harry Chapin<br />
Anything I’m Not by Lenka<br />
Corner of the Sky from the Pippin (New Broadway Cast Recording)<br />
Country Dreams by Harry Chapin<br />
Cover of the Rolling Stone by Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show<br />
Dammit Janet by the Rocky Horror Cast<br />
Dancing Queen by ABBA<br />
Don’t Stop Believing by Journey</p>
<p>Back Side:<br />
Grey Seal by Elton John<br />
A Hard Day’s Night by the Beatles<br />
Heartbeat (It’s a Love Beat) by the DeFranco Family<br />
How Far I’ll Go from Moana<br />
It’s Still Rock And Roll To Me by Billy Joel<br />
Kelly the Boy from Killane by the High Kings<br />
Livin’ On A Prayer by Bon Jovi<br />
Long Goodbye by the Nadas<br />
Mo Ghile Mear by Celtic Thunder</p>
<p>Explanation: Like Chapin’s protagonist, who’s “looking for an anthem”, I start by searching for motivation to start a paper. But, within seconds of writing a paper, I realize that it’s hard to be “Anything I’m Not”, and I’m hoinh to procrastinate. I’ll go find my “Corner of the Sky” to hang out at until I have the motivation to work. While in the “Country(,) Dreams” of avoiding responsibility come into my head. But, if I want to make it “On the Cover of the Rolling Stone”, I’ll need to get to work, and “Dammit Janet”<a href="#fn001" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I can’t think of anything. I just want to be “Dancing (to) Queen”, not writing this paper. But I know that if I “Don’t stop Believing” and write this paper, I might have time to go out.</p>
<p>I can’t really work “Grey Seal” in here, but it’s a good next song. As I look at the clock, unsure of whether the 6 is an AM or PM, I realize it’s been “A Hard Day’s Night”. And, as the deadline approaches, our heart may start pumping out of control. But, if we remember that “Heartbeat (It’s a Love Beat)” you can tell yourself that it’s not panic, it’s love of the topic.</p>
<p>As the paper continues, I often wonder “How Far I’ll Go” in trying to finish the paper. What’s the tenuous connection I hope the professor won’t latch on to.</p>
<p>Each paper and assignment is still somehow different from the one before. But, as Billy Joel points out, “It’s Still Rock And Roll To Me”. Every work is different, but the same in principle.</p>
<p>“Kelly the Boy from Killane” is just a bop.</p>
<p>As I’ve mentioned a lot so far, as a deadline draws near, students often feel nervous, like they’re “Living On A Prayer”. And, as we look at the work we have left in the semester, and the time left to do it, we may have to say a “Long Goodbye” to our friends until the work we all have is resolved.</p>
<p>But, we have hope that we’ll make it through. “Mo Ghile Mear” is a song of hope, so it seems fitting to end the list.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As I’ve mentioned in many other posts, I like music. So, I decided that I would make a mix tape today. Cassette tapes apparently hold 60-90 minutes of music, so that seems like a good length to shoot for. I’ll assume 30 minutes per side, since I’m feeling unambitious.</p>
<p>Next I need a theme. I think today’s theme will be inspiration. It’s the point in the semester where it seems that inspiration is needed.<a href="#fn002" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Of course, inspiration comes in a variety of places. So, I’ll start with “Anthem” by Harry Chapin.<a href="#fn003" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> I’ll follow it with Lenka’s “Anything I’m Not”.<a href="#fn004" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> <a href="#fn005" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Next is “Corner of the Sky” from the Pippin (New Broadway Cast Recording) <a href="#fn006" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Following that will be “Country Dreams” by Harry Chapin.<a href="#fn007" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#fn008" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Next: “Cover of the Rolling Stone” by Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show.<a href="#fn009" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> After this: “Dammit Janet” by the Rocky Horror Cast.<a href="#fn0010" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Of course, I would be remiss if I didn’t throw some ABBA in, so next is Dancing Queen.<a href="#fn0011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#fn0012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Continuing the theme of powerpop from older generations’ childhoods, “Don’t Stop Believing” by Journey.<a href="#fn0013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Backside: “Grey Seal” by Elton John.<a href="#fn0014" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> It was so tempting to put another Harry Chapin song here,<a href="#fn0015" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> but instead, “A Hard Day’s Night” by the Beatles.<a href="#fn0016" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> And: “Heartbeat (It’s a Love Beat)” by the DeFranco Family.<a href="#fn0017" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> Following that, “How Far I’ll Go” from Moana.<a href="#fn0018" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> Next: since I realize I’m missing Billy Joel, “It’s Still Rock And Roll To Me”.<a href="#fn0019" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> “Kelly The Boy from Killane” as performed by the High Kings follows this.<a href="#fn0020" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> Returning to nostalgia I have no right to have, “Livin’ On A Prayer” by Bon Jovi.<a href="#fn0021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> And, following that, a song by an Iowa group<sup>,</sup>footnote<span>yay!</span> “Long Goodbye” by the Nadas.<a href="#fn0022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> Finishing off the playlist, “Mo Ghile Mear” as performed by Celtic Thunder.<a href="#fn0023" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Time to give the playlist a<a href="#fn0024" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> listen, then revise/add comments. To begin: I started with Harry Chapin’s “Anthem,” because it has a strong driving beat, which helps focus, and it has lyrics that I appreciate. Also, the background instrumentation feels much sparser than most of his songs, which I appreciate.</p>
<p>Anything I’m Not follows, as it too has a strong pulse. Unlike Chapin, Lenka has<a href="#fn0025" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> a much more cheerful outlook. The song ends with an idea of escaping, and becoming free, which fits in so well with the next song.</p>
<p>Corner of the Sky is my favorite Pippin song, and one of my favorite musical theatre songs. Like many graduates of my high school, I have fond memories of watching our choir director sing this song at our senior choir concert. The song helps keep me focused when I really need to get work done.<a href="#fn0026" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> It speaks about finding where you belong, which the next Chapin song, “Country Dreams” does as well.</p>
<p>Unlike in the Pippin song, Chapin fully accepts that he’s given up on his dreams. But, he’s accepted that, and still keeps on trucking. Especially as deadlines approach, knowing that you’ve got something, even if it’s not what you want, is all you can sometimes ask for.</p>
<p>But, we still dream big, and so to do Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show’s in “Cover of the Rolling Stone”. Of course, once you’re at the top, there’s always something that can go wrong. A car could break down outside of a house, and you might need to go into a creepy house to get your way back to civilization.</p>
<p>Of course, that’s nonsense, but “Dammit Janet” from Rocky Horror Picture Show has the strong beat that we appreciated in the first songs, and speaks of Brad’s<a href="#fn0027" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> goal to achieve.</p>
<p>Next, “Dancing Queen” by ABBA starts with the line that students dream of during studies.<a href="#fn0028" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> After 20 minutes of concentration, I need something to lighten my spirits.</p>
<p>Of course, the next song, “Don’t Stop Believing” speaks to me every time I know I don’t have enough time to finish an assignment. Somehow, I’ll make it through. And there ends the front side.</p>
<p>In the time it takes me to switch our metaphorical cassette tape over,<a href="#fn0029" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> I need a quick and lively introduction. Elton John’s “Grey Seal” gives that to me. Then, since homework is still continuing, “A Hard Day’s Night” goes through my head when I’ve been inside a building working on an assignment, and am not sure which 6 the clock is pointing to.<a href="#fn0030" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> And, as the deadline approaches, our heart may start pumping out of control. But, if we remember that “Heartbeat (It’s a Love Beat)” you can tell yourself that it’s not panic, it’s love of the topic.</p>
<p>As the paper continues, I often wonder “How Far I’ll Go” in trying to finish the paper. What’s the tenuous connection I hope the professor won’t latch on to.</p>
<p>Each paper and assignment is still somehow different from the one before. But, as Billy Joel points out, “It’s Still Rock And Roll To Me”. Every work is different, but the same in principle.</p>
<p>There’s nothing special about “Kelly the Boy from Killane”, it’s just a motivational song.</p>
<p>As I’ve mentioned a lot so far, as a deadline draws near, students often feel nervous, like they’re “Living On A Prayer”. And, as we look at the work we have left in the semester, and the time left to do it, we may have to say a “Long Goodbye” to our friends until the work we all have is resolved. And, like any good playlist, it ends with hope. Specifically, hope that someone will come set us free. Here, “Mo Ghile Mear” stands in nicely.</p>

<p>Prereading note: this post was written as an assignment, so drafts 4-6<a href="#fn041" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> lack much of my snark and<a href="#fn042" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> will read much more like an academic essay.

<p>Diaries today are becoming more and more of a digital phenomenon. That is, people are deciding to record their thoughts on computers, rather than paper. This transition from analog to digital is not wholly uncontroversial.</p>
<p>Many people have a distrust of digital diary keeping. However, their objections almost always orient around the alleged fragility of digital diaries.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with the Internet, online storage can seem horribly fragile. Unlike a bound book, which can last indefinitely,<a href="#fn044" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> digital diaries require constant upkeep. If written in a word processor, a blog<a href="#fn045" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> post could become unreadable if the file format becomes obsolete or unused.<a href="#fn046" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> But, most blogs are, as the name suggests, hosted on the Internet.</p>
<p>A second concern is that posts on the web may be pulled down or somehow become unavailable.<a href="#fn047" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> The fact that two different agencies,<a href="#fn048" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> both make constant backups of the Internet is seen as a lackluster response.<a href="#fn049" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> And, unlike physical diaries, anyone can access any blog from anywhere and anytime, which frees the researcher from needing the funds to go to the specific library where a diary is held, or find a way to have a copy made.

<p>Since these backups exist so widely, it is far less likely that we will undergo a similar loss to the burning of the Library of Alexandria or the burning of the linguistic library in Brazil.<a href="#fn0410" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Had the files in the library been digital, they would have been hosted in a different site from the physical artifacts, preventing that horrible loss of knowledge.</p>
<p>That tragedy calls out the most important problem with preferring physical media over digital media. Yes, you can duplicate a physical document. If you don’t care about the exactness of the replicated document,<a href="#fn0411" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> it is a fairly trivial process<a href="#fn0412" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> to transcribe a backup.<a href="#fn0413" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> But, as the recent burning of the Brazilian library shows, even vitally important documents aren’t always backed up.<a href="#fn0414" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> The Internet, however, backs up everything.</p>
<p>And to me, the heart of digital diary and the Internet is reflected by this fact: neither promises permanence, only equality.

Therefore, to me, the arguments against online diaries, especially now, some 20 years after the first published arguments, are nothing except baseless fear of the future.</p>

<p>Diaries are becoming a digital phenomenon. That is, people are deciding to record their thoughts on computers, rather than paper. This transition from analog to digital is not wholly uncontroversial.</p>
<p>Many people have a distrust of digital diary keeping. However, their objections almost always orient around the alleged fragility of digital diaries.<a href="#fn0416" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with the Internet, online storage can seem horribly fragile. Unlike a bound book, which can last indefinitely, digital diaries require constant upkeep.

<p>A second concern is that posts on the web may be pulled down or somehow become unavailable. The fact that two different agencies,<a href="#fn0418" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> both make constant backups of the Internet is seen as a lackluster response. O’Sullivan complains that “the Wayback Machine does not have word or subject search capabilities,”<a href="#fn0419" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>, which would hold merit if not for the fact that physical diaries and libraries also lack subject search without the work of dedicated stewards. Additionally, blogs all have word search capabilities, as modern browsers contain that feature.

<p>Diaries today are becoming more of a digital phenomenon. That is, more and more people decide to record their thoughts on digital displays, rather than analog records. However, this transition from analog to digital is not wholly uncontroversial.</p>
<p>Many people have a distrust of digital diary keeping. But, examination of these objections tends to show that they are rooted in either classism or appeals to tradition. They almost always find themselves orienting around the alleged fragility of digital diaries.<a href="#fn0421" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>And, for those unfamiliar with the Internet, online storage can seem horribly fragile. Unlike a bound book, which can last indefinitely, digital diaries require constant upkeep. If written in a word processor a blog<a href="#fn0422" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> post could plausibly become unreadable if the file format becomes obsolete or unused. But, most blogs are, as the name suggests, hosted on the Internet.</p>
<p>A second concern is that posts on the web may be pulled down or somehow also become unavailable. The fact that the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine<a href="#fn0423" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> or Google’s own caching system both make constant backups is seen as lackluster. O’Sullivan complains that “the Wayback Machine does not have word or subject search capabilities,”<a href="#fn0424" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>, which would hold merit if not for the fact that physical diaries and libraries also lack subject search without the work of dedicated stewards..

<p>Thirdly, since these backups are spread over many different servers, it is far less likely that we will undergo a similar loss to the burning of the Library of Alexandria or even the very recent burning of the linguistic library in Brazil.<a href="#fn0425" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> Had the files in the library been digital, they could have been more easily duplicated, and would have been hosted in a different site from the physical artifacts, preventing that horrible loss of knowledge.</p>
<p>That tragedy calls out the most important problem with preferring physical media over digital media. Yes, you can duplicate a physical document. If you don’t care about the exactness of the replicated document, it is a fairly trivial process to transcribe a backup. But, as the recent burning of the Brazilian library shows, even vitally important documents aren’t always backed up.</p>
<p>The Internet, however, backs up everything. Yes, we may not have a guarantee that this generation’s Beowulf will survive if not printed. However, even many of the manuscripts from that time are still gone.</p>
<p>And to me, the heart of digital diary and the Internet is reflected by this: they don’t promise permanence, only equality.

<h1 id="draft-4">Draft 4</h1>
<p>Diaries, like many written records, are becoming more and more of a digital phenomenon. That is, more and more people decide to record their thoughts on digital displays, rather than analog records. And, like the other forms becoming digital, the transition from analog to digital is not wholly uncontroversial.</p>
<p>For many reasons, people have a distrust of digital diary keeping. But, even a mild examination of most of these objections shows that they are deeply rooted in either classist thoughts or appeals to tradition. They almost always find themselves orienting around the alleged fragility of digital diaries, regardless of the factuality of these claims.<a href="#fn0426" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with the Internet, online storage can seem horribly fragile. Unlike a bound book, which can last indefinitely, digital diaries require constant upkeep. If written in a word processor, for instance, a blog<a href="#fn0427" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> post could plausibly become unreadable if the file format becomes obsolete or unused. However, since nearly old computers are still functional, and old operating systems are constantly being ported to new machines, it is unlikely that we will ever have files that we truly cannot open. They may be difficult to interpret, but no more so than damaged manuscripts.</p>
<p>A second concern is that posts on the web may be pulled down or somehow also become unavailable. The obvious rebuttal to this statement, namely the Internet Archive<a href="#fn0428" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> or Google’s own caching system is seen as lackluster. O’Sullivan complains that “the Wayback Machine (the Internet Archive) does not have word or subject search capabilities.”footnote<span>Diaries, On-Line Diaries, and the Future Loss to Archives; Or, Blogs and the Blogging Bloggers who Blog Them. C. O’Sullivan p.71</span> That argument would hold merit if not for the fact that physical diaries lack search capabilities, and libraries holding them do as well. What searching methods are available come only when dedicated people add them.</p>
<p>However, the lack of searching capabilities is never seen as a flaw in traditional diaries. Unlike physical diaries, anyone can access any blog from anywhere and anytime, which frees the researcher from needing the funds to go to the specific library where a diary is held, or find a way to have a copy made. They can also search, since every modern web browser has search and find capabilities.</p>
<p>Additionally, since these files are spread over many different servers, it is far less likely that we will undergo a similar loss to the burning of the Library of Alexandria or even the very recent burning of the linguistic library in Brazil.<a href="#fn0429" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> Had the files in the library been digital, they could have been more easily duplicated, and would have been hosted in a different site from the physical artifacts, preventing that horrible loss of knowledge.</p>
<p>That tragedy leads to the third problem with preferring physical media over digital media. Yes, you can duplicate a physical document. If you don’t care about the exactness of the replicated document, it is a fairly trivial process to transcribe a backup. But, as the recent burning of the Brazilian library shows, even vitally important documents aren’t always backed up. What guarantee does a random, insignificant citizen of the world have that anything they write will ever be relevant to historians?</p>
<p>The most honest answer is that they don’t. Most likely nothing any given blogger has to say won’t be relevant. Nonetheless, the Internet protects and safeguards it. Yes, it is true that we may not have a guarantee that this generation’s Beowulf will survive if not printed. However, even many of the manuscripts from that time are still gone. The Internet makes it more likely that the unimportant words will live on.</p>
<p>And to me, that truly is the heart of digital diary keeping, and by extension, the internet. They doesn’t promise permanence, only equality. Every work hosted on Wordpress, for instance, is just as likely to be there in fifty year’s time.<a href="#fn0430" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> The famous and forgotten will both exist in perpetuity. Therefore, to me, the arguments against online diaries, especially 15 years after the publishing of O’Sullivan’s article, are nothing except baseless fear of the future.</p>
<h1 id="draft-3">Draft 3</h1>
<p>Diaries, like many written records, are becoming more and more of a digital phenomenon. That is, more and more people<a href="#fn0431" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> are turning, not to their notebooks, but to their keyboards when they decide to put to paper<a href="#fn0432" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> what’s in their mind. And, like these other records, the transition from analog to digital is not wholly uncontroversial.</p>
<p>For many reasons, people have a distrust of digital diary keeping. But, even a mild examination of most of these objections shows that they are deeply rooted in either classist thoughts or appeals to tradition. They almost always find themselves orienting around the alleged fragility of digital diaries, regardless of the factuality of these claims.<a href="#fn0433" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with the Internet,<a href="#fn0434" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> online storage can seem horribly fragile.

Unlike the physical diaries, however, we can access<a href="#fn0443" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> any blog from anywhere and anytime,<a href="#fn0444" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a> which frees the researcher from needing the funds to go to the specific library where a diary is held, or find a way to have a copy made.</p>
<p>Additionally, since these files are spread over many different servers, it is far less likely that we will undergo a similar loss to the burning of the Library of Alexandria<a href="#fn0445" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> or even the very recent burning of the linguistic library in South America.<a href="#fn0446" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a> Had the files been digital, they could have been more easily duplicated, and would have been hosted in a different site from the physical artifacts.<a href="#fn0447" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>That leads to the third problem with preferring physical media over digital media. Yes, you can duplicate a physical document. If you don’t care about the exactness of the replicated document,<a href="#fn0448" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a> it is a fairly trivial process to transcribe a backup.<a href="#fn0449" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref49" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a> But, as the recent burning of the Brazilian library shows, even vitally important documents aren’t always backed up. What guarantee does a random, insignificant citizen of the world have that anything they write will ever be relevant to historians?</p>
<p>The fairest answer is that they don’t. Most likely they won’t be relevant. Nonetheless, the internet protects and safeguards it. Yes, it is true that we may not have a guarantee that this generation’s Beowulf will survive if not printed.<a href="#fn0450" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref50" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#fn0451" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a> But, we have a much higher chance that any thought of a random individual will be as accessible to future generations as that epic.</p>
<p>And to me, that truly is the heart of digital diary keeping, and by extension, the internet. They doesn’t promise permanence, only equality. Every work hosted on Wordpress is just as likely to be there in fifty year’s time.<a href="#fn0452" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a> The famous and forgotten will both exist in perpetuity. To me, the arguments against online diaries, especially 15 years after the publishing of O’Sullivan’s article, are nothing except baseless fear of the future.</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>Diaries, like many written records, are becoming more and more of a digital phenomenon. And, like these other records, the transition is not wholly uncontroversial. For many reasons, people have a distrust of digital diary keeping. However, these objections are almost always classist, unreasonable, or Ludditical. They almost always find themselves orienting around the alleged fragility of digital diaries, regardless of the factuality of these claims.<a href="#fn0453" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with the digital world, online storage can seem horribly fragile. Unlike a bound book, which can last indefinitely,<a href="#fn0454" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a> digital diaries require constant upkeep. If written in a word processor, for instance,<a href="#fn0455" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref55" role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a> the blog post may can hypothetically become unreadable if the file format becomes obsolete or unused. However, since every currently obsolete file storage<a href="#fn0456" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref56" role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a> currently has an interpreter, it is unlikely that we will ever have files that we truly cannot open.</p>
<p>A second concern is that posts on the web<a href="#fn0457" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref57" role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a> may be pulled down or somehow also become unavailable. The simple rebuttal of the Internet Archive<a href="#fn0458" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref58" role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a> or Google’s own caching system is seen as lackluster. O’Sullivan complains that “the Wayback Machine does not have word or subject search capabilities.”<a href="#fn0459" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref59" role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a> That argument would hold merit if not for the fact that physical diaries lack search capabilities, and libraries holding them do as well. Regardless of the search capabilities, the files still exist. Unlike the physical diaries, we can access all of the blogs from anywhere with an internet connection, which frees the researcher from having to find the funds to go to a library where a diary comes from.</p>
<p>Additionally, since these files are spread over many different servers, it is far less likely that we will undergo a similar loss to the burning of the Library of Alexandria<a href="#fn0460" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref60" role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a> or even the very recent burning of the linguistic library in South America.<a href="#fn0461" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref61" role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a> Had the files been wholly digital, they could have been more easily duplicated, and would have been hosted in a different site from the physical artifacts.</p>
<p>That leads to the third problem with physical over digital media. Yes, you can duplicate a physical document. If you don’t care about the exact document,<a href="#fn0462" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref62" role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a> it is a fairly trivial process to transcribe a backup.<a href="#fn0463" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref63" role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a> But, as the recent burning of the library shows, even drastically important documents aren’t always backed up. What guarantee does a random, insignificant citizen of the world have that anything they write will ever be relevant to historians? The short and long answer is they don’t. Most likely they won’t be relevant.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the internet protects and safeguards it. Yes, we may not have as good of a guarantee of this generation’s Beowulf surviving on parchment if it isn’t printed out.<a href="#fn0464" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref64" role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a> But, we have a much higher chance that the random thoughts of a random individual will be as accessible to future generations as that epic.</p>

And that, along with the different archiving methods, brings to the next point. This is the first time in human history where we can not only see what was written, but pinpoint to the exact second when a piece is written, edited, or deleted. Diary studiers point to the spread of the clock as a phenomenon leading to the rise of the diary and see this as a good change, and yet don’t feel the same way about the rise of digital media. To me, this is, especially 15 years after the publishing of O’Sullivan’s article, nothing except baseless fear of the future.</p>

<h1 id="othello-review"><a href="othello.html">Othello Review</a></h1>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Tonight I had the pleasure of watching Othello at the Globe Theatre. In a wonderful turn of events, I was a groundling.<a href="#fn051" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I was right next to the stage, and even leaning on it for the piece of the play after intermission.</p>
<p>Sadly, the set and lighting didn’t blow me away. The lights were fixed and immobile, and the set more or less was as well. What I can comment on, however, was the music.</p>
<p>The show began with natural trumpets,<a href="#fn052" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> which was nice. Come the scene where Cassio becomes drunk, they are replaced with valved trumpets. Before the first intermission, they bring out the cornetti,</p>
<p>In the second act, the cornetti play lamentations as the piece falls to its tragic fate. The ending dance, however, returns with the beautiful jazz trumpeting. Other instruments included a lute during the drunk scene, played masterfully by Iago, drums and other percussion played by instrumentalists, and whistles.</p>
<p>Finally, as is requested by Shakespeare, there is singing. The drunken songs sounded drunk and merry. The whole cast song at the end was sung brilliantly.<a href="#fn053" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> But, the song that struck me hardest was Desdemona and Emilia’s duet of the Willow Tree. They flowed between two part harmony and unisons flawlessly and beautifully. I stood entranced for the first<a href="#fn054" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> time in the show. Nothing existed for me except the two flowing voices and the story they told.</p>
<p>And truly, that’s all that I can ask of a show. There was a moment where time stood still, and I found myself drawn, not into the story or characters, but simply into a place where I feel what the characters feel. Even in professional theatre, those moments can be hard to come by, but the cast brought me nearly to that point time and time again, and to the point in the soulful duet. But, as all good things do,<a href="#fn055" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> it too came to an end.</p>

<h1 id="draft-3">Draft 3</h1>
<p>Today’s Gospel<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> reading features one of the two lines that I find most striking in the Gospels.<a href="#fn062" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Jesus exhorts Peter, “Get behind me, Satan!”<a href="#fn063" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Peter, the man who<a href="#fn064" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Jesus loved and trusted so much so that he entrusted the Church to him, is called Satan.<a href="#fn065" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> To me, this truly shows two of the important pieces of my Catholic faith: we are to act and speak as we see true, not always meekly or gently, and that we are to love the sinner and hate the sin. Jesus doesn’t reproach Peter in soft words, or calmly. In fact, he doesn’t even do it kindly. In no uncertain words, he tells Peter that he is sinning.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, 6 days later, he takes Peter to the mountain where he meets with Elijah and Moses.<a href="#fn066" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Even though the Gospels don’t mention it, clearly Jesus forgave Peter for his actions, and Peter tried to accept this change.</p>
<p>This reading particularly speaks to me in today’s climate. We tend to take neither of the two messages we are told to take. We don’t tell the people we love to their faces that what they are doing is wrong.<a href="#fn067" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> We also don’t do the other side of the message, and forgive those who do wrong. I’m as guilty of this as anyone. I judge quickly and quietly, then discount anything that someone who has spoken out of ignorance has to say. Today’s reading was a good reminder to me that I need to try harder to love, even when it’s hard.</p>

To me, this truly shows two of the important pieces of my Catholic faith: we are to act and speak as we see true, not as we see convenient, and that we are to love the sinner and hate the sin. Jesus doesn’t reproach Peter in soft words, or calmly.

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today’s Gospel reading features one of the two lines that I find most striking in the Gospels. Jesus exhorts Peter, “Get behind me, Satan!”<a href="#fn0614" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Peter, the man who<a href="#fn0615" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> loved and trusted so much so that he entrusted the Church to him, is called Satan. This is truly the best example of Jesus saying that we are to love the sinner, even if we abhor the sin. Moreso, it points out to me that we have the responsibility to help those around us who make mistakes. 6 days later, he takes Peter to the mountain where he meets with Elijah and Moses.<a href="#fn0616" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> Even though the Gospels don’t mention it, clearly there was some conversation during those 6 days where the misunderstanding was resolved.</p>

<h1 id="sleep-days"><a href="sleepy-days.html">Sleep Days</a></h1>
<p>Some days you go to sleep, anxiously awaiting the coming morning and day. Other days you wake up, counting down the moments until you can go back to sleep.</p>
<p>There are many factors that can influence both of those, from what’s happening in your life at a macro scale,<a href="#fn071" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> at a micro scale,<a href="#fn072" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, and how much sleep you’ve gotten the night<a href="#fn073" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> before.</p>
<p>Today I remembered that sleep you miss is at least as important as the other two. I didn’t sleep enough, and so today wasn’t as fully experienced as it could be. I’m hoping tomorrow will be better.</p>

<h1 id="playing-the-ukulele"><a href="playing-the-ukulele.html">Playing the Ukulele</a></h1>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As you many have gathered from my <a href="http://j.rebelsky.com/pierogi-recipe.html">prior post</a>, I play the ukulele.<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> There are two reasons I thought it important to bring with me on my trip to London. First, it’s the smallest instrument I know<a href="#fn082" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> that can play chords and harmony, which is nice when I want to sing along with a backing.</p>
<p>The other reason is that I have minimal difficulty playing melodies on it. Whether I’m plucking out an old familiar melody to decide how to accompany it, playing along to my singing new melodies, or picking out new melodies, I can do them all with relative ease. Part of this is that the instrument is tuned to four of five pentatonic notes<a href="#fn083" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> as its four strings. This also means when I want to play something with the dominant as the low note, it’s fairly easy to do, as the pentatonic scale a fourth below C still uses 4 of the 5 notes. The only difference is F instead of E.</p>
<p>All in all, the ukulele is a fun and easy instrument. I would highly recommend anyone to learn it.</p>

<h1 id="arranging-for-bagpipes-part-2"><a href="arranging-for-bagpipes-ii.html">Arranging for Bagpipes Part 2</a> </h1>
<p>As you may remember from my last mention of this topic, some songs are very difficult to arrange for bagpipe. Today, I was lucky enough to find a song that was easy.</p>
<p>I found myself today with the best problem an artist can have: a hyper focused muse. I could not focus on anything else until I had set the hymn “How Can I Keep From Singing” to bagpipes. Unlike the anthem that I previously discussed, this son was far easier. It’s pentatonic,<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and only occupies an octave, from the dominant to the dominant. As you may remember, the bagpipe has a range of an octave and a second starting from the subdominant. So, I put the song in the key of d, added a few grace notes, and was done. It’s nice when things go well.</p>
