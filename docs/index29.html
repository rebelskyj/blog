<p>As <a href="will-he-or-wont-he.html">I mentioned a while ago</a>, I‚Äôve been meaning to go to the London Uillean Piper‚Äôs club. I finally made it.</p>
<p>It was really fun, and I‚Äôm glad I went once, if only for the chance to try the instrument. However, since I didn‚Äôt get back until nearly 12:15 in the morning, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to be something I go to again. But, I‚Äôm glad I had the chance to try it once</p>

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>One of the things I tend to forget is that I have somewhat of a fear of heights. More than that, I have a fear of jumping off tall heights. Maybe that isn‚Äôt a fear, the more that I think about it, and just a reasonable reaction.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, since I was never afraid of one meter, seldom of three, and not at all afraid of jumping off of five meter platforms, I decided that I would try jumping off of the 10 meter platform tonight. I got to the 7 meter, and began climbing up to the 10.</p>
<p>I didn‚Äôt realize how close to the roof I was, especially since it seemed so high before I started. Wow that was scary.</p>
<p>But, I jumped. I was in the air way too long. And then I hit the water. Next week I‚Äôll try going in head first.</p>

<p>As most of you alleged readers know, I have somewhat bad vision. And, since we live in the future, we have wearable technology that corrects for that. Most of the time, I correct my vision with glasses. On occasion, I correct it with contacts. And then there are the nights like tonight.</p>
<p>While going about my day, I paused in my room to do some homework.<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Upon preparing to leave the dorm for a talk about maps that shaped America,<a href="#fn022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> I realized I couldn‚Äôt find my glasses. So, knowing that I knew how to get to the talk fine without seeing detail, I set off.</p>
<p>London is a much different city with poor vision. Crowds of people, who normally I didn‚Äôt register, suddenly seemed so much more sinister. My own shadow, distorted by street lights, gave me pause, as I thought I had a pursuer.</p>
<p>But, I made it to the talk safe, oddly enough. Today was nice, if only to remind myself both how blessed I am to have correctable vision, and how even the smallest of changes can drastically affect how we see the world.</p>

<p>Tonight, I had the lovely fortune of seeing George Furth and Steven Sondheim‚Äôs <em>Company</em> performed at the Gielgud Theatre. It was a show where the main character‚Äôs sex was flipped. No longer about Bobby, this show was about Bobbi.</p>
<p>It was incredibly enjoyable. The set mostly took the form of small, modular pieces which were surrounded by neon lights. They moved back and forth and up and down stage, and in some instances even up and down vertically. The music was beautiful, as is to be expected.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the orchestra was above the actors, rather than in a pit. The actors and actresses all performed brilliantly.</p>
<p>As to the production itself, for most of the show I‚Äôm unsure how different it was from the original script. I went in mostly blind, as I do for most musicals. However, I had seen a recording of the song ‚ÄúBarcelona.‚Äù</p>
<p>In this version, where the main character sleeps with a man, rather than the original which had the genders switched, there were some differences in how I felt as an audience member. Despite the fact that the staging seemed almost identical, it‚Äôs interesting how different some of the lines and blocking felt when delivered from a person of the opposite sex.</p>
<p>Overall, it was very enjoyable</p>

<p>Mark 12:44-44 ‚Äú A poor widow also came and put in two small coins worth a few cents. Calling his disciples to himself, he said to them, ‚ÄòAmen, I say to you, this poor widow put in more than all the other contributors to the treasury. For they have all contributed from their surplus wealth, but she, from her poverty, has contributed all she had, her whole livelihood.‚Äô‚Äù</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today‚Äôs Gospel gives the message that I‚Äôve always had the hardest part reconciling with the teachings we see in daily religious life. The Lord says that the widow‚Äôs gift, though small, means the most, as she has the least to give.</p>
<p>As a Catholic, I am taught that faith is a call to action. The sentiment that ‚Äúfaith without action is dead‚Äù is not an uncommon one. So, why is it that we see good deeds done by the faithless as anything but the miracles that they are?</p>
<p>When a faithful person performs a good deed, it shouldn‚Äôt be remarkable. They are simply doing what their soul tells them to do. When they make the choice to not do good, it takes an effort. But, someone who doesn‚Äôt believe doesn‚Äôt have that call. For those without faith, if we believe that faith is what calls you to action, there is no call to do good.</p>
<p>And yet, the faithless still do good. To me, that‚Äôs the most beautiful part of life</p>

<p>Assuming anyone actaully reads my daily posts, they might have noticed that yesterday, for the first time in more than 70 days, I didn‚Äôt update. In a way, it was sort of a relief. I knew that at some point, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to update every day, so getting it out of the way was a relief. I had visited Belgium to see a friend, and didn‚Äôt find the time to make a post. I also didn‚Äôt write for NaNoWriMo, but since I was well ahead of schedule,<a href="#fn051" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I‚Äôm not too worried.

<p>I‚Äôm unsure which I‚Äôll do</p>

<p>Today is Friday. It‚Äôs also the Friday ending what my host university calls ‚ÄúReading Week.‚Äù As class ended last week, my professor made a note of that, before commenting that little to no reading happens during reading week.</p>
<p>I planned on reading during reading week. But, Monday turned into Tuesday turned into today, and I did no studying. Somehow, I even read less of my pleasure reading than I tend to do. But, I did destress, which is important, since I didn‚Äôt realize how ragged I‚Äôd been running myself. So, I guess I read the right amount?</p>

<p>As I mentioned <a href="nanowrimo.html">earlier</a>, I‚Äôm doin NaNoWriMo this year. But, I‚Äôm also competitive with myself. So, around four days in, I figured out how I‚Äôd challenge myself. Each day, I‚Äôll not only write more,<a href="#fn071" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> but also increase the rate with which I‚Äôm writing more. Since I didn‚Äôt think ahead, that means that each day I need to write more than 3% more than I did the day before. So, by the end of the month, I‚Äôll have around five thousand words to write a day.</p>
<p>On the bright side, if I can do it, I‚Äôll have certainly made papers in the future much easier.</p>

<p>As I mentioned <a href="feeling-lucky.html">earlier</a>, I saw the <em>Book of Mormon</em> a little bit ago. It was a fun show, and somewhat interesting.</p>
<p>I already knew the main storyline, plot, and music, because I live a life in proximity to musical theatre. Sadly, I remember only a few bits from the actual production.<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>First, it was interesting that, other than Jesus, who had what I think was meant to be a California Surfer accent, all of the characters spoke with East Coast accents. Second, I didn‚Äôt realize how explicit the innuendo was in ‚ÄúBaptize Me.‚Äù Finally, the characters were almost over the top in how stereotypically American they sounded and acted at times. It was an interesting reminder that America is viewed differently from the outside looking in as from the inside looking in. Overall, however, it was a wonderful production. The cast and crew did a great job.</p>

<p>Tonight I had the wonderful opportunity to see <em>La Bayadere</em> at the Royal Opera House.<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> It was odd.</p>
<p>Apparently in ballet, unlike theatre, you‚Äôre supposed to read what‚Äôs going to happen ahead of time. I did not. I was confused.</p>
<p>I did like the second act, though. There were a couple of dances with the whole chorus that were super fun and made nice lines and shapes.</p>
<p>Overall, while not a fan of opera, at least I have another piece in the music to theatrical story spectrum. It begins with symphony, then sound painting, then ballet, opera, musical, then non musical theatre. Yay.</p>
