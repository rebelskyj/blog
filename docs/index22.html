<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Yesterday was my grandmother‚Äôs birthday. It‚Äôs a strange day for me, because it is a little sad. I still miss her, if only intellectually.</p>
<p>On the other hand, though, I can no longer remember most of what used to make me sad about her absence, let alone her. The only pieces of her voice that I can recall are from the voicemail that my dear brother had<a href="#fn001" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> for the longest time. When I try to picture her face, I can only see the photographs of her that we keep in our home.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs strange for me to realize that I‚Äôve been without grandparents for nearly half my life now. A lot of the poems I‚Äôve been writing this month have centered around memory, especially the generational memory that I feel like I‚Äôm missing.<a href="#fn002" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> In retrospect, November is a month that always has so many calls to my past, so it‚Äôs unsurprising that my reflection<a href="#fn003" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> would start centering on them.</p>
<p>So what is remembering? Is it the emotional ties that we keep to what‚Äôs now gone? Is it the intellectual knowledge of something now lost? Is it something else? I don‚Äôt really know, but I‚Äôm glad I at least had this to reflect on it for a bit.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs officially one week into NaNoWriMo<a href="#fn011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, and I‚Äôm currently doing well. I‚Äôve managed to write at least my word goal every day, and I‚Äôm almost a full day ahead now. Since the last time I attempted it<a href="#fn012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, the website has changed a lot. It‚Äôs much more user friendly now, and it‚Äôs far more gamified as well.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs even an achievement for hitting par<a href="#fn013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> every day in the month, which has been my primary motivating factor. One thing I have noticed, though, is that the daily goal appears to update based on how many words you have left to 50000. I wonder if that means it‚Äôll set itself to 0 when I surpass the goal.<a href="#fn014" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs some way for me to track it, but I don‚Äôt really feel like testing any of it right now.

<h1 id="reflections-on-todays-gospel"><a href="reflections-on-readings-32-ordinary-c-22.html">Reflections on Today‚Äôs Gospel</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 November 6</p>
<p>Luke 20:27 ‚ÄúSome Sadducees, those who deny that there is a resurrection, came forward and put this question to him,‚Äù</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today‚Äôs readings strike home for me. Mostly to me, the readings focus on legalism.</p>
<p>The Maccabees could be accused of dying on behalf of legalism. After all, is the commandment not to eat pork really more important than the commandment to live? Similarly, in homilies I‚Äôve heard, I‚Äôve generally seen malice attributed to the Sadducees.</p>
<p>The framing is always them trying to trap Our Lord in some sort of a logical quandary. I guess I don‚Äôt see an issue with that. One thing that we know for certain about the Lord and His Promises is that they are consistent. If we can reach different answers from different<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> starting facts, that is a legitimate concern about the faith.</p>
<p>And so, I choose to see the Sadducees as truly wondering. In the world view that they have, there is no way for this woman to be married to all seven men, but also no way to choose between them. That‚Äôs an obvious problem to the resurrection of the dead.</p>
<p>Our Lord‚Äôs response is incredibly stunning. Rather than rebuke them, He answers their questions in full. More than that, though, He answers the questions that they were trying to ask as well.</p>
<p>It really reminds me of how one person‚Äôs legalistic question is another‚Äôs genuine stumbling block to belief. I saw a post recently that said the incredible specificity with which all of our most dearly held beliefs have is a sign that there‚Äôs something wrong with the Church. I see it as the opposite: we know better and better what the true Truth is, because we know what is not it.</p>

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>First, apparently I never published my <a href="writers-block-4.html">last writer‚Äôs block post</a>, and instead linked to an older one. Wild.</p>
<p>Anyways, for whatever reason, I can‚Äôt think of what to blog about today. I‚Äôve written over 2000 words of my novel, which is nice, and this is my last activity with my computer before I write my poem of the day.<a href="#fn041" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I guess I could talk about how those are going.</p>
<p>The novel is going interestingly, because it‚Äôs not something that I did even the slightest bit of planning about. More or less, the impetus for the novel was a few vignettes that I‚Äôd been thinking about, which had no temporal connection. As a result, writing them results in something very much the same.</p>
<p>In the poem, I wrote a meta-poem villanelle the first day and a sonnet the second. Today I‚Äôm going to try a free poem, but who knows how well that will go. Huh, just like that, I‚Äôm at over 150 words.</p>

<p>Today is the Feast of All Souls. There‚Äôs an indulgence attached to praying at a graveyard. A friend invited me to go pray at a graveyard with them, and it was really nice.

<p>Another month, another monthly reflection.</p>
<p>My goals were:<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Blog daily. Eventually this goal will happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch daily. I‚Äôm going to stretch right after this, just so I make sure to do it.</p></li>
<li><p>Figure out how to repair/improve my accordion case. I made some notes today, and I think I should be able to get some of it done by the end of the month.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a poem every day. I did feel like the poems I wrote helped me ease into sleep, and they certainly help me write songs better.</p></li>
<li><p>Finish the newest song I‚Äôm working on.</p></li>
<li><p>Make progress on catching up for BiaY.</p></li>
<li><p>Fill in at least 3 more items on my 24 for 24.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>How‚Äôd we do?</p>
<ol>
<li><p>17/31 blogs. That‚Äôs more than half, so improvement.</p></li>
<li><p>I had about a week where I stretched, so that didn‚Äôt go horribly.</p></li>
<li><p>Turns out repair was as simple as taping it back together, so I gave up on that project.</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote a couple of poems, rough estimate of 12, so could do better.</p></li>
<li><p>I not only finished it, I‚Äôve performed it!</p></li>
<li><p>Lots of progress, I‚Äôm now at day 232.</p></li>
<li><p>I added two new points, so I‚Äôm on schedule if not my goal</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In the next month I‚Äôm going to try:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Blog every day. I believe in this month.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch every day.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a poem every day. I‚Äôm doing a poem a day with some friends, so I‚Äôm accountable there.</p></li>
<li><p>Finish NaNoWriMo successfully</p></li>
<li><p>Make progress towards catching up on BiaY</p></li>
<li><p>At least two entries in 24<span class="math inline"><sup>2</sup></span>.</p></li>

<p>Last night went well! I ended up doing my two original songs and Stan Roger‚Äôs ‚ÄúMaid on the Shore,‚Äù because it‚Äôs a little bit spooky, which is good Halloween vibes. I had another person comment that the song seemed incredibly sad, and that I seemed sad while performing it, which is fun. It‚Äôs especially fun because they then commented on how not sad I seem otherwise.</p>
<p>I ended up staying later than normal, and played another set. That one was significantly less prepared, so I did two more Stan Rogers songs that I kind of know. It could have gone better but, that‚Äôs the way the cookie crumbles. I realize I never actually figured out how to end them in playing, so it was awkward.</p>

<p>I appreciate how last week we heard about the tax collector who knew he was a sinful man, and this week we hear about Zacchaeus, a tax collector, who is called to the faith. Something that stuck out to me in particular is his line ‚Äúif I have extorted anything from anyone I shall repay it four times over.‚Äù In the homily I listened to, the priest mentioned that he absolutely extorted, which is likely where the other half of his wealth would go.</p>
<p>I, on the other hand, took Zacchaeus at his word. One recurring message these past weeks is the contrast between perceived holiness and actual holiness. ‚ÄúOf course Zacchaeus extorted‚Äù, we and the people at the time would say. And yet, what if he didn‚Äôt?</p>
<p>Too often I find myself judging, making wild extrapolations from minimal data. To me, at least, yesterday‚Äôs Gospel called us to reflect on why we assume the worst from those who we barely know.</p>

<p>First Published: 2022 October 28</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Way back <a href="nanowrimo.tex">in the initial iteration of this blog</a>, I attempted the National Novel Writer‚Äôs Month (NaNoWriMo). I think<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> that I mostly just tried to hit the wordcount<a href="#fn092" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> in these blog posts. My logic then was that I had far more free time, as I was lacking the obligations of ‚Äúsport, ensembles, (most of) my instruments, much of the studying, a job, etc‚Äù, and so should be able to do it. Today much of that is true as well, and I would really like to see if I can write a novel in a month.</p>
<p>Of course, it‚Äôs not going to be good, but I‚Äôve started actively scheduling time in my day to write<a href="#fn093" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, and it‚Äôs worked well for creating ideas. I also really have a lot of ideas I want to read, and the only realistic way that will happen is if I become the writer for them. Back then I was apparently writing around 750 words a day, which is far more than my posts lately<a href="#fn094" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. But, having now written a book<a href="#fn095" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>, I feel more able to write a long<a href="#fn096" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>-form piece of creative prose.</p>
