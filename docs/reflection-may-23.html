<p>First Published: 2023 June 1</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Oh wow, it’s been over two weeks since my last post. I have no clue where the days go. I did write around 36000 words last month, so that’s somewhat exciting, even if almost none of them were for this blog.</p>
<p>My goals <a href="reflection-april-23.html">last month</a> broke into a few categories. If I had checked up on them, I’m sure that it would have been useful to have them in that order. Instead, I just forgot that they existed until I began writing this post.</p>
<p>Rather than list the list again, I’ll just go through how I did on them.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Professional:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I did not manage to get running on my instrument this past month, which I at least now know why.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Probably because of the above item’s issues, I did not finish building the other instrument.</p></li>
<li><p>I did finish TAing and I even got mostly positive reviews!</p></li>
<li><p>I prepared for a talk at a state wildlife area, which is apparently distinct from a state park. It went really well, and I had 53 people come! I should absolutely blog about that, so expect a post soon.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Personal:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I deep cleaned my home to at least my own standards.</p></li>
<li><p>I finished the book I didn’t enjoy and managed to at least stay on the writing schedule I needed for the one I am enjoying. I kept hoping to pull ahead but haven’t managed it yet.</p></li>
<li><p>I am now I think good enough at bagpipes to where I won’t embarrass myself next week. There are a shocking number of interactions I have had related to playing the pipes these past weeks, which also deserve a posting of their own.</p></li>
<li><p>I don’t think that I played particularly more music, but I don’t know if I dislike that too much.</p></li>
<li><p>I spent some time working on a song but not enough to break the wall of writer’s block. I should really just get back into writing poetry.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Growth:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I have off and on been able to make more time for prayer.</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote none letters, though I did see friends in person!</p></li>
<li><p>Oof, I did not blog daily. I blogged half as much last month as in April.</p></li>
<li><p>I ran I think zero times.</p></li>
<li><p>I mostly stopped working out.</p></li>
<li><p>I actually did manage to go to bed generally early! My default wake time has shifted to be nearly six am now which is nice.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Looking forward at this month, I would like to:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Accomplishments/Finite Tasks<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Play bagpipes at a friend’s wedding</p></li>
<li><p>Write and give a talk at a conference</p></li>
<li><p>Get my instrument running</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Growth</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Invite friends over to my home at least once.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Blog!<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Start exercising at least three times a week</p></li>
<li><p>Push myself to actually sleep enough and still get up at six.</p></li>
<li><p>Make time for prayer</p></li>
<li><p>Get five chapters ahead on the book I’m writing</p></li>
<li><p>Write a song</p></li>
<li><p>Write at least three letters to friends</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>This might be a better way to frame my goals. In general, there are things that I want to have accomplished, and things I want to do.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Hopefully I’ll be able to keep up with this more!</p>

<li id="fn6"><p>oh, shoot, that’s actually something I should blog about. I had a whole idea going about the difference between things I want to do, things I do, and things I want to have done. adding to list<a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
