<p>Yesterday I went through the past two months of my life, reflecting a little on what I did. One thing I did which I’m very happy about is that I made my yearly recipe of lemon wine.</p>
<p>Lemon wine is a recipe I have adapted<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> from <a href="skeeterpee.com">here</a>. It’s functionally just lemonade that you add yeast to, but I really enjoy it, and it seems like my peers did as well.</p>
<p>Briefly, I cooked boiled 8 pounds of sugar in water with a heavy splash of lemon juice to hopefully break the dimerized sugar into monomers. From there, I combined it with two quarts of lemon juice with yeast nutrient and water to make 5ish gallons, and added EC-81 yeast. I then measured its density and aerated it 1-2 times a day for the next four days, until the density readings showed it was approximately halfway through fermentation. At that point I added another quart of lemon juice and sealed the container</p>
<p>I then left it alone for 10ish days, at which point it was finished fermenting. I then transferred it off the lees<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> and let it sit for about a month. At that point I backsweetened it and bottled it up.</p>
<p>It’s always really fun to share with friends because homemade goods feel better to share than storebought, at least for me.</p>
