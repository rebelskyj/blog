<p>It’s officially one week into NaNoWriMo<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, and I’m currently doing well. I’ve managed to write at least my word goal every day, and I’m almost a full day ahead now. Since the last time I attempted it<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, the website has changed a lot. It’s much more user friendly now, and it’s far more gamified as well.</p>
<p>There’s even an achievement for hitting par<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> every day in the month, which has been my primary motivating factor. One thing I have noticed, though, is that the daily goal appears to update based on how many words you have left to 50000. I wonder if that means it’ll set itself to 0 when I surpass the goal.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

I can’t tell how much of that is due to increases in typing speeds, increases in knowing what I want to write, decreases in forced revision and pauses for words, or decreases in average word length. I’m sure there’s some way for me to track it, but I don’t really feel like testing any of it right now. All I know is my last 10 minute writing session was over 700 words, which is about as fast as I’ve scored on some typing tests.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
