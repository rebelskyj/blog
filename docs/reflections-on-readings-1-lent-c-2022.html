<p>First Published: 2022 March 6</p>
<p>Deuteronomy 26:7: “we cried to the LORD, the God of our ancestors, and the LORD heard our cry and saw our affliction, our toil and our oppression”</p>

<p>The Lenten Season has begun, and with it the change of emotion for the readings. This Gospel has been interesting to me since I learned that Satan in the Old Testament is not a rebel angel, but one of the faithful.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> It causes me to wonder a bit whether the temptations that our Lord receives are from the Betrayer or from a loyal angel simply doing his job. In the end, it doesn’t really matter, because our Lord resists the temptations, even while starving.</p>
<p>I don’t know if I could stop myself from making bread from stones if I had fasted for a day, let alone forty. We are called to be more like Christ in every way, and self-denial is definitely somewhere I can improve.</p>
