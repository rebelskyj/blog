<p>This year I chose not to participate in a yearly tradition that was titled <em>n</em> for <em>n</em>. While what that initially meant is unimportant, what’s important is that I’ve decided to reincorporate the name. Instead of meaning whatever it used to,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I’m going to try to learn 24 new skills while I’m 24. These can be actual skills, like an instrument or language, or things I just had never done and so had no way to do them. I’ll also include skills I once had but no longer do, such as picking up an instrument I’ve forgotten or doing some athletic feat that I needed to retrain for. I’ll keep this list updated with them, and may remove them depending on how things go. Thus far I really only have one, but I’m hopeful to add more.</p>

<p>Thanks for following me on this journey! I’m hopeful that this will let me reflect on the passage of time more intentionally.

<p>Note 15 May: I’ve apparently done thirteen<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> new things this year, which is five<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> fewer than I would like to be at now.
