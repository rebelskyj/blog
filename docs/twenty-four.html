<p>First Published: 2022 August 22</p>
<h1 id="draft-2-1-october-2022-added-new-notes">Draft 2: 1 October 2022, added new notes</h1>
<p>This year I chose not to participate in a yearly tradition that was titled <em>n</em> for <em>n</em>. While what that initially meant is unimportant, what’s important is that I’ve decided to reincorporate the name. Instead of meaning whatever it used to,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I’m going to try to learn 24 new skills while I’m 24. These can be actual skills, like an instrument or language, or things I just had never done and so had no way to do them. I’ll also include skills I once had but no longer do, such as picking up an instrument I’ve forgotten or doing some athletic feat that I needed to retrain for. I’ll keep this list updated with them, and may remove them depending on how things go. Thus far I really only have one, but I’m hopeful to add more.</p>

<li><p>As I’ve alluded too <a href="open-mic-2.html">before</a>, I’ve started playing at open mics. I’m going to put the skills of “playing with a partner” and “regularly doing an open mic”<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> together, since each is really only half of a new skill.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>I’ve also started playing with a band now, so together it’s for sure at least one skill.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I <a href="performing-a-song.html">performed an original song</a> at an open mic! (added 1 October)</p></li>
<li><p>I learned how to do basic accordion repair! (added/did 1 October, post to follow later)</p></li>
<li><p>I <a href="running-2.html">was able to run five miles!</a> (added 1 October)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks for following me on this journey! I’m hopeful that this will let me reflect on the passage of time more intentionally. I’m also hopeful that it will mean that next summer, when I<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> have far too few entries, I’ll use some time to branch out and try new things.</p>
<p>Note 1 October: I’m currently slightly ahead of schedule for skills which is fun! At some point I may want to trim down and condense skills, but that’s a problem if I do too well only.</p>
