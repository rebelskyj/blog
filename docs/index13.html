<p>I learned two new dives! 404<a href="#fn001" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> on one meter, and 405<a href="#fn002" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> on three meter. They went varyingly well, depending on how well I jumped. But, they’re both in for this weekend, which is terrifying and exciting.</p>

<p>The last day of break always fills me with mixed emotions. On one hand, it’s always a change, which is scary. On the other, I really miss academics, and the pressure of needing to accomplish tasks. So, I tend to feel mixed, though more positively than negatively.</p>

<p>John 2:3-5: “When the wine ran short, the mother of Jesus said to him, ‘They have no wine.’ Jesus said to her, ‘Woman, how does your concern affect me? My hour has not yet come.’ His mother said to the servers, ‘Do whatever he tells you.’”</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today’s readings are a set that my family has always enjoyed. Mostly, it’s due to the non-sequitur in the Gospel. Mary says that there’s no wine, Jesus says it isn’t his problem, and then solves it anyways.</p>
<p>It also leads nicely into the joke I’ve always enjoyed telling friends when they ask why Mary is such a big deal in the Catholic Church.<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Jesus is a good Jewish boy. Good Jewish boys listen to their mother. Mary loves us and listens to all of our prayers. So, if you pray to Mary, Jesus has to listen.</p>
<p>Of course, I have no idea how accurate this joke is theologically, but I hope.</p>

<p>Today, I got to watch my little brother at one of his last high school swim meets. During it, he lost his goggles as he started his 100 butterfly. And then he set a new personal best, by a not-insignificant margin. It’s sad when that happens, because now there’s an incentive to dive goggleless.</p>

<p>First Published: 2019 January 13</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>We’re getting ready to return to Grinnell. As a result, we decided to clear out our food. We had around two pounds of bread, a pound of brown sugar, salt,<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and a packet of yeast. So, I decided to make bread.</p>
<p>With the one packet of yeast added to most of the flour, I dumped in the very precise measurements of “some” salt and brown sugar. That being accomplished,<a href="#fn082" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> I added water to the flour. As I realized that there was still far too much flour, I found out we also had extra milk. So, I added more flour, and I<a href="#fn083" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> added milk to the flour, and continued to work.</p>
<p>I then got bored while kneading, so picked up the dough and kneaded as I walked and visited other rooms. After letting it rise for 2.5 hours,<a href="#fn084" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> I rekneaded, and let rest for the entirely unreasonable length of 3 minutes.<a href="#fn085" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> I put it in the oven and walked away for ten minutes.</p>
<p>When I returned, the bread looked more like a cake. It had risen quite nicely. Of course, it wasn’t browning, even after 30 minutes, so I bumped the temp from 350 to 400.<a href="#fn086" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> It still didn’t brown, but did turn a nice light brown colour.<a href="#fn087" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Reviews from housemates were positive. As for myself, I’d give it a solid neutral. As my father would say, “c’est la vie.”<a href="#fn088" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>Isaiah 40:1: “Comfort, give comfort to my people, says your God.”</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today’s readings, as are to be expected from the day of the Lord’s baptism, are rather joyful. To me, the line which best sums up this week’s message is the first of Isaiah Chapter 40. The readings focus on the comfort and knowledge that the Lord has come, loves us, and chooses us each and every day.</p>
<p>In the Gospel itself, I love the fact that Luke makes it clear that “the Holy Spirit descended upon him in <strong>bodily form</strong>,”<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#fn092" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> while the other two synoptic Gospels only state that the Spirit descends. For me, at least, part of the faith that is so important is the physical nature. As we’re taught about sacraments, they’re physical manifestations of internal realities. Unlike other Christian faiths, we believe that the Body and Blood is truly present in the Eucharist.</p>
