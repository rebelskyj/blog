<p>First Published: 2023 May 3</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Twice a year, the website I’ve been self publishing my web serials on has a competition: write 55,555 words in 5 weeks. The latest one began this year on the first of April, and I set a variety of goals related to it. As I mentioned <a href="writing-3.html">in my last writing post</a>, I wanted to write more words each day that I wrote. That goal didn’t end up panning out, though I did end up still writing 78010 words in April.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Another goal I had was posting a chapter for the new book every day at 2:08 PM CST until I hit the word count for the challenge. I accomplished that, though I did become far looser on my personal idiolectal usage of hyphens.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>I also had the goal of maintaining my 3/week schedule of the book I had started before Writathon. I accomplished that.</p>
<p>I had the goal of completing Writathon, which I tangentially answered as having done above. To be clear, i did it.</p>
<p>Finally, I had a goal of learning to write combat scenes. I still don’t know if I’m fantastic at it, but I think that the scenes I wrote were at least serviceable.</p>
<p>I certainly feel like I grew a lot as a writer, if only in terms of learning to write content I am willing to put out into the world faster. Partially that was lowering my standards, but I also think that I grew a lot as a writer in terms of thinking in a way that transfers to the page more easily. These past few days in particular, I noticed that I was restarting sentences two or three times as I saw how they wouldn’t end correctly. Historically, I would have needed to reread the entire chapter to notice that mistake.</p>
<p>So, while I’m still unsure if I plan to do Writathon ever again, I’m certainly glad that I took part in it. If I can maintain my average of over 2700<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> words every day that I write<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>, I think that it would remain a very doable activity.</p>

I didn’t include titles, the cases where I have macros defined for words (I use tables that have “Congratulations!” in them often enough that it seemed worthwhile to define a table that says congratulations), or any other writing I needed to do for life and whatnot<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
