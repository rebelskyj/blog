<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Once more, I’ve made it back from a conference where I didn’t blog at all. This is <a href="conference.html">the other important</a> conference my group goes to. It happens<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> bidecadally<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, which means this is likely going to be the only time that I attend it. In part because I was exhausted from beforehand, I don’t know if I retained as much science at this conference as I would have liked. But, I do absolutely think that I had a lot more professional networking than I expected to</p>
<p>This conference was for the entirety of my<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> field. There were two poster sessions and otherwise almost exclusively invited talks. The talks really ran the gamut for the entirety of the field.</p>
<p>External to the explicit conference but related because I was there at the geographical location in the specific time, I also had some fun experiences. They took us on a hike to a national lakeshore.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> I bought two supplies for brewing.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> I also learned<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> that I love pinball. I don’t really know what to make of that.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I did clean a little. More importantly, though, I made minimal mess, which means that I’m further ahead. A lot of that comes from closing a few cabinets that I perpetually leave open.</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote another chapter today! I did minimal poetry, though I am ok with that.</p></li>
<li><p>I’m accepting and embracing that I won’t really have time to exercise before Tuesday next.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I set an alarm for half seven today and woke up around six anyways. I’m now getting to bed too late, but will still be up bright<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> and early.</p></li>
<li><p>I listened to more CCCiaY, and I managed to find time to go to chapel to pray a rosary. It was really nice.</p></li>
<li><p>Today’s chapter was still longer than normal<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>, but shorter than yesterday’s. I’ve finished the first arc in my story, which is funny, because it took twice as many chapters as expected.</p></li>
<li><p>I’m not going to write explicit poetry today.</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote a letter and posted it. I remembered one person I was supposed to address a letter to, addressed it, and hopefully am not forgetting anyone. I also queued another letter to be addressed and then written.</p></li>
