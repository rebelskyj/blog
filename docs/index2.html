<p>First Published: 2023 December 18</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As I mentioned in <a href="dungeons-dragons-7">my last musing about dnd</a>, I made a character whose goal is rolling more dice more often. I don’t know if I actually optimized it, especially because a number of friends pointed out that spell slots are functionally infinite, especially in the kinds of combat that I’m likely to see. Next session I get to fifth level, which doubles the number of attacks I can use, potentially doubling the number of dice I roll a turn. That’s pretty nice.</p>
<p>This session, however, was also a great time. We began with a quick little combat, where we saw some demons<a href="#fn001" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and began to fight. I missed on my first attack, which was sad, so used an action surge to swing again.</p>
<p>Once more, I missed.</p>
<p>That set me up to be flanked, which did almost all of my remaining hit points<a href="#fn002" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. However, I managed to kill one monster on my next turn, and got another with an attack of opportunity. At that point, it was more or less cleanup.</p>
<p>After we defeated the monsters, we were led into a room with puzzles. The puzzles were all fun, and done more or less completely out of character. It’s always fun to have to actually think, rather than simply saying “my character thinks”.</p>
<p>When we managed to solve the riddles, we were given the ability to teleport to waypoints, which feels like it could be a fun mechanic. We were offered the choice to return to the city we had come from, or to teleport further west. Our group chose to go to the West.<a href="#fn003" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Once there, we discovered a town of tieflings that were being plagued by spirits. The story, as we dug into it, seemed to be that there was a chief who committed abominations<a href="#fn004" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>, and something something punishment. One of the consequences was that their harvests would rot.<a href="#fn005" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> We are currently split, staking out the properties overnight to see what happens.<a href="#fn006" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>

<h1 id="reflections-on-todays-gospel"><a href="reflections-on-readings-3-advent-b-23.html">Reflections on Today’s Gospel</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 December 17</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>I love this set of readings, because each of them speaks to me in a way that I don’t normally feel from the readings. Intellectually, I know that every word in the Bible is beautiful, and each verse leads me closer to Truth. Emotionally, though, I don’t always connect.</p>
<p>I’d like to start with the Psalm.<a href="#fn011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The Psalm today really encapsulates the entirety of the readings. It is the Magnificat, the Canticle of Mary. That is, it is Mary’s response to seeing her cousin Elizabeth while both are carrying their child.</p>
<p>How does this sum up the readings? First, the Magnificat comes when John the Baptist leaps in his mother’s womb. The Gospel today is John’s ministry and preparation for the coming of the Christ.</p>
<p>Second, it is a prayer. The second reading exhorts us to pray unceasingly.</p>
<p>Finally, it is a song of joy and thanks to the Lord. The Magnificat is a message of joy and hope to the downtrodden and despised. The first reading, from the Prophet, also focuses on this.</p>
<p>The second reading is really just filled with a load of fantastic single lines. I could spend pages discussing more or less every phrase in the reading, but I’ll focus on one in particular.</p>
<p>St. Paul exhorts us to test everything, retaining what is good.<a href="#fn012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> In a conversation with friends yesterday, I was once again reminded that this approach is not the way that everyone is formed in their faith. In a different conversation, someone explained to me that questions can come from a place of judgement or of curiosity. I think that these two conversations point to the same idea: we either seek to find the truth or confirm what we know.</p>
<p>In raising a child, I cannot understand why you would want them to trust unquestioningly. I am reminded of a verse, where we are told that we are to have faith like children. Every child I’ve ever known has wondered endlessly. When they ask why something is true, they then wonder why the response is true. Of course, there is an element of trust there. A child believes what you tell her.</p>
<p>And so, we are reminded that we must have a faith like that. I have hope that the Pharisees in the Gospel were questioning John on those lines. If someone today preached that they had a new way of forgiving sins, I would be incredibly skeptical. How much moreso would it have been for the faithful of the first century.</p>
<p>It is a common statement by Catholics that the Church is either the Truth and Holiness, or the most vile blasphemy possible. We see reminders of that in the Gospel. John is baptizing in the name of the one who is to come, the one who can forgive all sins. It becomes a fulfillment of the Prophets first reading.</p>
<p>Christ’s ministry was one of healing the ill and uplifting the poor. Throughout the history of the Church, it has spread most by the downtrodden. Even today, many of the conversion or reversion stories I hear come from someone who was in a terrible place.</p>
<p>The Prophet reminds us that we are all called to this ministry. The Lord anointed him, sending His Spirit to rest on Isaiah. We receive that same Spirit in baptism, and we are sealed in it during confirmation.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I embroider today? Embroidery remains trapped in the office. However, the person who got the first embroidered piece liked it.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I play guitar today? I think that I’m starting to like the higher harmonics twang of the new strings.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I practice touch typing today? SHoot!</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Reading</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have I made progress on my Currently Reading Shelf? I finished the first audiobook and started the second.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I read the book on craft? I read a little further and then immediately got inspiration, which is common in the book.</p></li>
<li><p>Have I read the library books? Still no.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write a sonnet? I forgot to write one yesterday, I think at least. That’s a shame. Today’s was pretty good, though.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I revise a sonnet? I had some fits and starts, which meant that I revised as I went.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? I find that the second draft is way cleaner than the first, which makes some amount of sense.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write ahead on Jeb? I wrote another quarter chapter, since I didn’t want to do too much writing on a Sunday.</p></li>
<li><p>Letter to friends? I chatted with someone else who writes letters today. While working on my computer, I realized that I want my writing to count for the arbitrary word goals on this app, which might be part of why I struggle to get letters written. Given that the site explicitly encourages using the word counts as rewards for other tasks, though, maybe it’s worthwhile to just tell myself a letter is worth 250 words and then lorem ipsum it?</p></li>
<li><p>Paper? I started writing an introduction to rotational spectroscopy, then realized that I don’t know how to frame it. Some ideas include: imagine how things rotate normally, now imagine a molecule; imagine a molecule, now think about it rotating; there’s light in space, why?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Wellness</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How well did I pray? Not great, but I hope that I can start to do better.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I clean my space? A little.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I spend my time well? Honestly pretty well! I got through a lot of what I wanted to do.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? No.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I exercise? I played basketball with the religious ed kids, which was fun. Turns out basketball is much easier when you have a sense of proprioception.<a href="#fn013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Water? I actually think that was something I did well on today, for once. I feel like I drank an appropriate amount of water through most of the day.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>This week’s readings, in a shocking turn of events, are not a struggle for me. Do not get me wrong. I do not sit easily with these readings, completely unaffected. My struggle with these readings is simply in how poorly I live them out.</p>
<p>The first reading comes from the Prophet.<a href="#fn014" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> It opens with a really powerful verse,<a href="#fn015" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> where we are told a few important facts.</p>
<p>In brief, the Lord anoints us and sends His Spirit on us. When we are given the Spirit, we are given a mission. In the case of the Prophet, the mission is to lift up the downtrodden, and a few specific examples are given.<a href="#fn016" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Of course, we as baptized are anointed and given the Spirit. We too have a mission. As Christ reminds us, everything that Isaiah said was his mission in this verse is also a mission we share. We are to comfort the grieving, set free the prisoners, and strive for justice and liberty.</p>
<p>The second verse is where it shifts outside of the conventional modern Christian framework, though. We are told that Isaiah was sent to proclaim a year of Jubilee. Jubilee is a concept that has completely disappeared from the modern consciousness, for all that it is<a href="#fn017" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> an absolutely essential component of a healthy society. In a year of Jubilee, all debts are forgiven.</p>
<p>Now, there are some obvious reasons that we do not have this concept anymore. First, we legally treat corporations as though they are people, and that has bled into the way we discuss things. Copyright<a href="#fn018" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> laws are described as letting corporations own the rights to their work, rather than artists. There is no real reason that a corporation should have its debt forgiven, for much the same reason that there is no reason that a corporation or country having debt is inherently a problem.</p>
<p>The reason that debt is a problem to fall into is that we all know that there is a maximum amount of time that we will work. At some point, we will stop producing, and there will be no new income to pay off our debts. Corporations<a href="#fn019" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>, by contrast, can continue to cycle out workers indefinitely, and so there is no inherent timeline wherein they stop producing income.</p>
<p>Other than the fact that we treat corporations as people, though, the only reasons I’ve seen for not instituting Jubilee are based in the goal of raising corporations above people or in the goal of keeping oppressed down. If we forgive debt, the most common narrative goes, then the companies which issued the debt will be in trouble. Or, as comes up so frequently in discussions about student loans, if we forgive debt, then that just encourages people to take out more loans and live above their means.</p>
<p>In part, that is because of the system we have created, where student debt in particular is nearly impossible to discharge. Even if we did not have a Year of Jubilee, and instead just stopped debts from reaching a point that they are impossible to pay off, then we would see a radical shift in the structure of modern economies. Sorry, didn’t mean to go on a rant here, returning to the readings.</p>
<p>The second reading reminded me of a conversation that I had with friends yesterday. We were discussing, among other things, our own relationships to the faiths that our parents had raised us with. One stark difference between us was that I was raised with the belief that, not only was it ok to question what we are taught, it is actively good. It’s always nice when the Bible supports the take that you have.</p>
<p>St. Paul writes that we should test everything, retaining what is good.<a href="#fn0110" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> I do believe that statement would do wonders in helping the world as we know it. However, it is a difficult statement to practice.</p>
<p>How do we know what is good? Even outside of the concept of forming a conscience, there is the issue of large scale differences. What is good for an individual may be bad for society, or the reverse.<a href="#fn0111" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> How should we balance the conflicting needs of a group to have its members in good condition and each member to live to his or her fullest? I’m not really sure, and that’s just an immediate issue that comes to mind with the question.</p>
<p>However, the existence of edge cases does not preclude heuristics.<a href="#fn0112" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> That is,<a href="#fn0113" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> the fact that there are times that a general principle does not apply does not mean that it doesn’t work in general. If I say, for instance, that children are short, “all” is absolutely implicit in that statement. Even if we find a child who is tall<a href="#fn0114" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>, that does not mean that most children do not remain short.</p>
<p>And so, there are obviously cases where we can look at things and see that they are harmful. Modern psychology agrees that believing that you are unable to improve yourself harms you. Going into the spiritual, believing that to question your faith is to not believe it will lead you either to an unfulfilled life, where you cannot say what you truly believe, or a life where you lose your faith as you question it. Any other examples I can think of are too emotionally charged, and so I’ll leave them as an exercise to the reader.</p>
<p>Where were we?</p>
<p>Right, the second reading reminds us that we are to confront the beliefs that we have, making sure that they lead ourselves and the world to the Lord, our G-d.</p>
<p>I normally skip the Psalm, but I love the Canticle<a href="#fn0115" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> of Mary, which were the verses.<a href="#fn0116" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>And finally, we make our way to the Gospel. I think that this was the first year that I realized that John was doing his preaching while Jesus lived his own private life. As much as I know and truly believe that Christ was born around 30 years before he died, the lack of anything between his childhood and public ministry sometimes makes me forget that they must have happened. While John was preaching his message of repentance, Christ was working in his earthly father’s shop.<a href="#fn0117" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>There’s absolutely something worth meditating on there. First, there’s the statement that Christ makes, which is that whatever we do to the least of people, that we have done to him. I can imagine someone going to baptism in the Jordan, and then seeing Christ in his home. Somehow, they cannot see that the Lord is incarnate in front of them.</p>
<p>More than that, though, it is a reminder that everything has its season. If Christ had begun his public ministry in the Temple when his parents found him as a child, we would not have had the St. John the Baptist. That would have meant that a number of prophecies went unfulfilled.</p>
<p>And, of course, it is here that we see the Pharisees doing as St. Paul commands. They hear that a man is baptizing and preaching repentance. Unsure what that means, they go to question him. John replies honestly.</p>
<p>He is not Elijah, nor the Prophet, nor the Christ. He is simply the voice in the desert<a href="#fn0118" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> telling us to prepare the way.</p>
<p>Ok, this musing got a little out of hand, I think that I should revise it. First, though, there’s bound to be a way to tie the first reading to the Gospel. I can’t think of one, though, so I guess I’ll just have to hope that inspiration strikes while I write the next draft.</p>

<h1 id="on-ratings"><a href="ratings.html">On Ratings</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 December 16</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>What’s the point of rating anything? Ok, that’s a little broad, let’s try that again.<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>A friend asked me to think about five star ratings for books, especially on the pseudo public platforms which aggregate ratings. As I thought about that question, I came to a number of potential responses.</p>
<p>First, I think that five is too many options. Really, I think that you only need two, maybe three if you want to be mean. The two would be enjoyed or did not enjoy, and the third could be for did not finish if you wanted to separate books you read all the way through. I would be very happy with just the two ratings, though.</p>
<p>So, what do I do when I’m given five stars? There’s an impulse to only use one and five star ratings<a href="#fn022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> However, that feels lacking. If I’m painting in black and white, I shouldn’t just ignore the shades of grey<a href="#fn023" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> just because they’re new and scary.</p>
<p>So, let’s consider how I could use five stars. One star could be the third bin that I had before, books that I could not finish because they were so poorly written. Thankfully, very few books that I’ve encountered fall into this category, if only because most people who put books out in a public enough form that I find them have a competent grasp on the English language.<a href="#fn024" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Five stars would have to be the absolute favorite books ever written. The kind of books that you can’t stop talking about when you read them, to the point that your friends feel obligated to either end the friendship or read the book themselves.</p>
<p>Even though I like shades of grey, I’ve always admired paintings that work in shades of black.<a href="#fn025" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> And so, I can find a use for two stars: books that I didn’t finish because I didn’t enjoy them. These would be books that I’m certain others would enjoy, I just wasn’t one of them when I encountered it.<a href="#fn026" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Four stars would be books that I really liked, but that I haven’t made into a facet of my personality. And, of course, that leaves three stars to hold the rest of the books, the majority of what I read.<a href="#fn027" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>But, this is a single dimensional view of the process. For all that<a href="#fn028" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> I do think that most books I read fit that scale, it does have some gray areas. Between a book with an astounding concept and fair<a href="#fn029" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> execution and a book that brings nothing new to the genre but does what it sets out to perfectly, which deserves a higher score? As I once dove,<a href="#fn0210" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> I then find a use for the fractional stars.<a href="#fn0211" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>In diving, two criteria determine your score: how well you did the dive and how hard the dive was. The difficulty of the dive modifies how much the points for your dive are worth. Doing that, I could have a few modifiers and apply them to my base score, putting books in the correct bin as needed.</p>
<p>Of course, this single bin approach to diving works because we can generally agree what the optimal dive looks like.<a href="#fn0212" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Books, however, serve a variety of purposes, and what makes a book successful in one domain is often what precludes its success in another. Most modern sites are aware of this fact, and allow for tagging of books so that people can remember that one book is a cozy pastoral fantasy<a href="#fn0213" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> and another is a fast paced exploration of morality.<a href="#fn0214" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Then, of course, the rubric breaks down. I now, on some level, need to have separate rubrics for each tag and combination of tags. This all ignores the fact<a href="#fn0215" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> that modern sites aggregate the data. Here we come to a new issue.</p>
<p>I, like most people, am aware on some level that my time on this earth is finite. I do not have the time to read every book that comes out in a given month, let alone every book that comes out every month. And so, I rely on the aggregation of other readers in deciding what to read, at least on some level.<a href="#fn0216" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> This comes with a conundrum.</p>
<p>When I rate something with four stars, it falls below a book that I rate with five stars. And so, all the different criteria end up collapsing into that same rating system I introduced at the start of the musing: good<a href="#fn0217" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> or bad<a href="#fn0218" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>. I’ve heard it described as five stars means you were ok with it, and everything below five is how much you disliked it, which isn’t that far off from the way that ratings end up playing out.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I embroider today? I sadly didn’t end up going into the office today. Embroidery remains trapped there.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I play guitar today? I did! I’d been noodling on guitar and it reminded me of the opening to a song, so I sang through it.<a href="#fn0219" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> After that, I played some scales.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I practice touch typing today? This day has flown by, and even though I wouldn’t change most of what I did, that doesn’t make the time come back.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Reading</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have I made progress on my Currently Reading Shelf? I listened to a little more of the audio book! Soon it will be finished, which is cool.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I read the book on craft? On my daily goals this morning, I did put it on the list, but didn’t get around to it, sadly enough.</p></li>
<li><p>Have I read the library books? I renewed my books, which is a step in the direction of believing that I’ll read them. Maybe I have to return two books a month minus however many I read starting next month? That would make me sad but might make me read more books. At the very least, I’d decrease my bookshelf by 2 a month.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write a sonnet? Yesterday I actually liked the sonnet I wrote. Today’s was pretty decent</p></li>
<li><p>Did I revise a sonnet? Nope. I think that I’ve learned how to do so, though, which was the monthly goal.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? I actually kind of like the post today.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write ahead on Jeb? I wrote about half a chapter. If I weren’t so tired, I’d do more.</p></li>
<li><p>Letter to friends? I should remove this goal, since I doubt I’ll make progress on it before the year is out.</p></li>
<li><p>Paper? I thought about what I’d want it to say at a large scale picture.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Wellness</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How well did I pray? Oof.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I clean my space? Yes, but I think the net was dirty.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I spend my time well? Kind of! I was somewhat thoughtless through the day, but that’s kind of to be expected.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? Shoot.</p></li>

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Yesterday a friend asked me about my feelings on five star scales. As I thought about it a little more, though, I realized that I have a lot of feelings about rating systems in general. Today seems like as good of a place as any to discuss how I feel about them.</p>
<p>Rating systems, especially as they exist now, suffer from the tragedy of the commons.<a href="#fn0220" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> Most rating systems are not used for individuals, but for public ranking. That’s an issue, for a lot of reasons.</p>
<p>Let’s explore why.<a href="#fn0221" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>If I have five stars to rate every book I read, for instance, there are a few ways that I could do it. Assuming that 0 stars is not an option, of course, I only have five categories to place absolutely everything I read. There are few easy books to place.</p>
<p>First, there are the books that I read over and over, finding something different in them each time. The sort of books that we love because they feel able to grow with us just as much as we grow. They, obviously, would get five stars.</p>
<p>On the opposite end of the spectrum, there are a lot of things that I’ve read that I could not get more than a few pages into<a href="#fn0222" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> because there was absolutely no sense of grammar, tense, or spelling. An argument could be made that ratings should be reserved for books I’ve finished, and not for everything I’ve tried to read. Of course, if I have a rating system, I want it to be a record that I can use in the future. Since that’s true, I want to show everything that I’ve attempted to read.</p>
<p>So, that’s one star and five stars taken care of. What about books that I couldn’t get through, just because I didn’t enjoy them? It feels very unfair to put them at the same place as books that I couldn’t read because they were illegible<a href="#fn0223" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>, which implies that I should put it at two stars.</p>
<p>Looking at the other direction, there are a lot of books that I enjoyed, but would not plan to reread because I don’t think that there’s anything more that I want to gather from the book.<a href="#fn0224" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> Or, there are books that I plan to reread, not because I find that they are thought provoking or help me grow, but because they’re comfortable. Similar to a nice bowl of Kraft brand mac and cheese, sometimes you aren’t looking for the best, simply the most familiar.</p>
<p>And that leaves one star for everything else I read. Three stars would mean that I finished the book, and either didn’t enjoy it, or don’t plan to reread. Honestly, most books that I read should fall here, if we think that stars should be averaged. Then again, if I consider that I know what I like to read, it would make sense that the books I read would generally be above the baseline.</p>
<p>Of course, this creates an immediate tension. Five stars works best if there’s even distribution between categories. For instance, if I put all books that I did not finish as one star, I then have four stars to granulate my feelings, rather than simply three. Others might immediately point out that fractional stars exist.</p>
<p>Honestly, I find that fractional stars start to become worse than useless for me very quickly. Once I get above general feelings of no, sure, yes, and absolutely<a href="#fn0225" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>, I don’t think it’s fair to grade books on a single axis. How do I compare a book that has fantastic ideas but less than stellar execution with a book that is not as thought provoking but does what it attempts perfectly? As a diver, there’s the voice in my head that says you add modifiers.</p>
<p>For those who don’t know, points in diving come from two, arguably separable places. First, there’s the score that the judges give. The sum of the three middle judges’ scores<a href="#fn0226" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> is the first point in scoring. In that regard, it is optimal to make sure that any dive you do is done to the absolute highest score possible.</p>
<p>However, there is a secondary consideration. Each dive is assigned a degree of difficulty. That value is multiplied by the first score to produce the final score for a dive. In that regard, it is optimal to attempt the most difficult dive possible, because it has the highest modifier.</p>
<p>Of course, since diving is a sport judged by humans, there are elements of bias. Dives that land on hands, for instance, tend to be scored more favorably than dives which end on feet. More than that, though, a lot of judges are more forgiving of small errors in more difficult dive, whether because it’s difficult to see every part of a more complex dive or because it just seems more impressive.</p>
<p>Before each meet, a diver therefore needs to consider how best to balance doing a dive well and doing a difficult dive. Returning to the book, it could make sense to make modifiers. Of course, since we’re still<a href="#fn0227" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> only on the single person use case for ratings. I don’t need to have hard numbers, especially if I read books fairly often. Having vague ideas of the modifiers I want to apply is probably good enough.</p>
<p>Now, the astute might notice that diving does collapse those two scores into one at the end. I could, in theory, do the same. However, I do not always want to read the same thing. I tend to have around ten books in my currently reading shelf. If we look at them, I can categorize them as<a href="#fn0228" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Two dense and difficult creative nonfiction books about topics I want to learn more about</p></li>
<li><p>Two dense theology books</p></li>
<li><p>Two literature books<a href="#fn0229" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Two somewhat hard books that I want to learn from.</p></li>
<li><p>Four beach reads,<a href="#fn0230" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> some of which are fiction, and some of which are nonfiction</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It isn’t fair to compare a beach read to a literature book, especially because the very things that make one good in its own genre are<a href="#fn0231" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> what would make it bad in the other genre or what disqualifies it. Now, of course, nearly every book sorting site has ways of adding categories to the books you read. If I then just rank each book with its modifiers and tags, I can sort the tagged books when I want to recommend or reread something. And, to some extent, that could work.</p>
<p>However, there are more than two factors that I want to consider. As much as it kind of feels wrong to say<a href="#fn0232" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a>, the politics that the author espouses in a book are relevant to how much I enjoy them. A book that has an interesting premise, is well written, but concludes with statements like how slavery is fundamentally a good thing, is not something that I want to recommend, if only because I don’t want anyone in my life to think that I think slavery is fundamentally good.<a href="#fn0233" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>So, we get to the point that reducing everything to a single number becomes somewhat meaningless. However, as I alluded to earlier, the danger with ratings is that they do not exist in a void. When I rate something, the ratings generally become somewhat public. Now, there’s a new level of consideration that I have to use.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I want to give accurate and useful ratings for my own purposes. On the other, I also want the authors I like to succeed. I know that a lot of people actively sort to find the highest ranked books within a genre. Truth be told, I cannot say that I am too different.</p>
<p>Of course, this does lead to a bit of a chicken and egg issue. The fact that only high rated books get read means that people are more likely to give anything they like five stars, which means that the quality of anything with less than five stars starts to drop dramatically. On one site I read often, grammar that is nearly impossible to understand is still given a three star by some commenters.<a href="#fn0234" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> As this cycle continues, each feeds more and more into the other, making it so that the rating system would really be best served by a simple positive or negative. I remember seeing that Netflix had switched to that, and I think they found it was more effective for what they wanted.</p>
<p>So, right now I’ve only discussed books and rating them on a five point scale.<a href="#fn0235" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> I think that most of the lessons that I want to hit on are more or less the same. Time to revise this and see if we can’t make the writing sparkle a little more. Might be worth framing the whole thing as “start from yes no, then grow into five stars, then grow into multi dimension that collapses, then go to tags, then back”, because there’s fun in dramatic irony.</p>
<p>Right?</p>

<p>First Published: 2023 December 15</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>It’s another Friday,<a href="#fn031" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> which means it’s time for another installment in Flash Fiction Friday Fthinking.<a href="#fn032" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> The prompt this week is “A promise to break”. The prompt givers implied that it was a promise which would be broken, but that is not where my mind went.</p>
<p>I’m immediately reminded of a line in Seanan McGuire’s Middlegame, which I don’t remember perfectly, and so will not attempt to quote. The gist of the line, though, is about compelling someone to continue, rather than stop. I’m not totally sure how that reminded me of the prompt, except that I read it as a promise to break something.</p>
<p>Breaking is an inherently dynamic action, which makes it good for me, a person who struggles to have plots, especially in flash fiction. So, if we assume that there’s a promise which involves breaking, what does that require?</p>
<p>On some level, it requires two entities. I suppose that one can, in theory, make a promise to oneself, but that feels not like the story I want to tell here.</p>
<p>I’m debating between realism, fantasy, and sci fi. If scifi, there’s the option of like “when the barrier falls do X”, which is similar for fantasy. Actually, the FFF I’ve written since coming back from hiatus have all been shades of realism. Let’s lean into the fantastic, just for a day.</p>
<p>So, fantasy. What’s breaking, what’s the promise?</p>
<p>One element of fantasy I love is how binding promises are.</p>
<p>Given that it’s now very late out, I find that I want to write a sonnet to respond to the prompt, because I don’t really have the energy<a href="#fn033" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> to do a story, the rest of this blog, and muse. As I walked home, though, I ran into an issue. When I think of fantasy poetry, I think of ballads and ballad form, which is in triple meter. I am currently in a sonnet phase, which requires iambic pentameter. Still, there’s nothing saying I can’t just go for it. Will report back when finished.</p>
<p>So, it wasn’t the best sonnet that I’ve ever written, but it certainly wasn’t the worst either. All in all, I think that I’m actually pretty happy with it. I managed to tell a narrative, and that’s really what’s important.</p>
<p>Now, readers of the blog might wonder what kept me from writing all day. In order, there was a department party, a secret santa<a href="#fn034" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> reveal, a thesis defense and accompanying celebrations, and then two parties. Each lasted just a little bit longer<a href="#fn035" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> than I was expecting, but I don’t regret the time at all. Time with people is never time wasted.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I embroider today? I completely forgot to take the embroidery home. I might need to go into the office tomorrow, though, so I could pick it up then.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I play guitar today? The smallest amount. I did also play penny whistle, though, which was fun and cool, if a little embarrassing.<a href="#fn036" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Did I practice touch typing today? I need to get back to this, but not tonight.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Reading</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have I made progress on my Currently Reading Shelf? I am almost finished with the audiobook. I hope that we’re past the hardest sections, but I don’t honestly know if we are.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I read the book on craft? Shoot! Once again, the day has passed me by. For all that I have these daily reflections, I don’t know how much they actually change my day to day habits.</p></li>
<li><p>Have I read the library books? I renewed my books, which is a step in the direction of believing that I’ll read them. Maybe I have to return two books a month minus however many I read starting next month? That would make me sad but might make me read more books. At the very least, I’d decrease my bookshelf by 2 a month.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write a sonnet? Yesterday I actually liked the sonnet I wrote. Today’s was pretty decent</p></li>
<li><p>Did I revise a sonnet? Nope</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? I’m not thrilled with this, but yes.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write ahead on Jeb? Nope!</p></li>
<li><p>Letter to friends? Still no</p></li>
<li><p>Paper? I started redrafting the changes that I have to follow to make the code work in prose form.<a href="#fn037" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Wellness</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How well did I pray? Bad.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I clean my space? Yeah! It’s nicer now, which was the goal.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I spend my time well? Not really. I suppose that I’m recovering from illness, so some of that is to be expected. Still, I feel like I could have done better.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? I really fell off this train.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I exercise? See above.</p></li>
<li><p>Water? I drank so much water today. The nicest part of illness is how much it encourages me to drink water.</p></li>
</ul></li>

<h1 id="book-review-of-fundamentals-of-the-faith"><a href="book-review-fundamentals-faith.html">Book Review of Fundamentals of the Faith</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 December 14</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>I’ve officially accomplished one of my goals for the month, and I’ve finished a book from my currently reading shelf. The book is <em>Fundamentals of the Faith</em> by Peter Kreeft. It’s a just under three hundred page book of apologetics about the Catholic Faith.</p>
<p>Now, there are many ways that I approach these book reviews.<a href="#fn041" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> One piece that I feel like is a fairly common aspect of them is my explaining how I came to the book. This book, at least, has a fairly interesting story, which makes it one I want to share right now.</p>
<p>Since coming to graduate school, I’ve had the chance to meet a lot of fantastic people. Last year, I helped teach religious education, and chatted a fair amount with one of the teachers for another age group. This past year, she had discerned joining a religious order, and offered me a book of essays. Of course, when someone who radiates holiness<a href="#fn042" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> offers you a book, it seems only prudent to read it.</p>
<p>So, of course, I waited almost six months before starting the book. From the first page, though, I was hooked on it. Kreeft strikes the difficult balance between incisive wit and deep broad truth.</p>
<p>As much as I’d meant for this musing to be a long reflection on the book, it’s late enough right now that I would really rather be asleep. A few brief thoughts before that happens:</p>
<p>As a faithful Catholic, he did, of course, profess extra ecclesiam nulla salus. As a faithful Catholic, he did, of course, also point out that what we consider the Church and what the Almighty considers the Church are not always perfectly aligned. In discussing that, he also brought up the parable of the man who keeps hiring more workers to his vineyard.</p>
<p>My entire life, that parable has placed cradle Catholics<a href="#fn043" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> in the position of those hired first. Kreeft inverts that. We, as Catholics, do legitimately have an easier path to salvation<a href="#fn044" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> by virtue of knowing exactly what the Lord wants us to do and how He wants to be worshipped. It was striking to consider that, in many regards, I do have an easier time finding Truth than those outside of the faith.</p>
<p>The other most striking aspect of the book was its claim to absolute truth. As a scientist, one of the most fundamental aspects of the field is that no knowledge is certain. Everything is either theory<a href="#fn045" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> or law<a href="#fn046" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>. Nothing is inherently true, and to do science correctly requires, on some level, a willingness to find that everyone else has always been wrong.</p>
<p>In the midst of a culture that is incredibly relativist right now, the fact that Kreeft was so willing to say that not only is the Church true, but it is the Truth, was really striking to me. Also, he continually brought up the fact that the most central teaching of the Church is not being kind to our neighbors or loving G-d, or anything else like that. The most central tenant of our faith is that Jesus Christ, True G-d and True man, was incarnate and died for our sins.<a href="#fn047" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>That was something that I’ve found myself coming back to as I consider the book. For most of the modern history of the Church, it was reasonable to assume that everyone was familiar with the explicit teachings of the faith, and so we could discuss the secondary considerations. In a time before relativism, it was valuable to explain how Christianity is like other faiths, who have their own piece of the truth. Nowadays, as the normal belief is that belief systems are more alike than different, the opposite tack is needed.</p>
<p>Anyways, all this to say, I really enjoyed the book, and I feel like I should read more explicitly Catholic creative nonfiction in the next year.</p>

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>First, I want to apologize for the url for this posting.<a href="#fn051" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> As much as I do think that it is important for the urls I use to be meaningful, I have more and more begun to realize that I am not yet good at using command line, and so can only find blog posts by the beginning of their names. Since this post is about teaching crochet, it could easily be teaching-crochet. However, since I am pretty sure that I’m going to be reflecting more on the crochet than the teaching, I think that it’s worthwhile for me to have the title focus on crochet, rather than teaching.<a href="#fn052" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Anyways, today I helped teach some friends and colleagues how to crochet. I hadn’t realized quite how ingrained the muscle memory was for me, but I found that I kept needing to go far slower than I expected to explain a concept. Understanding the way that the yarn moves and needs to move to make crochet work is something that becomes intuitive, but certainly does not begin as such.</p>
<p>We were trying to make granny squares, which may not have been the best idea, in retrospect. The first fifteen or so stitches in a granny square look really ugly even if doing everything correctly, and it can be difficult to understand where mistakes arose when they inevitably do. I got to practice a little bit of classroom management, though, which was really nice.</p>

<h1 id="on-blogging"><a href="blogging.html">On Blogging</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 December12</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Wow, five years ago I was posting my theatre final for my blog post. It’s really interesting to me how much my view of this blog has changed since starting it. As Hanukkah starts to wind down,<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and the semester<a href="#fn062" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> does as well, I think it could be fun to explicitly muse on why I’m doing these musings, and why I started initially.</p>
<p>As the header for this site implies, one major reason that I write my blog is because my father does. He had his own reasons for wanting to blog, which, if I remember correctly, include wanting to leave us a legacy and wanting a space to answer questions that he frequently received. Another reason that I initially began this blog was because I wanted my friends and family to be able to keep up with my exploits and adventures while I studied abroad. I think that the only other reason that matters is that I was in a class on diaries which assigned us to keep a diary. I argued<a href="#fn063" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> that blogging is a modern form of diary, one which comes with its own benefits and drawbacks.<a href="#fn064" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Of course, I, like every writer under a commitment, then struggled to find something to write about literally every day.<a href="#fn065" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> One way that I got around this<a href="#fn066" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> was by posting my different writing assignments to the blog. In some regards, I’ve kept up with that, however slightly. These days, I tend to use the platform to iterate on ideas, but don’t actually put the text of my assignments or other writing into the blog.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>One reason is that I don’t know if I want this blog to be widely attached to my name. I’m going to keep it up indefinitely, but that doesn’t mean that I want it to be easily accessed. Right now, it’s actively not SEO<a href="#fn067" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> optimized, and there’s no direct link from the main site,<a href="#fn068" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> or even my subsection<a href="#fn069" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> of the site. It is linked on my GitHub, which a colleague pointed out. Still, I don’t think that’s too much of an issue.</p>
<p>However, the more that direct text is copied between the blog and other sources, the more that they can be tied together. My writing tumblr, for instance, is nominally anonymous. I’d really rather all of my writing stay, at least in theory, separated from my personal self.</p>
<p>Other than that, though, as I keep doing funded research, I am more and more concerned about accidentally leaking private research information or causing our research to get scooped. That’s probably a baseless concern, but it’s easier to stay in a habit of not leaking data than to have to develop it after graduate school.</p>
<p>So, what’s the point of the musings these days?</p>
<p>In part, it’s about holding myself accountable. The daily reflections I post force me to, if only for a second, go through my mental checklist of the day and see how well I did. More than that, though, the daily reflections remind me that I need to do things every day. The number of times that I’ve been getting ready to go to sleep, read something like “did I drink water today?” and then drunk water<a href="#fn0610" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> is almost embarrassingly high.</p>
<p>One portion of the original inspiration that still remains is that I do still want to be more like my father in more ways. He has<a href="#fn0611" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> a sign with the quote “no matter how tall I grow, I still look up to my father”<a href="#fn0612" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>. I know that he has his own personal relationship to the saying, and that I have mine. Honestly, I’m not sure if I’ve ever told him that the sign has meaning to me.<a href="#fn0613" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> Writing this lets me feel connected to him in a new way, which is really nice.</p>
<p>A major reason that has evolved from the original inspiration is keeping track of my life. I originally made the blog so that friends and family could theoretically feel like they knew how my hours passed. Looking back on the posts, though, I am reminded of my own memories there, especially the ones that I did not explicitly record.</p>
<p>Not finally but finally for my reflection tonight, I find that writing these musings makes me more reflective. I’ve talked a lot about how I want to improve at craft, but, as I mentioned <a href="conclusions.html">recently,</a> I also struggle with expressing why I have goals or arguments. I want to be better at the craft of writing so that I can better communicate in whatever endeavors I choose to spend my days following. I want to be better at communicating because I do, deep down, believe that I have insights and ideas that could help the world and lead people to Christ. Honing my craft allows me to be more effective at spreading whatever small scale message I want to spread, in addition to the larger meta goal.</p>
<p>For all that<a href="#fn0614" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>, being reflective is an end in itself. As my recent posts have demonstrated<a href="#fn0615" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>, my thoughts on a subject can and often do change rapidly and wildly if I take the time to verbalize<a href="#fn0616" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> them. In basically every post I’ve revised recently, the later drafts are not only more polished, but they argue something different, sometimes even contradictory to the earlier drafts. I find that my ability to sort through my thoughts is improving. Even if it were not, though, the fact that I am thinking more deeply is a goal in and of itself.</p>
<p>So, while I don’t think that I’m going to get back into the habit of posting drafts of my class assignments to this blog<a href="#fn0617" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>, I do still intend to keep writing these posts. What has this musing done to help with my goals of: being like my father, being more reflective, keeping track of my time, and keeping myself accountable?<a href="#fn0618" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> I don’t really know. Today was an uneventfully eventful day<a href="#fn0619" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>, and I<a href="#fn0620" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> don’t want to make my private life quite this public yet, and didn’t touch on any of the events that happened. I thought again about why I’m keeping up this blog, which is something that I do at least monthly, and so might not have needed to spend an entire post on.</p>
<p>Oh, I did just think of another reason that I’m writing this blog still. As I’ve mentioned a few times, there’s a site I use to motivate my writing these days. It encourages putting out a large quantity of words, and a daily blog post is a way for me to generate more words.</p>
<p>Sorry, aside aside<a href="#fn0621" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>, I do think that reflecting explicitly is still good, especially since I think that this might be the first time that I actually explicitly stated why I want to get better at writing. And, of course, there’s going to be the daily reflection at the end, which will hopefully help with the final portions.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>

<li><p>Did I embroider today? Something I embroidered was received.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I play guitar today? Still in its case from last night, will do so after I post this.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I practice touch typing today? I made it through c, if only for a lesson. H did not go well enough, and I was once more forced back last night. I do find that I’m doing better and better at using my middle finger for c, for all that<a href="#fn0622" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> I’m still not quite at perfect finger use for each letter.

<li><p>Reading</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have I made progress on my Currently Reading Shelf? I officially started one of the audiobooks, and it really is making it a lot easier to read. I don’t know why I have a mental block against reading physically right now, but it’s better to find a workaround than to suffer.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I read the book on craft? I brought it with me during my far too long drive today, expecting to have to wait outside my car. I didn’t have to, and so didn’t end up reading it.</p></li>

<h1 id="open-mic"><a href="open-mic-9.html">Open Mic</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 December11</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>I meant to write a simple accounting of my first time playing at an open mic <a href="open-mic-8.html">in a few months.</a> My muse, however, wanted to talk about the way that music feels. There is something really special in instruments that are not fixed pitch.</p>
<p>I was chatting with one of the astronomers today about the fact that they had recently acquired a piano. They were amazed at how fun it is to just play, especially when you can do so with friends or family. I don’t disagree, for all that I’m now realizing the very thing that makes piano so instantly rewarding is also what makes learning guitar so much deeper to me.</p>
<p>On a piano, there is a sense of removal from the note you are making. You press a button which activates a hammer which hits a string. There is no way to make the string slightly higher or lower with your strike. Each note is tuned to an exact specification<a href="#fn071" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. Knowing one chord shows you the hand position for most other chords, and the same is true for scales and notes. It is easy to make any sound appear, which is part of why the ceiling feels so far away from what the average person does. Not even the ceiling, honestly.</p>
<p>This could spiral off into a whole discussion about how the easier it is to make the correct sound on an instrument, the more that mastery is defined in the ability to do far more. However, I don’t want to talk about piano tonight. Instead, let us look at guitar by contrast.</p>
<p>Guitar chords are generally broken into around two categories.<a href="#fn072" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> There are open chords, where some strings ring freely while others are fretted individually by specific fingers, and there are barre chords, where a simple chord shape is moved higher up the neck by virtue of pressing the index finger to effectively raise the pitch of the instrument by half tones.</p>
<p>There are around five open chord shapes that tend to be used: C, G, D, A and E.<a href="#fn073" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> D, A, and E can all be major or minor, while C and G can only really be major.</p>
<p>When barring,<a href="#fn074" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> by contrast, most of the time only E and A shapes are used. I still find that most barre chords sound more or less the same, as they have the same quality of all strings being fretted.</p>
<p>The five-ish open chords, by contrast, each have their own unique sound profile.<a href="#fn075" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> At tonight’s open mic, one of the songs I did was in E minor, and really spent most of its time there. There’s something really magical about the E minor chord, for all that I don’t really use it in that way normally.</p>
<p>I’ve noticed that with many instruments, the lowest note that they can reasonably play is a little more powerful than the rest. On cello, when playing the open C string, the entire instrument seems to vibrate. On guitar, every string shares some resonance with the low E string. If you pluck and silence it, the upper two strings will continue sounding, since they lie exactly on its harmonic series.</p>
<p>E minor is also the triad that requires the fewest alterations from the way that the guitar is tuned. As someone who’s started to explore DADGAD and other open tunings, there is something really inspiring about a droning note and open guitar strings. With E minor, you get both the benefit of many open strings and the benefit of having the lowest note sounding.</p>
<p>Just by altering which strings you emphasize on strokes, the sound can go from dark and brooding to an almost angry beat, like something calling warriors to arms. I hope that I remember this as I start writing music again, because I think that there’s absolutely a place in my album for a driven beat song.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I embroider today? Somehow my needle ended up on top of my coat, which might have been a sign that I was supposed to do some embroidery today. I ignored that, and forgot.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I play guitar today? I even played in public! It was so fun, and I need to do it again.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I practice touch typing today? Oof, C remains my white whale. Given that I’ve finished this musing well before my candles have burned down, though, I think that I might spend some time working on it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Reading</p>

<li><p>Have I made progress on my Currently Reading Shelf? I’ve got a lot of driving tomorrow, so plenty of time to do the audiobooks then.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I read the book on craft? I might have time tomorrow.</p></li>
<li><p>Have I read the library books? Having too many goals is a bad idea for me.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write a sonnet? Will do now.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I revise a sonnet? Ended up cancelling the writer’s session, because the other member didn’t have time o write a sonnet, too busy working on a paper.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? I like it.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write ahead on Jeb? I caught up to where I needed to be. Tomorrow I get to write a fun chapter again, though, which is nice.</p></li>
<li><p>Letter to friends? See the goal of reading library books.</p></li>
<li><p>Paper? I realized that the approach I was using is fundamentally flawed when I extend the problem like I’m currently trying to do.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Wellness</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How well did I pray? Not good.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I clean my space? Infinitesimally.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I spend my time well? Eh, I think that I could have spent it better, but I certainly spent it better than I have been recently.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? Still no.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I exercise? Shoot!</p></li>
<li><p>Water? Completely spaced drinking water for much of today. Remembered to drink a fair amount before the open mic though.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Well, time always passes. Somehow, it’s been <a href="open-mic-8.html">just over 4 months</a> since the last time that I went to an open mic. Some might be asking why, a mere ten days before the longest night of the year, I chose to play there again.</p>
<p>This past Saturday, I was at the bar for an unrelated reason, and the waiter mentioned that the open mics had moved to be much earlier. One reason that I had stopped going was the fact that I generally try to get to bed somewhere around 9 most nights, and the open mic did not start before then. As a result, I was forced to choose between playing in public and getting sleep. Nowadays, though, the open mic has been moved to start closer to seven or eight, depending on the week. That in mind, I showed up very early, had a few tacos, and then played a set.</p>
<p>I wish that I could say the entire set went flawlessly. Or, failing that, I wish that I could say something went so terribly wrong that I can tell stories about it for ages to come. Alas, neither happened. My guitar wasn’t getting picked up, for whatever reason<a href="#fn076" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>, and so I had a brief moment of panic. Thankfully, the man who runs the open mics lent me his guitar, and I was off to go.</p>
<p>I started with an original.<a href="#fn077" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Ashes went really well, and I didn’t miss the intro to the chorus like I tend to. Still, applause was somewhat muted for it.</p>
<p>Since it’s been a while since my last open mic<a href="#fn078" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>, I went with a great standby and did Maid on the Shore. I really started to get into my stride during that song, and I saw at least a few people tapping along to the song, which is always nice. The emcee<a href="#fn079" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> said that I had time for one more song, and I knew just what to do. It’s nearly Christmas, so I did one of my favorite Advent/ Christmas songs, The Angel Gabriel.<a href="#fn0710" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> It went well, though the fact that I was playing it on a different guitar than normal meant that it did not go quite as well as normal. Still, it was really fun, and I got even more applause for my final song. A few people complimented me after my set, which is always nice.</p>
<p>I forgot how much more fun guitar is with fresh strings. I just put them on yesterday, and it’s amazing how much better the tone is, and how much better my fingers seem to move. More than that, though, it is as though the guitar pulls more sound out of my voice.</p>
<p>In general, I have noticed that I’m starting to like my singing voice more lately. I think that a lot of it is because of an off handed comment that my choir director made. He said that in one of the songs we did, we should really lean into the baritone growl. I had forgotten about that vocal register, and I do really think that it’s where my tone is best, at least from the inside. Given that the open mic plays the amp slightly back at the performer, though, I do think that it also sounds at least a little better from the outside.</p>
<p>I forgot how much I love the E minor chord on the guitar. There’s something really nice about being able to just drone on the low string, bass sound droning as your own voice melds into the tone. The sound becomes almost rhythmic, starting to sound less like a pitch and more like a pitched percussion. Then, just when the note feels like the only sound that your guitar could make, you change chords.</p>
<p>The A minor chord that follows suddenly feels electric. The energy rises, and you barre<a href="#fn0711" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> up to B minor. As you reach the peak of the line, the rhythmic low E drone comes back, and you’ve returned to E minor. All that to say, I really love the setting of The Angel Gabriel I found. It was originally in the key of A minor, but I transposed it down a fifth to E minor.</p>
<p>I’m more and more understanding what a visiting composer once told me. He said that every interval has a particular emotion attached to it. While I don’t know if I’ll ever get there, or even get to the point of specific keys having feelings on fixed pitch instruments like harp or piano, I’m starting to get there on guitar.</p>
<p>E minor, as mentioned, feels resonant and droning. The fact that only two notes are fretted, and both are fretted to octaves of notes that are already sounded probably helps a lot.</p>
<p>E major, by contrast, feels aggressive and intense. It’s the sound of beating drums, striving and preparing for a fight.</p>
<p>G major feels open. It reminds me of the open prairie as a lone voice sings about the stark beauty of the land.</p>
<p>C major is hopefully happy. It is the sound of a young protest singer, one who still believes in his country.</p>
<p>A minor is not melancholy, for all that the word almost fits. It is not quite bittersweet. It’s the ache of absence, the pain that comes only because of a joy that has been taken.</p>
<p>D major uplifts. It reminds the listener that there’s something they need to be moving towards.<a href="#fn0712" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>All this to say, I think that the music I write needs to start focusing on E minor for the more intense portions, because there’s an intensity to the low open E that I just cannot match with the other chords.</p>

<h1 id="reflections-on-todays-gospel"><a href="reflections-on-readings-2-advent-b-23.html">Reflections on Today’s Gospel</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 December 10</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>I know that I try to have a deep and meaningful<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> reflection about the Gospel each week, but I find that my mind isn’t really catching on any of the many available hooks that the readings are filled with. As seems to be my custom, there is a part of the reading that I struggle with.</p>
<p>In the first reading, we hear the Prophet Isaiah say that a voice cries out to prepare a way in the desert.<a href="#fn082" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> In the Gospel, however, we are told that the Prophet Isaiah says that a voice in the desert cries out.<a href="#fn083" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Interestingly, both happen in the third verse of the chapter, for all that the first happens in the fortieth chapter and the other in the first chapter.</p>
<p>Now, what about this bothers me, especially as a person who knows that ancient languages had a much different approach to punctuation than modern people do? Primarily, it’s the fact that if there was no punctuation, we<a href="#fn084" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> could have made the two line up. But, we didn’t.</p>
<p>I’m sure that there’s some deep spiritual meaning for this, for all that I cannot find it. The commentary on the USCCB website notes that, despite claiming to be a direct quote from Isaiah, there are references to other prophets’ prophesies.<a href="#fn085" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>So, let’s take the readings where I’m at today. The first reading reminds us that struggles are both temporary and meant as purification. Any hardship we endure now is either to cleanse us from some past wrong or<a href="#fn086" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> to prepare us for some future glory.</p>
<p>One part I find interesting is the idea that the geography of the world is something less than perfect. There is a heresy that became popular near the Enlightenment<a href="#fn087" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> known as the Watchmaker G-d. This heresy states that, much like a watchmaker, who carefully sets gears and winds a watch before stepping away, the Lord created the universe, along with all of its laws, and then stepped back to watch and see what happened.</p>
<p>Of course, as a scientist, I believe something similar. As a Catholic, though, there is room for nuance, which I find very important. So, where’s the nuance?</p>
<p>First, an obvious contradiction to the Watchmaker<a href="#fn088" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> is the existence of miracles. The water turning into wine or Our Lord’s rising from the dead cannot happen without active intervention. Even in the modern day, miracles are still performed wherever the Lord sees that it would most help the faithful.<a href="#fn089" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> It goes deeper than that, though.</p>
<p>One thing that the Watchmaker heresy implies, however accidentally, is the preexistence of nature. A watchmaker does not conjure the gears and hands of a watch from the formless void. He may shape them from metal, but even the ore he gets comes from some other cause. In contrast, the Lord created the universe from nothing.</p>
<p>So, it’s an imperfect metaphor at best. All metaphors are, which is why they’re symbolic rather than literal. What else is wrong with the Watchmaker?</p>
<p>The crucial issue in the Watchmaker heresy is the idea that the Lord stopped. When a watchmaker finishes his work, the watch is done, and he can sell it or give it away. Without the Lord constantly willing reality to remain, we would cease. At every moment of every day, we are sustained and continued solely through Love. Our Creator is not some dispassionate worker toiling for His pay. Our Creator made us with Love, from Love, and for Love.</p>
<p>Returning to the readings, we see an oblique reference to this in a letter from the first Pope. St. Peter reminds us that, though we experience life in something resembling a linear fashion<a href="#fn0810" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>, the Lord does not. For Him who is outside of time, everything happens as it should. It is a hard concept to imagine, for all that I know that it’s essential for mathematicians, who often visualize high dimensional spaces.</p>
<p>I’m reminded of a movie<a href="#fn0811" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> called Flatland. In it, a two dimensional creature is exposed to the concept of three dimensions, in part by seeing zero and one dimensional existence. Thinking of it like that helps me resolve the whole “how does Free Will work when G-d knows every thought I’ve had before I have it?” How, exactly, it works with miracles or the Divine Revelation, which explicitly happened to a specific people at a specific time, though, remains a mystery. For all that I can trust that it is true, I would not be able to give a reasoned defense should that be someone’s stumbling block to joining the Church.</p>
<p>So, where are we? The readings appear to contradict themselves, for all that I know that any punctuation we add is a modern decision. The universe is not a machine created by someone thoughtless, but a treasured love of Love Himself. Time is an illusion, albeit one we are bound to.</p>
<p>I feel that this is as good a place as any to end.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I embroider today? Remains at work, and I’m ok with that fact.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I play guitar today? I replaced the strings! It’s always wild to me how much of the upper end I lose when the strings get old, but also how much I kind of prefer my strings to not have particularly high overtones.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I practice touch typing today? A few lessons, and I managed to work my way back up to the letter c, for all that I didn’t manage to beat or even improve it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Reading</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have I made progress on my Currently Reading Shelf? I realized that I’m listening to a lot of audiobooks recently, and there’s no reason that I can’t read some of the books I want to have read via audio means. Checked out the two that seemed available from my local libraries, and put a third on hold, I think.<a href="#fn0812" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Did I read the book on craft? Tomorrow is always a day away.</p></li>
<li><p>Have I read the library books? see above.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write a sonnet? Whoops! Almost forgot.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I revise a sonnet? Have made ideas for what poem(s) I’ll bring to the thing tomorrow.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? I almost forgot to do the reflection, but yes!</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write ahead on Jeb? I broke the no Jeb on Sunday rule, writing about a third of a chapter.</p></li>
<li><p>Letter to friends? Considered the fact that I should write some, which is in a way kind of something resembling progress.</p></li>
<li><p>Paper? Without any guilt, I can say that I took the Lord’s day to rest.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Wellness</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How well did I pray? Not the best but not the worst. I wrote most of this musing by the light of Hanukkah candles, which have only now extinguished themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I clean my space? A tiny bit.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I spend my time well? Kind of? I took a nap which, while needed, always feels like it takes the entire day away.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? Nope! Got a shoulder massage, though, which is similar enough.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I exercise? Took the day off, because rest is important, probably.</p></li>
<li><p>Water? As happens on Sunday, I did much better in the morning because of singing, and then stopped.</p></li>

<h1 id="on-editing"><a href="editing.html">On Editing</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 December 9</p>
<h1 id="draft-3">Draft 3</h1>
<p>Irish legend says that the airs<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> to the most striking and memorable Irish folk songs were not composed, but discovered. Considering it that way, editing makes far more sense.</p>
<p>If what I write is not, in fact, a creation but a discovery, then editing makes complete sense. The words on the page are not the discovery, but my pale imitation of them. Like a sculptor with clay, I can remove or add material, shifting it as I need until I reach the shape that I see in my vision.</p>
<p>For all that I can imagine my writing as that, I tend not to. It feels a little too pretentious to say that the fun web serial I write about a boy wandering through life is some profound gift from the cosmos.<a href="#fn092" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> I tend to think of my writing as the words that I put on a page.</p>
<p>When I think of writing in that way, editing becomes something hard. Deleting words is exactly destroying something I’ve created. Adding words is grafting something onto a creation.</p>
<p>As I’ve mused about editing over these past drafts, my own feelings on the art have changed. I think that my issue with editing stems directly from the fact that I consider the writing to be the action, rather than the mode of transportation. My goal is not to put specific words on a page, but to convey a narrative.</p>
<p>Of course, that becomes an issue of its own. If I do not know what narrative I’m trying to convey, how can I know which words belong? There are some obvious choices, such as avoiding cliche. Even if I know what I’m trying to convey, I also need to take a step even further back to consider why I’m trying to convey what I’m trying to say, and why via writing. Doing that takes far more mental effort than simply dumping words on a page and seeing where the story takes me.</p>
<p>And, I do not dislike the places that the story and my mind, less strictly filtered, tend to roam. I suppose that there’s something to be said for shaping what I have. When I see a piece of wood that kind of resembles a tiger, carving it to make it more closely resemble that shape is an obvious choice.</p>
<p>And so, I suppose that the answer has been in front of me this entire time. To become better at editing, I need to become better at divorcing my art from myself as artist. I need to see what I create as nothing but how well it communicates what I want it to say and who I want to say it to. If my goals have changed between drafts, it’s only reasonable that the words and structure would need to as well.<a href="#fn093" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Daily Reflection:</p>

<li><p>Did I embroider today? It’s still at work, so no, not so much.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I play guitar today? A little, I plan to do a little more after posting this because it turns out the place I used to play open mic at shifted the time earlier, so now I can actually go again.<a href="#fn094" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>

<li><p>Did I blog? I mused no less! Look at this abomination.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write ahead on Jeb? I’m tired right now. I’m going to break my no Jeb on Sundays rule because I don’t want the panic of needing to write a chapter on Monday morning, and I don’t have the space to do it right now.</p></li>

<li><p>Did I clean my space? A tad.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I spend my time well? The parts of today that were spent with others, yes. The rest of the day, not so much. I suppose that the time I’ve spent on this musing is time well spent.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? A little!</p></li>
<li><p>Did I exercise? I went to the gym with a friend, and that was really nice.</p></li>

<h1 id="draft-2.1-started-a-sentence-that-went-too-long">Draft 2.1 Started a sentence that went too long</h1>
<p>If we take a moment to imagine writing not as creating, exercising some small sliver of the Divine in what we do, and instead consider it like the early Irish considered song: something found.</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>I find it kind of funny that what really seems to separate the mediocre writers from the good writers from the great writers is not writing. Having listened to early versions of Piano Man, it is nothing like the final song that was released. Terry Pratchett famously rewrote his books over and over until each word was what he wanted. Editing is what separates the bad from the good writers.</p>
<p>It’s obvious once stated, of course. No one creates perfection constantly without needing to toss away words that don’t fit, or redirect a thought that’s strayed a little too far. However, it does feel strange that there is an entire art, editing, which is so vital to proper writing.</p>
<p>I think of the different activities that I do a lot.<a href="#fn095" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> It’s a bit of an issue, because there isn’t really a way that editing is like anything except itself.</p>
<p>In music, I do occasionally delete lines that I’ve written. Of course, that is also editing. Playing music, however, I never unplay a note.</p>
<p>In reading, I can never forget having read a word. In fact, doing so would be actively harmful towards my ability to understand a text.</p>
<p>In cooking, ingredients don’t get separated once combined.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s why I have such trouble with editing. Probably because I analogize my different crafts so much, it’s become easier and easier for me to do so.</p>
<p>Working off of a recipe is like reading sheet music. Improvising a song is like trying a crochet project off of vague feelings. Writing something is like cooking a meal. Even when constrained, I have some freedom in what I choose to do.</p>
<p>What is editing like?</p>
<p>Editing is like trimming the fat off of a roast before cooking, so that you don’t have to deal with silver skin. But, you don’t add more meat<a href="#fn096" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Editing is like practicing a difficult section of music until it flows. But, you don’t remove difficult notes<a href="#fn097" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> when they don’t feel right, you play until they do.</p>
<p>Editing is like revising a pattern. Sure, that’s true, but that’s like saying the sky is like the air.</p>
<p>Of course, at this point, I kind of feel like I’m in a shifting goalposts meets no true scotsman land. If it feels like editing in a skill, I lump it into the craft of editing. Otherwise, whatever it is clearly is not editing.</p>
<p>This doesn’t even get into the whole issue of what the difference is between revising and editing and redrafting.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>One of the hardest parts of writing is editing. It, like so much of life, requires balance and precision. Encouraging the voice in your head to edit too much or too quickly, and I<a href="#fn098" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> find that it becomes nearly impossible to get anything down onto the page. On the other hand, I do know that it is an essential skill to develop. For all that my ability to write words well on the first attempt continues to grow, it has not made the writing I put out as much better.</p>
<p>A great analogy comes from music.<a href="#fn099" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Some might think that I’m going to say that writing is like writing music and revising is like revising music. That would be fun, but no.</p>
<p>Writing, generating new content, is like sight reading. It’s one of the most impressive things to do in front of someone, and in many respects, it is crucial to development as an artist. To become better at sight reading, the first thing to do is just try sight reading.</p>
<p>This gets its own analogy.<a href="#fn0910" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> I’ve seen a lot of lifting advice on the internet, describing exactly how best to optimize every second of one’s life around the gym. However, one piece of advice has stuck with me.</p>
<p>If you’re just starting lifting, as long as what you do is not actively wrong, it’s going to be more or less as effective as any other workout. Whether one should squat or leg press is a valid question, but if you do not have a history of lifting, doing either will help a lot. Only once plateauing does it really matter exactly how many reps and of what weight for how many sets on what workout you do.</p>
<p>Music is a similar way. For most people, the best way to get better at sight reading is to sight read. Honestly, for most people, the best way to get better at music is just to make music. I’ve blogged about that <a href="how-i-practice.html">before</a>, though it has been almost five years. My relationship with practice has changed a fair amount, which is probably fair, given that I no longer study music as an explicit part of my studies.</p>
<p>Anyways, I know without a doubt that I am past that point as a musician generally, for all that I am not past that point on every instrument.<a href="#fn0911" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> At this point, the way that I grow as a musician is by working on skills, and working intentionally. If we tie this directly to sight reading, I’m at the point in my musical career where I would benefit a lot from just practicing scales and common chord progressions, since that’s the basis of most compositions, and therefore makes it easier to sight read.</p>
<p>An, returning to the real point of this musing, right now I know that, while continuing to generate new words will still help me incrementally, right now I need to really focus on my craft. Now, there are a few ways that I’m trying to do so.</p>
<p>First, I’m trying to remember sensory cues as I write my fiction. I know that, among all of the many ways that my writing is lacking, that is the one that I am most prone to.</p>
<p>Second, I’m writing more poetry again. That, at a base level, forces me to remember how to construct a narrative in a limited number of words. It also makes me incredibly aware of the specific cadence of the words that I use, as well as their ability to rhyme. Though rhyming may not be incredibly necessary to my prose writing, cadence certainly is.</p>
<p>Third, as you might have noticed, I’m editing my writing more. I think that I might be starting to go too far, if my FFF from <a href="flash-fiction-230.html">yesterday</a> is any indication. I tried to start the story at least a dozen times, giving up within a few sentences.</p>
<p>Then again, a voice reminds me right now, none of the first dozen ways that I wanted to start a story were where I ended up. I took a few cute phrases or images from the first sentences into the next one. I am still worried that I’m getting to the point of writer’s block again, my internal editor shutting down any prose I try to write.</p>
<p>I’m reminded of some advice from the creator of NaNoWriMo. They recommend hiding your internal editor for the month, accepting that whatever you write may or may not be absolute garbage. I manage to do that, maybe too well.</p>
<p>However, there is a time for planting, and a time for harvesting. There is also, crucially in nearly every gardening book I’ve read<a href="#fn0912" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>, a time for weeding, and a time to decide what you want to plant. As a writer, finding time to write is not the biggest struggle for me. It’s important to me, and I’ve gotten better about prioritizing it and not feeling guilty for doing so.</p>
<p>As a writer, finding opportunities to share my writing hasn’t been particularly difficult. I have my web serial, which lots of people seem to enjoy, and I have a few friends who read my blog and sonnets. That’s most of the writing I do, and it’s nice that it finds a home.</p>
<p>The time to decide what to write isn’t even something I really struggle with. For all that I often enough have trouble coming up with a musing idea, that’s never a problem that lasts more than like 4 minutes of trying to write something. At a step higher, I know that I need to write my web serial, my blog, and my sonnets.</p>
<p>And, while I could strain the metaphor further, talking about soil pH and making sure that you plant proper plants where they will receive ideal sunlight, to say nothing about seasonal considerations<a href="#fn0913" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>, I will instead keep the metaphor relatively plain. Part of weeding, at least the way it exists in my mind, is also pruning. A fruit tree will grow more fruit, somehow, when its branches are effectively pruned. In theory, the same is true of writing.</p>
<p>Deleting words can make the sentence clearer, and can make what you are trying to say clearer. The book on writing well<a href="#fn0914" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> that I’m reading does focus on that a lot. The point of writing is connection. If the words you wrote do not serve to convey what you are trying to say, then they must go, just like the beautiful rosebud that needs to be snipped because it’s out of alignment.</p>
<p>So, why am I concerned? Well, if editing is like pruning<a href="#fn0915" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>, then right now I’m worried that I might start pruning too far. The work might start to falter, unable to get the nutrients it needs.<a href="#fn0916" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
