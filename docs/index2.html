<p>The Lenten Season has begun, and with it the change of emotion for the readings. This Gospel has been interesting to me since I learned that Satan in the Old Testament is not a rebel angel, but one of the faithful.<a href="#fn011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> It causes me to wonder a bit whether the temptations that our Lord receives are from the Betrayer or from a loyal angel simply doing his job. In the end, it doesn’t really matter, because our Lord resists the temptations, even while starving.</p>
<p>I don’t know if I could stop myself from making bread from stones if I had fasted for a day, let alone forty. We are called to be more like Christ in every way, and self-denial is definitely somewhere I can improve.</p>

<p>First Published: 2022 March 5</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p><a href="quick-post">Yesterday</a> I mentioned that I had an idea for the blog post today. As is too often the case, the ideas I had late at night while half asleep didn’t seem so nice in the light of day.</p>
<p>I was going to blog about, as mentioned bagpipes in funerals, which is a thought that I’ve had for a few years. As I started to talk my way through the post, though<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I realized that the way I wanted to express the idea in many respects cheapened the idea. So, instead I get to meta-blog about how I write nowadays.</p>
<p>I was finding this week that I lacked the motivation and direction to keep writing my story. For a few days I thought it might be that I was just tired of writing, but as I started this weekend, I realized it’s that I haven’t given my mind time to process the story.</p>
<p>I spent about half an hour before bed two nights ago thinking about where the story could go, and when I went to write the story again, the words started flowing out. I guess it’s a good reminder that my mind needs time to sit and think without external stimuli, or at least without mental stimuli. Walking without music or praying has also worked for me, as does driving without music. In the future I should try scheduling more time for silent thought.</p>

<p>This week I will be smart and read the chapter to try to respond to the questions at the back, rather than freeform note-taking while I read<a href="#fn041" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<ol>

</ol>
<p>I think it might be helpful for me to try answering these questions both before and while/after reading the chapter, so that I can see how well my starting assumptions/things I have learned in the past line up with what the book claims.</p>
<p>So, my starting guesses as answers:</p>
<ol>
<li><ul>
<li><p>What is the meaning of “a being”?</p>
<p>My guess from the little bits of Thomistic/Scholastic Metaphysics that I’ve done is that a being is made up of the potential and action, so what they can become versus what they are.</p></li>
<li><p>What are its two distinct but inseparable elements?</p>
<p>Whoops, I assume same answer here.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><ul>
<li><p>How can we reach explicit reflective awareness of the “is” in being?</p>
<p>We can’t. We can approximate it though.</p></li>
<li><p>Do all metaphysical systems agree on this focus on actual existence as the central core of all real beings?</p>
<p>No, because lots of metaphysical systems explicitly disbelieve in actual existence</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><ul>
<li><p>What is meant by the “vocation of human beings” as endowed with intellect arising from the relation of intellect to being?</p>
<p>I have no clue what this is asking, I’m excited to find out.</p></li>
<li><p>In what sense can being still remain a “mystery” for us?</p>
<p>We cannot know the full reality of life.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><ul>
<li><p>Explain the difference between “real being” and “mental being”?</p>
<p>I have literally no idea, once again.</p></li>
<li><p>Examples of each?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><ul>
<li><p>Explain the fundamental importance of action as the self-manifestation of being if we are to have a “universe”?</p>
<p>Without action, there is no way to have a universe, which is inherently in action.</p></li>
<li><p>Could there be at least one completely inactive being?</p>
<p>Logically: yes, if there can be a being with only action, then there should be one with no action. Practically: no because then it is not a thing.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><ul>
<li><p>Finite (all limited, created) real beings go out of themselves to relate themselves to others through action for two reasons: what are they?</p>
<p>Desire to know themselves. Desire to understand the Divine.</p></li>
<li><p>Does it make sense to speak, as Maritain does, of “the intrinsic generosity of being”?</p>
<p>Absolutely!<a href="#fn042" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><ul>
<li><p>In the philosophical vision of St. Thomas, action is the key to a realist epistemology, or theory of knowledge. Why?</p>
<p>Without action there is no way to interconvert.</p></li>
<li><p>Why can it then be called a “relational realism”?</p>
<p>Great question, thank you for asking.<a href="#fn043" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Why does it also follow from this vantage point that all our human knowledge of real beings (at least in this life) must be incomplete, imperfect?</p>
<p>Without being able to fully understand the relational aspects of something, there is no way to get perfect or complete knowledge.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><ul>
<li><p>Why in this book do we take the person as the best model for what it means to be a real being?</p>
<p>Thomas does.</p></li>
<li><p>Compare briefly the ancient, medieval, and modern approaches to the philosophical study of being.</p>
<p>Nope.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><ul>
<li><p>What is the point of choosing interpersonal dialogue as the preferred starting point for a metaphysical study of being?</p>
<p>Because Kant does not.</p></li>
<li><p>Why is it especially effective in refuting Kant’s attempt to block access to any realist theory of knowledge or metaphysics?</p>
<p>Kant assumes that we cannot know anything but ourselves, so starting with the knowledge that other people’s existence has meaning defeats it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Time to read!</p>
<ol>
<li><ul>
<li><p>What is the meaning of “a being”?</p>
<p>Something which is. More precisely, that which is.</p></li>
<li><p>What are its two distinct but inseparable elements?</p>
<p>is, which is the fact of existence and essence. Or, the fact and the substance? Is meaning that it is, and that which meaning what it is.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><ul>
<li><p>How can we reach explicit reflective awareness of the “is” in being?</p>
<p>Explicit reflective awareness refers to the fact that it is a wonderful mystery that things are at all, let alone what they are. There are two approaches that the author suggests.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Downward exploration, where we seek deeper and more fundamental facts about a thing.</p></li>
<li><p>Outward exploration, where we seek to connect every thing to every other thing until we have a universe within our thoughts. I think at least, I am not totally sure what the goal is in outward exploration.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Do all metaphysical systems agree on this focus on actual existence as the central core of all real beings?</p>
<p>Nope. In many systems, the term being means limited essence or form, which means that the Divine, which exists outside of a bound form, must not be in existence. Since St. Thomas posits that existence in itself is the basis of being, the Divine fits within the meaning, and therefore actual existence treats all real beings.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><ul>
<li><p>What is meant by the “vocation of human beings” as endowed with intellect arising from the relation of intellect to being?</p>
<p>Our fundamental calling is to illuminate the universe and bring the unknown into the known.</p></li>
<li><p>In what sense can being still remain a “mystery” for us?</p>
<p>It kind of just felt like he said that was true without an argument, but it isn’t a particularly difficult concept for me. Human knowledge is inherently incomplete.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><ul>
<li><p>Explain the difference between “real being” and “mental being”?</p>
<p>Real beings exist. That is, they do not only exist in thought. E.g. being kind, being a man. Real beings can generate mental beings, but the reverse is not true.</p>
<p>Mental beings, by contrast, are only real as ideas, such as the past, future, dreams, abstractions, math, and conceptions of absence.</p></li>
<li><p>Examples of each?</p>
<p>See above.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><ul>
<li><p>Explain the fundamental importance of action as the self-manifestation of being if we are to have a “universe”?</p>
<p>St. Thomas believes that action is the primary distinguisher between the real and mental being. Additionally, it is only through action that real beings interact with each other, allowing the vocation of knowing to take place.</p></li>
<li><p>Could there be at least one completely inactive being?</p>
<p>Well, a mental being almost certainly. As a real being, there is no “practical” difference between that and no being. Therefore, it is equivalent to no being.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><ul>
<li><p>Finite (all limited, created) real beings go out of themselves to relate themselves to others through action for two reasons: what are they?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We are poor in that we are limited and imperfect</p></li>
<li><p>We are rich in that we exist and can share this imperfect knowledge with others</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Does it make sense to speak, as Maritain does, of “the intrinsic generosity of being”?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so. Especially if we agree with the concept of our vocation, there is an inherent need to connect.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><ul>
<li><p>In the philosophical vision of St. Thomas, action is the key to a realist epistemology, or theory of knowledge. Why?</p>
<p>We can only see things in the way that we interact as actors. As a result, there is no way to know without interaction. Additionally, action inherently reveals essence, and so provides knowledge.</p></li>
<li><p>Why can it then be called a “relational realism”?</p>
<p>Since we are seeing action as springing from essence, rather than essence itself, we can only learn through relation.</p></li>
<li><p>Why does it also follow from this vantage point that all our human knowledge of real beings (at least in this life) must be incomplete, imperfect?</p>
<p>Since we cannot see essence itself, we can only learn as through a veil. Additionally, no single act can fully express the nature of a finite being, and we cannot observe all things, both because of physical and mental blocks.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><ul>
<li><p>Why in this book do we take the person as the best model for what it means to be a real being?</p>
<p>I mean, in part because Aristotle did and our metaphysics grows from his. However, the argument is that, while our modern collective metaphysics may overprioritize the subjective experience, there is something integral to individual experience. That being said, there is still a concept that we as people share certain traits, and so the person balances these two, the subjective and objective.</p></li>
<li><p>Compare briefly the ancient, medieval, and modern approaches to the philosophical study of being.</p>
<p>The ancient focuses on the objective, ignoring the person. The medieval focuses on the centrality of shared human experience, the We. The modern focuses on the centrality of individual human experience, the I.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><ul>
<li><p>What is the point of choosing interpersonal dialogue as the preferred starting point for a metaphysical study of being?</p>
<p>Sharing the agreement of a faith-friendly view like Thomistic metaphysics is a harder hurdle than the acceptance of knowledge through relation with other humans.</p></li>
<li><p>Why is it especially effective in refuting Kant’s attempt to block access to any realist theory of knowledge or metaphysics?</p>
<p>Since we can communicate, there is an inherent contradiction to Kantian philosophy? I’m a little lost about what Kant argues, so a rebuttal of his argument doesn’t really help me that much.</p></li>

<h1 id="on-fasting"><a href="fasting.html">On Fasting</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 February 23</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today is Ash Wednesday, which is a traditional day of fasting in the Catholic Church.<a href="#fn051" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Additionally, the Pope dedicated today as a day of fasting and prayer for peace in Ukraine. So, I found myself fasting today.</p>
<p>Something major that I’ve noticed about my fasting self is that I struggle to focus far more. I guess less so I struggle to focus and moreso that I struggle to begin working. Once I start working, I have been able to finish at least as much as normal, though maybe at a slower rate.</p>
<p>This gives me some interesting knowledge. Apparently if I am feeling unfocused and hazy in the future I should consider whether I’ve eaten enough recently.</p>
<p>Moving past my own experience of how fasting is less than ideal<a href="#fn052" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> for my work life<a href="#fn053" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, I do think that fasting helps me refocus my days. I haven’t done as good of a job today recentering myself when I feel hungry on faith, and I think that’s something that I can work about in the future. That’s something I could work on in the future I think, and it would probably make my life better for doing so.</p>

<p>New monthly reflection!</p>
<p>My goals were:</p>

<li><p>Blog daily</p></li>
<li><p>Compose a poem and music daily</p></li>
<li><p>Do the pushup/squat thing daily</p></li>
<li><p>Listen to BiaY Daily</p></li>
<li><p>Track my daily doings better in my journal</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I think I made a blog every day which was great. I composed maybe five or ten days, which is still progress I think. I gave up on the pushup/squats, but I restarted yesterday! I listened maybe half the days in BiaY. I think I just entirely gave up on the journal.</p>
<p>So, apparently bad goals. New goals for the month of March:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Blog daily. I think this is still a helpful thing for me to do</p></li>
<li><p>Write music or poetry daily. I would like to do this, even if it is hard</p></li>
<li><p>Do the pushup/squat thing and stretch daily. I liked how I felt when I did this</p></li>
<li><p>Listen to BiaY Daily. I like making progress on it.</p></li>
<li><p>Reach 50000 words in my book. I’m currently at more than 20K, so this should be very doable.</p></li>

<p>That seems pretty decent!</p>

<h1 id="reflections-on-todays-gospel"><a href="reflections-on-readings-8-ordinary-c-22.html">Reflections on Today’s Gospel</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 February 27</p>
<p>Lule 6:44A “For every tree is known by its own fruit.”</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today is the last Sunday before Lent. I find the readings, and especially their connection, really powerful as we approach this next Liturgical phase.</p>
<p>The Gospel tells us that “A good tree does not bear rotten fruit, nor does a rotten tree bear good fruit. For every tree is known by its own fruit. For people do not pick figs from thornbushes, nor do they gather grapes from brambles.”<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> We are also told in the First Reading that “The fruit of a tree shows the care it has had,”<a href="#fn082" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> From these two lines, I at least see that we see the care of a tree making it good or rotten.</p>
<p>When taking care of a tree, it feels tempting to give it more and constant sunshine, since that’s where its energy comes from. But, the nighttime is also essential to the growth of a tree. Night is when a plant does much of its growing apparently<a href="#fn083" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, and it is essential to their growth and flowering. So, too, are the different periods in the Liturgical Year essential to our growth in faith.</p>
<p>A tree grows in the sunshine because it has the energy there and immediately available to grow. So too, do we grow in our days of feasting, seeing the Lord in his joy and goodness. But, at night time a tree grows to find the sunlight again. So too, do we grow in our days of fasting as we think on the many blessings we have been given, far in excess of what we deserve.</p>
<p>The homily I heard tonight made the claim that focusing on fixing temporal ills is ultimately meaningless, because the world will end.<a href="#fn084" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> In the example, a man brings about world peace and dies, feeling satisfied. Two years later, an asteroid destroys the earth. The priest’s claim was that this shows the meaningless of earthly accomplishments, because everything he did was undone in a few years. I took the opposite message away, though. For the two years after his death, there was no hunger pulling people from Christ, no war ending lives needlessly. Even one moment free of needless hardship for one person makes temporal good worth it to me.</p>

<p>Today as I tried to write this post I felt a different sort of writer’s block than the <a href="writers-block.html">other</a> <a href="writers-block-2.html">two</a> times that I’ve had it for the blog. In both of those cases, I felt as though I had no ideas for what to write.</p>
<p>Today, that does not feel true for me. I have a couple of ideas for posts I could write, but they don’t feel like they belong here.</p>
<p>I read through an <a href="silly-putty-and-pitch.html">old post</a> where I mentioned that I might want to write a musical piece featuring silly putty. I’m sure that writing about that could be interesting, but I don’t have silly putty with me to write the post. My group did all get slime for Valentine’s Day, so I guess I’m now within easy access of that, though I no longer plan to write that piece.</p>
<p>I thought about writing about the way my life is different than how I think of it. I never really consciously chose to move away from music in the way that I have, so it makes me really sad that music has become such a<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> small part of my life. Thoughts have yet to percolate enough in my mind for the coffee of that idea to be worth drinking.<a href="#fn092" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>I thought about reflecting on the way that I very much did not follow what I said I would do at the end of January, but that should really wait for the end of month reflection.</p>
<p>Finally, I thought about another update on the book I’m writing, but not a lot has really changed there, and I don’t really like this blog being a commentary on that writing as I do it. So, despite the 292<a href="#fn093" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> non-footnoted words, I don’t really know what to say here. I guess I do find it interesting which of my posts get more and less footnoted. I have been relying less on footnotes in recent posts, which is either a good sign that I am maturing as a writer and no longer feel the need for gimmicks, or a sign that I’ve been mentally exhausted constantly. I’m personally really hoping it’s the former not the latter.</p>
