<p>As it turns out, I may have allergies. I’m not allergic to what I thought I was, but that’s fun anyways. I’m also exhausted, because it turns out that histamine makes us tired. Anyways, that’s all I have to say today.</p>

<h1 id="poetry-planning"><a href="poetry-planning.html">Poetry Planning</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 December 26</p>
<p>Pre-reading note: Somewhat rambly</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>I talked about how I think that having schedules makes my life better. Well, at least better in the sense of more in line with the goals that I set. I mentioned <a href="new-year-plans-23.html">the other day</a> two things that will help, having preplanned ideas for blogging, and having a plan for the poems I’ll write.</p>
<p>Anyways, something something about N stones and M birds. There are 12 months in a year, which is one way I could arrange the poems I do. There are 52 weeks, which is another way I could do it.</p>
<p>Maybe it would be helpful to start with the kind of poems I have written before and enjoy writing.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sonnets</p></li>
<li><p>Villanelles</p></li>
<li><p>Ballads</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In general, I like doing poems which are at least somewhat metric and constrained. It’s weird to me to realize that I’ve only really written four types of poems in recent memory. It would be kind of nice to do more than that in the future.</p>
<p>So I think I’m going to do the same thing with poems that I’m doing with <a href="species-counterpoint-planning.html">counterpoint</a> and prose.<a href="#fn011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Sundays will be a day for writing something out of pocket and planning the rest of the week. Starting with the first week of the year, I’m going to shoot for the first six days to be sonnets.</p>

<h1 id="christmas-2022"><a href="christmas-2022.html">Christmas 2022</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 December 25</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>I don’t know why I was surprised that the only other Christmas post I made was in 2018, but I was. Anyways, since it’s Sunday, I’m going to reflect at least a little on the readings.</p>
<p>On one hand, it’s somewhat difficult to reflect on the Christmas readings. After all, despite the fact that there is just the one set,<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> there are four readings which belong to the celebration. The Vigil Mass has the same Gospel as last Sunday’s with verses on either side added.</p>
<p>I think there’s something beautiful in what part of the Nativity story each of the four readings focuses on. At the Vigil, which we celebrate because we take the custom of counting days starting at sunset from the Jewish tradition, we get the lineage of Christ. After the lineage, we are simply told that Mary was found with child, and that Joseph was a righteous man who did not want to put her to shame. We are reminded of the fact that Christ is the fulfillment of the promises to Abraham and his descendants.</p>
<p>At the Night Mass, we read from Luke. We are reminded that the Lord was born in the night amidst shepherds. In the darkest time of year, we are reminded of the Joy that came into the world, bringing light to our darkness.</p>
<p>As night turns to dawn, we get the readings for the Dawn Mass. The Gospel picks up exactly where the Night Mass ended. Just as we go from darkness and fear into praise and joy in the light, we watch the shepherds go and spread the glory of the Almighty.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the Day Mass. In this Gospel, we go through the beginning of John. We are not awaiting the Christchild anymore, we have received him. Now begins the season of preparations for Lent and Easter. And so, we first are reminded that Christ and the Father have been together since eternity. We then are told of John, who paves the way for Christ’s ministry.</p>
<p>Outside of the readings, I remain incredibly grateful for the time that I get to spend with my family. I am also incredibly grateful for the fact that I can communicate with my friends around the world. Merry Christmas to all.</p>

<p>As I<a href="#fn031" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> said, Saturdays are now for reflecting on a week of species counterpoint progress. This week has gone well! I managed to do it all six days.</p>
<p>After day three, I decided<a href="#fn032" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> that I wasn’t gaining much from the first species, so I decided to move on to second species. I think it might be fun to switch on day three of each week, though I’m not totally sure why.</p>
<p>Anyways, I’m enjoying it and getting better at it. I’m excited to see if it transfers to the quartet I’m writing tomorrow.</p>

<h1 id="new-year-plans-for-2023"><a href="new-year-plans-23.html">New Year Plans for 2023</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 December 23</p>
<p>Pre-reading note: This is rambly and I am sorry for that.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Every month I try to post a reflection on the past month and my goals for the upcoming month. But, all the thinking tends to happen day of, and I generally don’t find that I am too reflective for the rest of the month. Today has the fun thing where planning for next year<a href="#fn041" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and the day<a href="#fn042" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> are the same, which I’ll retroactively say is what inspired this post.</p>
<p>Looking through my monthly reflections, a few things stick out to me. More or less every month came with a<a href="#fn043" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> goal of blogging daily. I don’t know why I have it as a goal when I clearly don’t value it, as evidenced by my lack of daily blogs. Maybe I should be smart and start making a list of blog topics to go through on days where my mind is empty. That’s actually a really good idea, so time to make that list.<a href="#fn044" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>I tended to put keeping up with the BiaY podcast on there, which on a long-term level I’ve kind of done. I think I’ll be able to finish it by the end of the year. That goal can remain more or less unchanged.</p>
<p>Stretching/exercise of some sort was a recurring goal as well. I did not do a good job with it, and that’s something I don’t like. Unlike blogging, where the rewards for doing so are debatable if extant, there are clear benefits to me. I feel better, and I look better too. Plus it’s healthy, and I would like to be healthy. I think I tend to fail to stretch on mornings that I am running late, so having a better sleep routine would help me there.</p>
<p>A lot of my goals fall into the category of writing. In particular, I often had at least one of the three kinds of writing I do<a href="#fn045" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> as a goal. Each of them serves me in a different way. I’ve <a href="species-counterpoint-planning.html">already decided</a> that I would like to do more writing of song, and so I think I will keep that up. I keep telling myself that I’m going to actually put my prose out into the aether for someone to<a href="#fn046" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> read, and I think doing that would help me be better about actually writing more. Poetry is a strange one.</p>
<p>I really like writing poetry. I feel like it makes me more aware of how I’m doing mentally and emotionally. I like that it teaches me how to use words more intentionally. In less good motivations, I like that people seem surprised that I can write poetry. I think doing a poem a day would be achievable for me, especially since I have a writeblr<a href="#fn047" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> that I mostly post poetry on.<a href="#fn048" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> More than achievable, though, I think it would be healthy. Maybe plotting out what poems I would like to write would be a good idea.<a href="#fn049" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Practicing music is sort of the last category of recurring goals I had. I know on an intellectual level that I will improve my instruments faster and more reliably if I play them more. I feel like, again, having a plan would help me stick to it.<a href="#fn0410" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Moving one level deeper into my meta analysis, I’ve been reflecting on something that a creator I follow mused on. Their point was that resolutions should be framed less as specific and measurable goals, and more as aspirational concepts. That is, if your goal is really to get healthier, then “be healthier” as a theme is better than “run every day”, because of a lot of reasons. On many levels I agree. The general argument he makes is that life is a series of choices. If your choices tend to skew in one direction, that’s generally the life you end up living. By setting your goal as something big and encompassing, you have the slight nudge to the direction you want to face your life. The other point was that goals often change. Having the resolution to go to the gym every day gets dropped if you develop repetitive strain. If your goal was health, though, then you can put that energy into eating better or something.</p>
<p>The other thing that they point out is that years are bad amounts of time for goals. Instead, they suggest having themed seasons. I kind of like that, and so in addition to having a yearly and monthly reflection, I would like to also have quarterly reflections.<a href="#fn0411" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> I’m still not sure how I feel about having seasons related to general aspirations. But, the nice thing about something like this is that the worst that happens is I don’t like it and then I’m free from having to do it again. More than that, though, if it doesn’t work out, I know that it’s something I don’t need to try in the future. If it does work, though, then I have a new way of improving my life, which would be nice.</p>
<p>So, to summarize:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I would like to blog every day. I need to find a way to make that easier on myself. My current thought is having a backlog of ideas.</p></li>
<li><p>I would again like to do the BiaY, and this year I’d like to add CCCiaY. There’s not much to say there</p></li>
<li><p>I would like to be better about exercising, and need to figure out how to make that easier on myself. My current thought is having a better sleep schedule or fewer hard morning times.</p></li>
<li><p>I would like to write more and in the varied forms of prose, poetry, and song. I’ve already worked out how I’ll do the song, and that’s been really helpful for me<a href="#fn0412" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>. I think that the same would be true if I made goals for prose and poetry, so they go on the backlog. I also think that sharing my prose and poetry with the world would help me to write more, so I’ll try to do that.</p></li>
<li><p>I would like to practice music more. I think that having a plan would help with that.</p></li>
<li><p>I will try having monthly, quarterly, and yearly goals. The quarterly goals will be nebulous concepts such as “Reading,” or “Health”, which I will use to help shape the way I live my life.</p></li>

<p>I’ve decided that I do like a lot of the things I was working on in the book, so I want to rework it.

<h1 id="species-counterpoint-progress"><a href="species-counterpoint-2.html">Species Counterpoint Progress</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 December 21</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>I know that <a href="species-counterpoint-planning.html">I said</a> I would be doing one set a week, but I’ve done so much first species counterpoint with a single voice and cantus firmus that I already feel comfortable moving on. So, time to start second species.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the rules are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Consonant downbeats<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Offbeat disonances must be approached and left stepwise<a href="#fn062" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>No hidden (parallel) perfect intervals<a href="#fn063" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Two notes written per note in the cantus firmus</p></li>
<li><p>Generally prioritize small skips and step-wise movement</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s shocking to me how much harder this becomes. I immediately forgot that 4ths are dissonant, and I also had so many hidden parallel perfect intervals. However, I think this is also coming back to me quickly, so maybe I’ll be able to get through it in less than a week also.</p>

As part of preparation for that exam, I have been trying to write some code to see if it the project is even doable.</p>
<p>In doing so, I’m learning just how much I don’t really understand code. I’m lucky enough to be home and with my two brothers and fathers, all of whom are significantly better than me at coding.

<h1 id="species-counterpoint-planning"><a href="species-counterpoint-planning.html">Species Counterpoint Planning</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 December 19</p>
<p>Prereading note: This will be rambly</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As I <a href="musescore-4.html">mentioned recently</a>, I’m really enjoying playing around in Musescore. But, I don’t like being bad at composing, especially when I’m doing it. One thing I’ve tried to do before is species counterpoint.</p>
<p>Species counterpoint is a set of compositional exercises that’s pretty (in)famously used in a lot of composition curricula, especially historically. Generally you begin with a whole note melody that you write a harmony to. The harmony has to follow some general rules<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> such as limited leaps<a href="#fn082" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, forbiddance of parallel perfect intervals, and so on. Additionally, within each species there are specific rules. There are five species<a href="#fn083" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>First Species: Whole note against whole note. In this form, you generally are only allowed “consonant”<a href="#fn084" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> intervals.<a href="#fn085" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Second Species: Half note against whole note.<a href="#fn086" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Here the second note may be dissonant, but only as a step-wise passing tone.</p></li>
<li><p>Third Species: Quarter note against whole note.<a href="#fn087" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>. As before, only the first note needs to be consonant, and dissonances need to be approached and left stepwise.</p></li>
<li><p>Fourth Species: Suspended whole notes offset by a half note. Generally if the suspension becomes dissonant, it needs to resolve down by a step. If not, you can leap or move up.</p></li>
<li><p>Fifth Species: Melody against whole note.<a href="#fn088" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> I think then the rules are fairly loose, though generally still consonant on first note unless suspended over.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The pedagogical resources I’ve seen generally recommend working with your <em>cantus firmus</em><a href="#fn089" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> both above and below the written melody for practice.</p>
<p>After mastering<a href="#fn0810" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> the five species, you can then add another voice and start over. As it turns out, that causes 55 lessons if I want to get up to three voices in fifth species against a single cantus firmus.</p>
<p>From <a href="book-review-atomic-habits.html">a book on habits I read</a>, it’s best if new habits can be accomplished in under three minutes. Historically, writing a single first-species line takes less than three minutes, so I’d like to try doing six days of counterpoint a week, moving lessons each week. At first, both because I want to slowly build the habit, and because I know first species with a single voice well, I will just do a single exercise. I’d like to spend the seventh day<a href="#fn0811" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> setting a song to four-part string arrangement, both because I like how it sounds in Musescore ,and because I want to get more practice actually writing music.</p>
<p>The plan is:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>One Voice First Species</p></li>
<li><p>One Voice Second Species</p></li>
<li><p>...</p></li>
<li><p>One Voice Fifth Species</p></li>
<li><p>Two Voices, First and First Species</p></li>
<li><p>Two Voices First and Second Species</p></li>
<li><p>...</p></li>
<li><p>Two Voices First and Fifth Species</p></li>
<li><p>Two Voices Second and Second Species</p></li>
<li><p>...</p></li>
<li><p>Two Voices Fifth and Fifth Species</p></li>
<li><p>Three Voices First, First, and First Species</p></li>
<li><p>...</p></li>
<li><p>Three Voices Fifth, Fifth, and Fifth Species</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If I start today, I’ll be finished near the beginning of 2024. It’s good to set big stretch goals I hear.</p>

<h1 id="reflections-on-todays-gospel"><a href="reflections-on-readings-2-advent-a-22.html">Reflections on Today’s Gospel</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 December 18</p>
<p>Matthew 1:24 “When Joseph awoke, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took his wife into his home.”</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>The Gospel today focuses on the earthly father of our savior, St. Joseph. Lately I’ve been reading and hearing a lot of modern opinions on him, and many of them make me uncomfortable.</p>
<p>In part, this is because we know so little about him. As is often joked, if St. Joseph is the ideal husband, then the ideal husband never speaks. This references the fact that Joseph has no dialogue attributed to him in the Bible or Tradition.</p>
<p>More than that, though, we know nearly nothing about the man who raised the Lord through his childhood. We know he was a carpenter, and not a particularly well-off one<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. We know that he did not have sexual relations with Mary. We know that he died before Christ was crucified. We know that he radically and totally trusted in the Lord to guide him. And yet, people will put much more on him.</p>
<p>In part, I think this is because we want to be able to connect with the holy men and women who came before us. That’s a great and noble goal.</p>
<p>In part, I see a lot of it as coming as a response to what’s seen as the emasculation of modern society. That’s not great, in my eyes at least.</p>
<p>And, in part I think that we don’t like to have unanswered questions. That’s natural.</p>
<p>I don’t know where I’m going with this reflection, other than to say that to model St. Joseph really means that when we hear a call from the Lord, we uproot our lives and do as He commands.</p>
