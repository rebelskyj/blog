<p>Prereading note: I find myself beginning to put my words to the page<a href="#fn001" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> as the time quickly approaches midnight. As a result, I apologize for any roughness in this posting.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Tonight, I had the wonderful fortune of seeing <em>The Importance of Being Earnest</em> at the Vaudeville Theatre. Overall, the show was enjoyable, though different from what I had expected.</p>
<p>What was<a href="#fn002" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> a show of subtlety and wit became, instead, a loud and forceful and exuberant farce.</p>
<p>From the beginning, I should have known it would be so, as the curtain onstage had a quote from Oscar Wilde:<a href="#fn003" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref3"><sup>3</sup></a> “If one tells the truth, one is sure sooner or later, to be found out.” As the show begins, a piano and accompanying orchestra play loudly and beautifully, as the stage slowly lights, and the once opaque curtain becomes transparent. The curtain opens, and we get a chance to see Algernon playing the piano. From his first actions, it is clear that this will be a show, not of subtly implied innuendo, but rather over the top theatrics and staging.</p>
<p>The blocking was continuously adding a second thread to the show. At the beginning, when Jack and Gwendolen are flirting during the conversation, their blocking is theatrical and beautiful. In scene three, the three servants add another layer to the show, reminding us both of the existence of the stage behind us, as well as the motion of life.</p>
<p>The lighting was continuously sublime. As peaks and valleys in action happened, so too did the lights subtly do so. In the second scene, as the day progresses, the stage left light slowly rose from perspective, and the fog on the stage cleared as well. It was a beautiful way to suggest the passage of time. In the third scene, where we see the world from the other side, just a short time later, the sun is facing from stage right. The little details like that made this production eminently enjoyable</p>

<h1 id="draft-3">Draft 3</h1>
<p>In my first year of college I gained<a href="#fn011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> the moniker of “bread guy.”<a href="#fn012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Now, this was not an unforeseeable outcome. I baked<a href="#fn013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> bread almost every day, and tended to have the same problem: by the time I finish making bread,<a href="#fn014" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> I don’t really want it anymore, since I would’ve been smelling it for the time it took to cook.<a href="#fn015" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#fn016" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>This problem should have an easy resolution. I would just give it to my friends!<a href="#fn017" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Of course, sometimes my so called “friends” wouldn’t want to eat the bread I made.<a href="#fn018" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>I know, It’s ridiculous to me too. Who wouldn’t want bread?</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I would need to get rid of the bread another way. My next step would be to find the people who occupy the hard to define mental space of people you know, but have no emotions attached to.<a href="#fn019" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Once I found them,<a href="#fn0110" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> I would also offer bread. That also didn’t have a 100% success rate, which hurt less.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I would just walk around campus and hand it out<a href="#fn0111" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> to whoever I saw, and sometimes I would just leave it in public spaces near people who volunteered to dispose of it for me. Nonetheless, I made a lot of bread and got known for it.</p>
<p>Now, the moniker served another purpose.<a href="#fn0112" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> The CS<a href="#fn0113" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> department<a href="#fn0114" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> at Grinnell College<a href="#fn0115" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>was<a href="#fn0116" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> growing rapidly, so there were many students who might assume I was related to a member of the department.<a href="#fn0117" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> I assumed<a href="#fn0118" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> that being known as “slightly odd person who feeds us” was better than being known as “child of very odd, grumpy, and sarcastic person,” if only because I was being described as my own entity in the first.</p>
<p>But anyways, back to what’s important: bread. My recipe is adapted from <a href="https://artisanbreadinfive.com">this website’s book</a>. I tend to make the dough in a 3 gallon ice cream container from Kilwins, as my family somehow acquired many of them. It exists below.</p>
<p>Basic Bread Dough:</p>
<p>Ingredients:<br />
5 pounds flour<a href="#fn0119" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a><br />
8-9 cups water<a href="#fn0120" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a><br />
2 heaping tablespoons yeast<a href="#fn0121" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a><br />
2 lightly heaping tablespoons kosher salt<a href="#fn0122" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a><br />
Note: if making a second batch, if you leave the dough that is leftover in the container, you can skip the yeast.<a href="#fn0123" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>To Make Dough:<br />
Add all ingredients together.<a href="#fn0124" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a><br />
Mix until it seems to be one coherent blob of dough.<a href="#fn0125" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a><br />
Cover, but not airtightly, and let sit at room temperature until doubled in size.<a href="#fn0126" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a><br />
Then, cover airtight<a href="#fn0127" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> for up to two weeks<a href="#fn0128" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> The longer you let it sit, the more sour it will be.<a href="#fn0129" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>To Cook:<br />
Sprinkle flour on top of dough.<a href="#fn0130" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a><br />
Pull out a piece of dough the volume of bread you want.<a href="#fn0131" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a><br />
Generously coating with flour, gently fold it over itself until smooth everywhere except one spot.<a href="#fn0132" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a><br />
After placing the bread with the spot down,<a href="#fn0133" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> quickly score the surface of the dough with a razor blade, aiming for around half an inch deep.<a href="#fn0134" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a><br />
Put onto a stone in an oven preheated for around 30 minutes at 350 F<a href="#fn0135" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> with a stone and a baking tray<a href="#fn0136" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> inside, the tray beneath the stone.<br />
Pour water onto the baking tray.<a href="#fn0137" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a><br />
Let cook until bottom is hollow when tapped, or properly golden brown.<a href="#fn0138" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a><br />
If in doubt, a few extra minutes never hurts, and often helps.<a href="#fn0139" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a><br />
Pull out and let cool.<a href="#fn0140" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a><br />

<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>In my first year of college I gained the moniker of “bread guy,”<a href="#fn0141" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> Now, this was not an unforeseeable outcome.

<p>So, bread. My recipe is adapted from <a href="https://artisanbreadinfive.com">this website’s book</a>. I tend to make the dough in a 3 gallon ice cream container from Kilwins, as my family somehow acquired many of them. It exists below.</p>

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>My freshman year of college, I was nicknamed “the bread guy,”<a href="#fn0160" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref60" role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a> Now, this was not an unforeseeable outcome. I baked bread almost every day, and ran into my usual problem with baking bread. By the time the bread would be finished cooking, I wouldn’t really want to eat it anymore, since I would’ve been smelling it for the time it took to cook.<a href="#fn0161" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref61" role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>So, I would need to get rid of it somehow. Thankfully, instead of just setting it on fire,<a href="#fn0162" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref62" role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a> or otherwise wasting it, I would give it to friends. Of course, sometimes my so called “friends” wouldn’t want to eat the bread I made.</p>
<p>I know! It’s ridiculous to me too. So, I would need to get rid of the bread another way. Generally this meant finding the random people you know that you wouldn’t consider friends<a href="#fn0163" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref63" role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a> and offering them some fresh baked bread. Sometimes, I would just walk around campus and hand it out<a href="#fn0164" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref64" role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a> to whoever I saw, and sometimes I would just leave it in public spaces near people who volunteered to dispose of it for me. Nonetheless, I made a lot of bread and got known for it.</p>
<p>There was a motive behind getting this nickname. I knew that, since the CS<a href="#fn0165" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref65" role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a> department<a href="#fn0166" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref66" role="doc-noteref"><sup>66</sup></a> was<a href="#fn0167" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref67" role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a> growing rapidly, there were many students who might assume I was related to a member of the department. And, I figured being known as “slightly odd person who feeds us edible home made food” was better than being known as “child of very odd, grumpy, and sarcastic person,” if only because I was being described as my own entity in the first.</p>
<p>So, without further ado: my basic bread recipe. It is adapted from <a href="https://artisanbreadinfive.com">this website’s book</a>. I tend to make the dough in a 3 gallon ice cream container from Kilwins, as my family somehow acquired many of them.</p>
<p>Basic Bread Dough: Ingredients:<br />

2 heaping tablespoons yeast<br />
2 lightly heaping tablespoons kosher salt</p>
<p>To Make Dough:<br />
Add all ingredients together.<br />
Mix until it seems to be one coherent blob of dough.<br />
Cover, but not totally, and let sit at room temperature for a time lasting between: just barely doubled<a href="#fn0168" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref68" role="doc-noteref"><sup>68</sup></a> or up to 2 weeks.<a href="#fn0169" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref69" role="doc-noteref"><sup>69</sup></a><br />
The longer you let it sit, the more sour it will be.</p>

Putting that spot down,<a href="#fn0170" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref70" role="doc-noteref"><sup>70</sup></a> quickly score the surface of the dough with a razor blade, aiming for around half an inch deep.<br />
Put onto a stone in an oven that has been heating for around 30 minutes at 350 F<a href="#fn0171" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref71" role="doc-noteref"><sup>71</sup></a> with a stone inside, and a baking tray<a href="#fn0172" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref72" role="doc-noteref"><sup>72</sup></a> beneath it.<br />

<h1 id="toffee-recipe"><a href="toffee-recipe.html">Toffee Recipe</a></h1>
<h1 id="draft-3">Draft 3</h1>
<p>There are some recipes I make mostly as an excuse to make others. Among those is toffee. Nowadays, I mostly<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> make toffee when I’m making chocolate toffee cookies.<a href="#fn022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> This is not a recipe for the cookies,<a href="#fn023" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> but only for the toffee.</p>
<p>Now, you may notice the preface of “nowadays” for how I make toffee lately. At first, I made toffee for its own sake. The first time I made it, I made it for one of my older brother’s friends. What follows is the fruit of my painstaking<a href="#fn024" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> trials into making toffee.</p>
<p>Ingredients:<br />
1/2 cup salted butter<br />
1/2 white granulated sugar<br />
1 dash vanilla</p>
<p>Directions:<br />
Put butter in large sauce pan (at least 6x the volume of the butter) over low heat.<br />
When butter is mostly melted, add sugar and vanilla, and mix until well incorporated.<br />
While cooking, it should expand to a much larger size. When it does so, continue stirring until it reaches hard crack,<a href="#fn025" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> or, once you’ve made it a few times, until the aroma and color is correct.<br />
Pour into a well greased sheet pan<br />
Let cool until solid.<br />
Break into pieces.<br />
Serve however you intend to.</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>When I was younger, one of the first recipes I taught myself<a href="#fn026" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> was toffee. Now, this was not an unprompted decision. A friend of my brother remarked on the expense of it, and after looking at the price, I thought it unreasonable, given how simple the recipe is. And, after much experimentation with other recipes, I’ve found one that works for me. Here it is:</p>
<p>1/2 cup salted butter<br />
1/2 white granulated sugar<br />
1 dash vanilla</p>
<p>Put butter in pan over low heat.<br />
When butter is mostly melted, add sugar and vanilla.<br />
Cook, stirring occasionally until it begins to grow in size.<br />
Continue cooking until when you drop a little into a glass of room temperature water, it cools to a hard, crunchy ball,<a href="#fn027" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> then pour onto a greased sheet pan.<br />
Let cool until solid.<br />
Break into pieces.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>When I was a young lad,<a href="#fn028" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> I learned how to make toffee. Now, this was not an unprompted decision. One of my brother’s friends really liked toffee, and I learned this when I received an email from a candy company.<a href="#fn029" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> He asked me how much it would cost to purchase some, and I thought the price looked ridiculous. When I looked up the recipe, it seemed simple enough to make. And, it is!<a href="#fn0210" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> So, a recipe for Toffee:</p>
<p>1/2 cup salted butter<br />
1/2 white granulated sugar<br />
1 dash vanilla</p>
<p>Put butter in pan over low heat.<br />
When butter is mostly melted, add sugar and vanilla.<br />
Cook, stirring occasionally until it begins to grow in size.<br />
Continue cooking until the correct color, then pour onto a greased sheet pan.<br />
Let cool until solid.<br />
Break into pieces.</p>

<h1 id="making-a-mixtape"><a href="making-a-mixtape.html">Making a Mixtape</a></h1>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>I couldn’t think of anything to write today. But, I was listening to a lot of music today, so I thought I’d try to make a mixtape. The theme is inspiration, specifically academic inspiration.</p>
<p>Front Side:<br />
Anthem by Harry Chapin<br />
Anything I’m Not by Lenka<br />
Corner of the Sky from the Pippin (New Broadway Cast Recording)<br />
Country Dreams by Harry Chapin<br />
Cover of the Rolling Stone by Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show<br />
Dammit Janet by the Rocky Horror Cast<br />
Dancing Queen by ABBA<br />
Don’t Stop Believing by Journey</p>
<p>Back Side:<br />
Grey Seal by Elton John<br />
A Hard Day’s Night by the Beatles<br />
Heartbeat (It’s a Love Beat) by the DeFranco Family<br />
How Far I’ll Go from Moana<br />
It’s Still Rock And Roll To Me by Billy Joel<br />
Kelly the Boy from Killane by the High Kings<br />
Livin’ On A Prayer by Bon Jovi<br />
Long Goodbye by the Nadas<br />
Mo Ghile Mear by Celtic Thunder</p>
<p>Explanation: Like Chapin’s protagonist, who’s “looking for an anthem”, I start by searching for motivation to start a paper. But, within seconds of writing a paper, I realize that it’s hard to be “Anything I’m Not”, and I’m hoinh to procrastinate. I’ll go find my “Corner of the Sky” to hang out at until I have the motivation to work. While in the “Country(,) Dreams” of avoiding responsibility come into my head. But, if I want to make it “On the Cover of the Rolling Stone”, I’ll need to get to work, and “Dammit Janet”<a href="#fn031" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> I can’t think of anything. I just want to be “Dancing (to) Queen”, not writing this paper. But I know that if I “Don’t stop Believing” and write this paper, I might have time to go out.</p>
<p>I can’t really work “Grey Seal” in here, but it’s a good next song. As I look at the clock, unsure of whether the 6 is an AM or PM, I realize it’s been “A Hard Day’s Night”. And, as the deadline approaches, our heart may start pumping out of control. But, if we remember that “Heartbeat (It’s a Love Beat)” you can tell yourself that it’s not panic, it’s love of the topic.</p>
<p>As the paper continues, I often wonder “How Far I’ll Go” in trying to finish the paper. What’s the tenuous connection I hope the professor won’t latch on to.</p>
<p>Each paper and assignment is still somehow different from the one before. But, as Billy Joel points out, “It’s Still Rock And Roll To Me”. Every work is different, but the same in principle.</p>
<p>“Kelly the Boy from Killane” is just a bop.</p>
<p>As I’ve mentioned a lot so far, as a deadline draws near, students often feel nervous, like they’re “Living On A Prayer”. And, as we look at the work we have left in the semester, and the time left to do it, we may have to say a “Long Goodbye” to our friends until the work we all have is resolved.</p>
<p>But, we have hope that we’ll make it through. “Mo Ghile Mear” is a song of hope, so it seems fitting to end the list.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As I’ve mentioned in many other posts, I like music. So, I decided that I would make a mix tape today. Cassette tapes apparently hold 60-90 minutes of music, so that seems like a good length to shoot for. I’ll assume 30 minutes per side, since I’m feeling unambitious.</p>
<p>Next I need a theme. I think today’s theme will be inspiration. It’s the point in the semester where it seems that inspiration is needed.<a href="#fn032" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Of course, inspiration comes in a variety of places. So, I’ll start with “Anthem” by Harry Chapin.<a href="#fn033" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref3"><sup>3</sup></a> I’ll follow it with Lenka’s “Anything I’m Not”.<a href="#fn034" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref4"><sup>4</sup></a> <a href="#fn035" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Next is “Corner of the Sky” from the Pippin (New Broadway Cast Recording) <a href="#fn036" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Following that will be “Country Dreams” by Harry Chapin.<a href="#fn037" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref7"><sup>7</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#fn038" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Next: “Cover of the Rolling Stone” by Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show.<a href="#fn039" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref9"><sup>9</sup></a> After this: “Dammit Janet” by the Rocky Horror Cast.<a href="#fn0310" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Of course, I would be remiss if I didn’t throw some ABBA in, so next is Dancing Queen.<a href="#fn0311" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref11"><sup>11</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#fn0312" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Continuing the theme of powerpop from older generations’ childhoods, “Don’t Stop Believing” by Journey.<a href="#fn0313" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Backside: “Grey Seal” by Elton John.<a href="#fn0314" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref14"><sup>14</sup></a> It was so tempting to put another Harry Chapin song here,<a href="#fn0315" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref15"><sup>15</sup></a> but instead, “A Hard Day’s Night” by the Beatles.<a href="#fn0316" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref16"><sup>16</sup></a> And: “Heartbeat (It’s a Love Beat)” by the DeFranco Family.<a href="#fn0317" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Following that, “How Far I’ll Go” from Moana.<a href="#fn0318" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Next: since I realize I’m missing Billy Joel, “It’s Still Rock And Roll To Me”.<a href="#fn0319" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref19"><sup>19</sup></a> “Kelly The Boy from Killane” as performed by the High Kings follows this.<a href="#fn0320" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Returning to nostalgia I have no right to have, “Livin’ On A Prayer” by Bon Jovi.<a href="#fn0321" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref21"><sup>21</sup></a> And, following that, a song by an Iowa group<sup>,</sup>footnote<span>yay!</span> “Long Goodbye” by the Nadas.<a href="#fn0322" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Finishing off the playlist, “Mo Ghile Mear” as performed by Celtic Thunder.<a href="#fn0323" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Time to give the playlist a<a href="#fn0324" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref24"><sup>24</sup></a> listen, then revise/add comments. To begin: I started with Harry Chapin’s “Anthem,” because it has a strong driving beat, which helps focus, and it has lyrics that I appreciate. Also, the background instrumentation feels much sparser than most of his songs, which I appreciate.</p>
<p>Anything I’m Not follows, as it too has a strong pulse. Unlike Chapin, Lenka has<a href="#fn0325" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref25"><sup>25</sup></a> a much more cheerful outlook. The song ends with an idea of escaping, and becoming free, which fits in so well with the next song.</p>
<p>Corner of the Sky is my favorite Pippin song, and one of my favorite musical theatre songs. Like many graduates of my high school, I have fond memories of watching our choir director sing this song at our senior choir concert. The song helps keep me focused when I really need to get work done.<a href="#fn0326" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref26"><sup>26</sup></a> It speaks about finding where you belong, which the next Chapin song, “Country Dreams” does as well.</p>
<p>Unlike in the Pippin song, Chapin fully accepts that he’s given up on his dreams. But, he’s accepted that, and still keeps on trucking. Especially as deadlines approach, knowing that you’ve got something, even if it’s not what you want, is all you can sometimes ask for.</p>
<p>But, we still dream big, and so to do Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show’s in “Cover of the Rolling Stone”. Of course, once you’re at the top, there’s always something that can go wrong. A car could break down outside of a house, and you might need to go into a creepy house to get your way back to civilization.</p>
<p>Of course, that’s nonsense, but “Dammit Janet” from Rocky Horror Picture Show has the strong beat that we appreciated in the first songs, and speaks of Brad’s<a href="#fn0327" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref27"><sup>27</sup></a> goal to achieve.</p>
<p>Next, “Dancing Queen” by ABBA starts with the line that students dream of during studies.<a href="#fn0328" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref28"><sup>28</sup></a> After 20 minutes of concentration, I need something to lighten my spirits.</p>
<p>Of course, the next song, “Don’t Stop Believing” speaks to me every time I know I don’t have enough time to finish an assignment. Somehow, I’ll make it through. And there ends the front side.</p>
<p>In the time it takes me to switch our metaphorical cassette tape over,<a href="#fn0329" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref29"><sup>29</sup></a> I need a quick and lively introduction. Elton John’s “Grey Seal” gives that to me. Then, since homework is still continuing, “A Hard Day’s Night” goes through my head when I’ve been inside a building working on an assignment, and am not sure which 6 the clock is pointing to.<a href="#fn0330" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref30"><sup>30</sup></a> And, as the deadline approaches, our heart may start pumping out of control. But, if we remember that “Heartbeat (It’s a Love Beat)” you can tell yourself that it’s not panic, it’s love of the topic.</p>
<p>As the paper continues, I often wonder “How Far I’ll Go” in trying to finish the paper. What’s the tenuous connection I hope the professor won’t latch on to.</p>
<p>Each paper and assignment is still somehow different from the one before. But, as Billy Joel points out, “It’s Still Rock And Roll To Me”. Every work is different, but the same in principle.</p>
<p>There’s nothing special about “Kelly the Boy from Killane”, it’s just a motivational song.</p>
<p>As I’ve mentioned a lot so far, as a deadline draws near, students often feel nervous, like they’re “Living On A Prayer”. And, as we look at the work we have left in the semester, and the time left to do it, we may have to say a “Long Goodbye” to our friends until the work we all have is resolved. And, like any good playlist, it ends with hope. Specifically, hope that someone will come set us free. Here, “Mo Ghile Mear” stands in nicely.</p>

<p>So, there’s a reason for me to be at the Baptist Church, and it isn’t that I’ve had a sudden change of faith. Instead, there’s an Irish Bagpiping group that meets there every Thursday night. They’re an Irish Bagpiping group in the sense that they play the Irish Bagpipes,<a href="#fn053" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref3"><sup>3</sup></a> not the “normal” Scottish Pipes.<a href="#fn054" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Uilleann Pipes are objectively better as an instrument in many regards.

<p>The first week I was here, they didn’t meet, as it was Summer vacation in London. The second was the same. Last week, I was locked out of my dorm, so needed to find a way back into it.<a href="#fn055" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref5"><sup>5</sup></a> And this week, some members of the group decided to do a movie night, so I attended that instead.<a href="#fn056" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Maybe next week?</p>

<p>Prereading note: while writing a different post,<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I ended up needing to deeply nest some statements. I realized<a href="#fn062" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> that I had spent around equal time setting up the prereading note to actually writing the post, so I decided to just turn the note into its own post.

Also, since I needed to make sure my<a href="#fn063" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> footnotes parsed, I relabeled Draft 2 as 2/3, since it’s unclear which is the correct term.<a href="#fn064" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Draft 4 remains as such.</p>

<h1 id="digital-diaries"><a href="digital-diaries.html">Digital Diaries</a></h1>
<p>Prereading note: this post was written as an assignment, so drafts 4-6<a href="#fn071" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> lack much of my snark and<a href="#fn072" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> will read much more like an academic essay. In the final draft, I hope to have restored some of the charm<a href="#fn073" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> that I tend to have in my writings.</p>
<h1 id="draft-7">Draft 7</h1>
<p>Diaries today are becoming more and more of a digital phenomenon. That is, people are deciding to record their thoughts on computers, rather than paper. This transition from analog to digital is not wholly uncontroversial.</p>
<p>Many people have a distrust of digital diary keeping. However, their objections almost always orient around the alleged fragility of digital diaries.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with the Internet, online storage can seem horribly fragile. Unlike a bound book, which can last indefinitely,<a href="#fn074" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> digital diaries require constant upkeep. If written in a word processor, a blog<a href="#fn075" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> post could become unreadable if the file format becomes obsolete or unused.<a href="#fn076" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> But, most blogs are, as the name suggests, hosted on the Internet.</p>
<p>A second concern is that posts on the web may be pulled down or somehow become unavailable.<a href="#fn077" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> The fact that two different agencies,<a href="#fn078" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> both make constant backups of the Internet is seen as a lackluster response.<a href="#fn079" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> And, unlike physical diaries, anyone can access any blog from anywhere and anytime, which frees the researcher from needing the funds to go to the specific library where a diary is held, or find a way to have a copy made. The copies are automatically made to every computer accessing the site.</p>
<p>Since these backups exist so widely, it is far less likely that we will undergo a similar loss to the burning of the Library of Alexandria or the burning of the linguistic library in Brazil.<a href="#fn0710" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Had the files in the library been digital, they would have been hosted in a different site from the physical artifacts, preventing that horrible loss of knowledge.</p>
<p>That tragedy calls out the most important problem with preferring physical media over digital media. Yes, you can duplicate a physical document. If you don’t care about the exactness of the replicated document,<a href="#fn0711" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> it is a fairly trivial process<a href="#fn0712" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> to transcribe a backup.<a href="#fn0713" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> But, as the recent burning of the Brazilian library shows, even vitally important documents aren’t always backed up.<a href="#fn0714" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> The Internet, however, backs up everything.</p>
<p>And to me, the heart of digital diary and the Internet is reflected by this fact: neither promises permanence, only equality. Every work hosted on Wordpress, for instance, is equally likely to be there in fifty year’s time.<a href="#fn0715" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> The famous and forgotten will both exist in perpetuity. Therefore, to me, the arguments against online diaries, especially now, some 20 years after the first published arguments, are nothing except baseless fear of the future.</p>
<h1 id="draft-6">Draft 6</h1>
<p>Diaries are becoming a digital phenomenon. That is, people are deciding to record their thoughts on computers, rather than paper. This transition from analog to digital is not wholly uncontroversial.</p>
<p>Many people have a distrust of digital diary keeping. However, their objections almost always orient around the alleged fragility of digital diaries.<a href="#fn0716" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with the Internet, online storage can seem horribly fragile. Unlike a bound book, which can last indefinitely, digital diaries require constant upkeep. If written in a word processor, a blog<a href="#fn0717" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> post could become unreadable if the file format becomes obsolete or unused. But, most blogs are, as the name suggests, hosted on the Internet.</p>
<p>A second concern is that posts on the web may be pulled down or somehow become unavailable. The fact that two different agencies,<a href="#fn0718" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> both make constant backups of the Internet is seen as a lackluster response. O’Sullivan complains that “the Wayback Machine does not have word or subject search capabilities,”<a href="#fn0719" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>, which would hold merit if not for the fact that physical diaries and libraries also lack subject search without the work of dedicated stewards.

<p>Diaries, like many written records, are becoming more and more of a digital phenomenon. That is, more and more people decide to record their thoughts on digital displays, rather than analog records. And, like the other forms becoming digital, the transition from analog to digital is not wholly uncontroversial.</p>
<p>For many reasons, people have a distrust of digital diary keeping. But, even a mild examination of most of these objections shows that they are deeply rooted in either classist thoughts or appeals to tradition. They almost always find themselves orienting around the alleged fragility of digital diaries, regardless of the factuality of these claims.<a href="#fn0726" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with the Internet, online storage can seem horribly fragile. Unlike a bound book, which can last indefinitely, digital diaries require constant upkeep. If written in a word processor, for instance, a blog<a href="#fn0727" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> post could plausibly become unreadable if the file format becomes obsolete or unused. However, since nearly old computers are still functional, and old operating systems are constantly being ported to new machines, it is unlikely that we will ever have files that we truly cannot open. They may be difficult to interpret, but no more so than damaged manuscripts.</p>
<p>A second concern is that posts on the web may be pulled down or somehow also become unavailable. The obvious rebuttal to this statement, namely the Internet Archive<a href="#fn0728" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> or Google’s own caching system is seen as lackluster.

<p>However, the lack of searching capabilities is never seen as a flaw in traditional diaries. Unlike physical diaries, anyone can access any blog from anywhere and anytime, which frees the researcher from needing the funds to go to the specific library where a diary is held, or find a way to have a copy made. They can also search, since every modern web browser has search and find capabilities.</p>

<p>The most honest answer is that they don’t. Most likely nothing any given blogger has to say won’t be relevant. Nonetheless, the Internet protects and safeguards it.

<h1 id="othello-review"><a href="othello.html">Othello Review</a></h1>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Tonight I had the pleasure of watching Othello at the Globe Theatre. In a wonderful turn of events, I was a groundling.<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> I was right next to the stage, and even leaning on it for the piece of the play after intermission.</p>
<p>Sadly, the set and lighting didn’t blow me away. The lights were fixed and immobile, and the set more or less was as well. What I can comment on, however, was the music.</p>
<p>The show began with natural trumpets,<a href="#fn082" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> which was nice. Come the scene where Cassio becomes drunk, they are replaced with valved trumpets. Before the first intermission, they bring out the cornetti,</p>
<p>In the second act, the cornetti play lamentations as the piece falls to its tragic fate. The ending dance, however, returns with the beautiful jazz trumpeting. Other instruments included a lute during the drunk scene, played masterfully by Iago, drums and other percussion played by instrumentalists, and whistles.</p>
<p>Finally, as is requested by Shakespeare, there is singing. The drunken songs sounded drunk and merry. The whole cast song at the end was sung brilliantly.<a href="#fn083" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref3"><sup>3</sup></a> But, the song that struck me hardest was Desdemona and Emilia’s duet of the Willow Tree. They flowed between two part harmony and unisons flawlessly and beautifully. I stood entranced for the first<a href="#fn084" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref4"><sup>4</sup></a> time in the show. Nothing existed for me except the two flowing voices and the story they told.</p>
<p>And truly, that’s all that I can ask of a show. There was a moment where time stood still, and I found myself drawn, not into the story or characters, but simply into a place where I feel what the characters feel. Even in professional theatre, those moments can be hard to come by, but the cast brought me nearly to that point time and time again, and to the point in the soulful duet. But, as all good things do,<a href="#fn085" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref5"><sup>5</sup></a> it too came to an end.</p>

<h1 id="todays-gospel"><a href="todays-gospel.html">Today’s Gospel</a></h1>
<h1 id="draft-3">Draft 3</h1>
<p>Today’s Gospel<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> reading features one of the two lines that I find most striking in the Gospels.<a href="#fn092" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Jesus exhorts Peter, “Get behind me, Satan!”<a href="#fn093" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Peter, the man who<a href="#fn094" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Jesus loved and trusted so much so that he entrusted the Church to him, is called Satan.<a href="#fn095" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref5"><sup>5</sup></a> To me, this truly shows two of the important pieces of my Catholic faith: we are to act and speak as we see true, not always meekly or gently, and that we are to love the sinner and hate the sin. Jesus doesn’t reproach Peter in soft words, or calmly. In fact, he doesn’t even do it kindly. In no uncertain words, he tells Peter that he is sinning.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, 6 days later, he takes Peter to the mountain where he meets with Elijah and Moses.<a href="#fn096" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Even though the Gospels don’t mention it, clearly Jesus forgave Peter for his actions, and Peter tried to accept this change.</p>
<p>This reading particularly speaks to me in today’s climate. We tend to take neither of the two messages we are told to take. We don’t tell the people we love to their faces that what they are doing is wrong.<a href="#fn097" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref7"><sup>7</sup></a> We also don’t do the other side of the message, and forgive those who do wrong. I’m as guilty of this as anyone. I judge quickly and quietly, then discount anything that someone who has spoken out of ignorance has to say. Today’s reading was a good reminder to me that I need to try harder to love, even when it’s hard.</p>

<p>Today’s Gospel<a href="#fn098" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref8"><sup>8</sup></a> reading features one of the two lines that I find most striking in the Gospels.<a href="#fn099" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Jesus exhorts Peter, “Get behind me, Satan!”<a href="#fn0910" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Peter, the man who<a href="#fn0911" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Jesus loved and trusted so much so that he entrusted the Church to him, is called Satan, the great betrayer. To me, this truly shows two of the important pieces of my Catholic faith: we are to act and speak as we see true, not as we see convenient, and that we are to love the sinner and hate the sin. Jesus doesn’t reproach Peter in soft words, or calmly. Nonetheless, 6 days later, he takes Peter to the mountain where he meets with Elijah and Moses.<a href="#fn0912" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Even though the Gospels don’t mention it, clearly Jesus forgave Peter for his actions.</p>
<p>Overall, this reading speaks to me, especially in today’s climate. We tend to take neither of the two messages we are told to take.

Moreso, it points out to me that we have the responsibility to help those around us who make mistakes. 6 days later, he takes Peter to the mountain where he meets with Elijah and Moses.<a href="#fn0916" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Even though the Gospels don’t mention it, clearly there was some conversation during those 6 days where the misunderstanding was resolved.</p>
