<p>First Published: 2024 January 2</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>a] At the beginning of the ’blog, I mentioned that one of my great inspirations for writing this was my father.<span id="link[1"><a href="#target[1"><sup>1</sup></a></span></p>
<p>One of the<span id="link[2"><a href="#target[2"><sup>2</sup></a></span> most striking pieces of his blog is the use of footnotes. That is, in addition to using footnotes,<span id="link[5"><a href="#target[5"><sup>5</sup></a></span> he also uses end notes which are called from other end notes.<span id="link[6"><a href="#target[6"><sup>6</sup></a></span> Now, like many people exploring a medium, he has done any number of interesting things with these end notes.<span id="link[8"><a href="#target[8"><sup>8</sup></a></span></p>
<p>As someone trying to emulate a lot of his blog,<span id="link[10"><a href="#target[10"><sup>10</sup></a></span> I also wanted nested footnotes. It turns out that, while I am not unique in this request, I am close to it. There appears to be a single reason that style guides believe that footnotes or end notes<span id="link[11"><a href="#target[11"><sup>11</sup></a></span> can be reasonably nested. As we know<span id="link[12"><a href="#target[12"><sup>12</sup></a></span> , there are only a few circumstances that most style guides will accept footnotes.</p>
<p>Obviously, citations can go there in some style guides, but there is absolutely no reason that you would need a footnote from a citation.<span id="link[13"><a href="#target[13"><sup>13</sup></a></span> Otherwise, asides are sometimes welcome in the footnote, though, of course, it is bad for bonus thoughts to have their own bonus thoughts in most formal writing. Finally, translator’s notes or editorial comments on editorial or translated editions, counterrespectively,<span id="link[14"><a href="#target[14"><sup>14</sup></a></span> are allowed end or footnotes. I’m sure that some of you have pieced together where the nested footnote is allowed. A translator’s note on a translated editorial piece may need to reference an aside as an aside.</p>
<p>These tend to be ranked, however. They are nested, so there is a clear sense of ownership between first level and second level footnotes. I don’t like that. To me, there are three levels of importance in the words within a text: main text, footnote, and not included.<span id="link[15"><a href="#target[15"><sup>15</sup></a></span> I want footnotes referenced in other footnotes to be on the same level.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as I’ve mentioned a few times on here, this ’blog<span id="link[17"><a href="#target[17"><sup>17</sup></a></span> is written in LaTeX which is then compiled into HTML. LaTeX generally does not have issues with nesting of footnotes, but pandoc does not support it natively. For a while, I thought that I might need to switch to Markdown. Thankfully, I am related to people who are not just infinitely better at their domains than I am, but are also incredibly skilled in those domains on an objective level. My father was willing and able over break to figure out how to let nested end notes be a thing in my writings without forcing me to change from LaTeX. It does require a little bit of change, but that isn’t too much.<span id="link[18"><a href="#target[18"><sup>18</sup></a></span> One benefit will definitely be that the text will stay cleaner, because the bonus thoughts will keep being nested somewhere else.<span id="link[19"><a href="#target[19"><sup>19</sup></a></span></p>
<p>For other examples of endnotes used in creative ways, I have been told the book<span id="link[20"><a href="#target[20"><sup>20</sup></a></span> “House of Leaves” does a wonderful job exploring the limits of the written page.</p>
<p><span id="target[1"><a href="#link[1"><sup>1</sup></a></span> That remains true, but I did say it then</p>
<p><span id="target[2"><a href="#link[2"><sup>2</sup></a></span> arguably<span id="link[3"><a href="#target[3"><sup>3</sup></a></span> the most</p>
<p><span id="target[3"><a href="#link[3"><sup>3</sup></a></span> arguably implies that there are people on both side of the argument. Given that I’m making my own private echo chamber here, I don’t need to do that</p>
<p><span id="target[4"><a href="#link[4"><sup>4</sup></a></span> he calls them end notes. Given that it’s an infinite scroll page, the two do feel interchangeable. Then again, when you scroll multiple musings at once, they do appear at the end of each musing, so end note might be more accurate</p>
<p><span id="target[5"><a href="#link[5"><sup>5</sup></a></span> Like this</p>
<p><span id="target[6"><a href="#link[6"><sup>6</sup></a></span> Like this<span id="link[7"><a href="#target[7"><sup>7</sup></a></span></p>
<p><span id="target[7"><a href="#link[7"><sup>7</sup></a></span> An end note which was called by another</p>
<p><span id="target[8"><a href="#link[8"><sup>8</sup></a></span> such as having multiple references to the same end note, programming his system to automatically skip the number of a baker’s dozen<span id="link[9"><a href="#target[9"><sup>9</sup></a></span>, I think once even having end notes referenced back to the main text, though I don’t recall that in particular</p>
<p><span id="target[9"><a href="#link[9"><sup>9</sup></a></span> the integer between 12 and 14, for those keeping track at home</p>
<p><span id="target[10"><a href="#link[10"><sup>10</sup></a></span> and as someone who has lots of bonus thoughts attached to every thought</p>
<p><span id="target[11"><a href="#link[11"><sup>11</sup></a></span> For some reason my dictionary thinks that endnote isn’t a word. I’ll respect it, for now</p>
<p><span id="target[12"><a href="#link[12"><sup>12</sup></a></span> or, at least, as I know now and have vague senses of having known before</p>
<p><span id="target[13"><a href="#link[13"><sup>13</sup></a></span> I mean I can think of plenty of reasons, but those mostly boil down to like “I do not condone this author’s viewpoints, etc.,” which should probably go in the main text</p>
<p><span id="target[14"><a href="#link[14"><sup>14</sup></a></span> I love counterrespectively, even though I know it’s poor form to use it. It reminds me of how the Majors of Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Biology at my undergraduate were sometimes referred to as Bio Bio Chem Chem</p>
<p><span id="target[15"><a href="#link[15"><sup>15</sup></a></span> Which I suppose should be implicit, given that every work is finite, and there are infinite combinations of words<span id="link[16"><a href="#target[16"><sup>16</sup></a></span></p>
<p><span id="target[16"><a href="#link[16"><sup>16</sup></a></span> I suppose that there is also an infinite amount of nonsense, but that’s its own issue, I suppose</p>
<p><span id="target[17"><a href="#link[17"><sup>17</sup></a></span> I’m using apostrophe because I’m copying my father more closely in this musing</p>
<p><span id="target[18"><a href="#link[18"><sup>18</sup></a></span> Mostly I just have to use endnotemark and endnotetext instead of just footnote</p>
<p><span id="target[19"><a href="#link[19"><sup>19</sup></a></span> Of course, that comes with its own bags of worms, one of which being that needing to type endnotemark, a number, endnotetext, a number, and then my footnotes means that I have a much easier time losing the thread of whatever I’m discussing</p>
<p><span id="target[20"><a href="#link[20"><sup>20</sup></a></span> Book may or may not be the right word. Experience?</p>
