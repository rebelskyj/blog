<p>I missed a day of writing, but such is the nature of life. I had fun with friends and volunteered, which is probably better. My goals last month with their status:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Accomplishments/Finite Tasks</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I played and sang at a friends wedding!</p></li>
<li><p>My talk was written and performed</p></li>
<li><p>My instrument did not run, but it was not my fault finally.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Growth</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I’m once more ashamed of my living conditions, but it’s a faster fix this time I’m sure</p></li>
<li><p>I blogged a fair amount! I also wrote a total of a little under thirty five thousand words. That’s fewer than May, which is a little surprising. Then again, I suppose that I did lose a few weeks of writing altogether.</p></li>
<li><p>Exercise was intermittent</p></li>
<li><p>Sleep was intermittent</p></li>
<li><p>I didn’t make enough time for sleep</p></li>
<li><p>I’m a little under three chapters ahead</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote a song!</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote three letters to friends, though only mailed two.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Looking forward, I would like to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Make my home clean again and invite a friend over. I have actual time in it this month, so that should be easier.</p></li>
<li><p>Continue blogging/find a way to do it during my conference. I know I won’t have time for it next Thursday, because I’m volunteering.</p></li>
<li><p>I’d like to exercise more. Ideally daily, but</p></li>
<li><p>Once again, I’d like to develop a sleep schedule that gives me enough and gets me up early (6am)</p></li>
<li><p>I’d like to make more time for prayer, or at least be more intentional about my prayer</p></li>
<li><p>I absolutely need to get five chapters ahead, if only because I want to start monetizing.</p></li>
<li><p>Doing some sort of poetry each day seems like a doable goal, if not a low bar.</p></li>
<li><p>I would like to get through my stack of letters<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>That seems like a doable set of goals. Today I get to give a talk in a state park again, which I’m beyond excited about.</p>
