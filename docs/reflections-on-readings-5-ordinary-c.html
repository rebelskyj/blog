<p>Isaiah 6:8: <span>“Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, <span>‘Whom shall I send? Who will go for us?’</span> <span>‘Here I am,’</span> I said; <span>‘send me!’</span>”</span></p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today’s readings speak about the nature of God’s relationship with us. As Isaiah was, we are to be awed and fearing.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> As Simon was, we are to be unquestioning,<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and again, fearful.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>But this is not all that the relationship is. For just after Isaiah speaks about his unworthiness, he is made pure.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> And when Simon and his partners too followed God, they are exhorted, <span>“Do not be afraid; from now on you will be catching men.”</span><a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> All in all, that’s nice to think about. We can trust wholly in the Lord our God, and he will make us pure and worthy.</p>
