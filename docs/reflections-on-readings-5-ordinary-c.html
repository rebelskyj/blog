<p>First Published: 2019 February 10</p>
<p>Isaiah 6:8: “Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, ‘Whom shall I send? Who will go for us?’ ‘Here I am,’ I said; ‘send me!’”</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today’s readings speak about the nature of God’s relationship with us. As Isaiah was, we are to be awed and fearing.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> As Simon was, we are to be unquestioning,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> and again, fearful.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>But this is not all that the relationship is. For just after Isaiah speaks about his unworthiness, he is made pure.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> And when Simon and his partners too followed God, they are exhorted, “Do not be afraid; from now on you will be catching men.”<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> All in all, that’s nice to think about. We can trust wholly in the Lord our God, and he will make us pure and worthy.</p>
