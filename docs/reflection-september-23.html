<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Well, another month as flown by, carried away on the wings of time.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> As you<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> can tell from the lack of posts lately,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> there are many updates since the last time I talked.</p>
<p>In short, I:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Bound a book with friends!<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Made cookies in lab<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Did not win a pinball tournament</p></li>
<li><p>Learned blender<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Did a graduate recruiting event/weekend</p></li>
<li><p>Went to a workshop on how to effectively give and receive feedback<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Had a poker night with friends.</p></li>
<li><p>Saw the relic of St. Jude.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s see once again how that compares to the list that I tried to make about things I was excited for this month.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Running more than five miles again!<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Swimming with friends!<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Giving my final talk in the parks for the season<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Coincidentally, this is also the final of the talk series for any speaker.</p></li>
<li><p>Recording a song!</p></li>
<li><p>Being ready for my upcoming talks</p></li>
<li><p>Maybe<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> give or at least hash out details for me to give my first invited talk at a college I do not attend.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Oof ok. So, I did do the first three of those, but I had already done them by the last reflection. I did not record a song, which is a bit of a shame. As you might guess from the lack of postings lately, last month was not a good month for me in many regards.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>I’m mostly ready for my upcoming talks, though that’s a brand new development. Yesterday I gave a practice version of the talks to my groupmates, who resoundingly hated the talk. In their defense, I agree with absolutely all of their comments. They mostly boiled down to the fact that a public presentation should be a story that’s somewhat educational. Instead, all that I had was a list of facts.</p>
<p>As a result, I more or less restarted, this time much more focused on collecting pretty images than anything like having a coherent set of facts. After all, it’s far easier to make a coherent set of facts when you have a story than it is to make a story from a set of facts. I don’t think that I have quite enough content yet, though, so I’ll need to think about other ways that I can pad the content. One option is obviously just to add in some more specific facts about what the different kinds of months are?<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>I started hashing out the planning for the talk I’m giving at a real school. It’s for sure happening, which is really nice. I even have a date<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> nailed down, which is great. Other than that, I vaguely know what I’m going to talk about.</p>
<p>So, what am I excited for this month?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I have a friend staying with me! That’s always exciting</p></li>
<li><p>I’m giving two real talks this week!<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>There’s a cool dinner tomorrow I get to go to</p></li>
<li><p>I’m going to a school to talk to the kids about careers in STEM!<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I’m going to a science fair next week!<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, it’s looking like it’ll be a pretty calm month, which will be nice, especially with how hectic my summer was.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> I’m sure that I did a bad job with my goals last month, but let’s see just how bad.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Finish/make my talk on the eclipses. Hey nice! I did it.</p></li>
<li><p>Make my home clean again. Also did this. Well, at least I made half of my home really clean. It’s the half that anyone has a reason to see, which is good enough.</p></li>
<li><p>Blog more! Objectively, I failed at this goal.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch and exercise more. Technically I did this! I made it to the gym a couple of times with a friend.</p></li>
<li><p>As before, sleep enough, and try to prioritize sleeping earlier. I think I did this. It was hard, especially since I felt like I needed tons more sleep than I should.</p></li>
<li><p>As always, be more intentional about prayer. That was a mixed goal. I started to pray a rosary every night, which is nice. I’m not always praying it well, but that’s progress at least.</p></li>
<li><p>Actually get ahead on my book. Oof. Ok so I did plot out to the end of this arc, but I’m writing so far off of that plan. I’ve been basically writing each chapter as I need it.</p></li>
<li><p>Write more poetry. I did not write any poetry.</p></li>
<li><p>Write or record a song. I don’t think that I did this.</p></li>
<li><p>Write five things I like about myself every day<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a>, three things I’m excited for, and ten things I’m grateful for. Well, I gave up on this quickly, but was then told it’s ok that i did.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Goals for this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Blog more. I feel like this is self explanatory</p></li>
<li><p>Get ahead on Jeb. As above.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep my home clean. I like how it looks right now and I like that I can do things in it.</p></li>
<li><p>Pray better. I’ll need to spend some time figuring out exactly what this means.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch more. I need to start taking care of myself.</p></li>
<li><p>Get back into writing letters to friends. I have fallen so hard off of this, and a lot of my friends deserve responses to their letters.</p></li>
</ul>
