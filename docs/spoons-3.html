<p>It’s been almost six months since I last mused about feeling wrung dry. Then again, the absence of posts does imply something about the post that would’ve happened.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I embroider today? Left it in my car, will try to remember to do tomorrow.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I play guitar today? I did! Not much, but I picked it up, which is good. I should probably replace the strings soon.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I practice touch typing today? I got through Y! That means my newest letter is C<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Reading</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have I made progress on my Currently Reading Shelf? A little! I also started a new book which isn’t the point.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I read the book on craft? Nope! I brought it with me through the day, though.</p></li>
<li><p>Have I read the library books? I kept it by my bed in hope that I’d read it before sleep.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write a sonnet? I did! It was kind of about my research, which is nice.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I revise a sonnet? I really need to learn how to do this.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? Look at this blog post! Extant</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write ahead on Jeb? I finished the chapter due today and started the chapter due wednesday, so kind of, at least.</p></li>
<li><p>Letter to friends? Nope!</p></li>
<li><p>Paper? Realized I messed up a bunch of calculations, which is kind of sad.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Wellness</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How well did I pray? Not well. I fell asleep before starting a rosary last night.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I clean my space? A little</p></li>
<li><p>Did I spend my time well? I tried. I focused too hard on research and lost track of time, which probably isn’t a bad thing.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? No</p></li>
<li><p>Did I exercise? I did the bare minimum, which I’m counting as enough.</p></li>
<li><p>Water? I didn’t drink enough water, but I tried to. It’s hard when I don’t fill my water bottles often enough. Things to think about I guess.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
