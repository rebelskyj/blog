<p>I’m writing this post tonight, but I know that I won’t get around to posting it until the morning. On the bright side, that means that I can write a second draft of it. Today, for the first time since starting the family tradition of Thanksgiving bagels, I made the dough before the morning of. I don’t know if that will end up being a good idea, but I’m glad that I no longer have to start waking up at 3 in the morning to begin all the prep work for the morning, especially since Thanksgiving is always a long day.</p>
<p>This year’s attempt at bagels included potato starch, bread flour, and vital gluten, which made for a very springy dough. I’m excited to see what it becomes.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write 1700 words for NaNoWriMo? Started too late but did it.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb? I might start slowing down Jeb writing, because my mind is blank.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? did it. it’s right here, for all that the post isn’t going up on time.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? made bagels, which is at least exercise. I was well into a cardio heart rate through the kneading.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing better at prayer than a rushed and thoughtless rosary? Not even a little. I didn’t pray it last night.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing a good job writing letters to friends? Nope.</p></li>
</ul>
