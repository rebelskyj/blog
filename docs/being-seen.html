<p>First Published: 2023 December 19</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>I find that it’s always interesting to learn how others see me. I’d like to think that my own self image of myself hasn’t changed over the years, for all that I know that it has. Without delving too deeply into those, it’s been a long and fun journey to really feel like myself in my own skin, which is something I’m glad for.</p>
<p>But, this musing isn’t about how I see myself. It’s about how others see me. I recently realized, after a few conversations, that the way I am perceived is far different than it once was.</p>
<p>Through high school, I think that I was seen mostly as a member of my family. That’s fair, and that hasn’t really changed.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> However, that was mostly among people who were, if not friends, then at least one link from a friend or family member. When people saw me not as a member of my family, I know that one of the most common thoughts was that I looked like a football player.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Even through college, those were both common statements a common statement. More than that, though, I know that I was often viewed as someone who enjoyed violent sports.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The other day, though, I was at a rugby field with some graduate school friends, I made a comment about how I was considering trying rugby.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The friends I was with both expressed surprise, which made sense to me, at first.</p>
<p>After all, I have never once expressed interest in rugby before, as far as they knew.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>However, that was not where the confusion lay. My friends both expressed shock that I would be interested in a physical<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> sport.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>That made me curious. I realized that many of the people I’ve met since starting graduate school express surprise when I tell them that people used to think of me as physically intimidating. I’m only now<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> realizing that this might have been less an expression of how friendly I am, and more a reflection of a change in the way that I’m generally viewed.</p>
<p>The next day, a friend was apparently talking about me to someone who didn’t know me. My friend described me with many of the common descriptors.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Someone who knew both my friend and the new person commented that I have a nice smile.</p>
<p>I did smile when I heard that.</p>
<p>I don’t disagree with the idea that I have a nice smile.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> However, I know that in high school, I was very uncomfortable with my smile. I would do everything in my power to avoid smiling in photos. It does make it a little awkward to show photos of high school me to friends now, though.</p>
<p>Returning to the point, I’m realizing that the way I am perceived frequently differs from the way that people in my life say that they perceive me. I’m sure that there’s some introspection I can do about that, and may in the future.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I embroider today? I did a single stitch so I wouldn’t lose the embroidery needle. I then remembered to take it with me.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I play guitar today? I packed it, which is nice.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I practice touch typing today? Maybe I should delete this goal.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Reading</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have I made progress on my Currently Reading Shelf? I finished the book that I was listening to! And then I finished the first book in a series with a friend.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I read the book on craft? No, but I packed it!<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Have I read the library books? I found a bunch more books that I want to read, which is sort of the opposite of progress.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write a sonnet? Yesterday’s musing was well received. Today, hopefully I’ll get one.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I revise a sonnet? Had so many false starts yesterday.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? I mused, at least.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write ahead on Jeb? I wrote about half a chapter. Hopefully I’ll be awake enough to write a little more before bed. Otherwise, will finish the chapter in the morning.</p></li>
<li><p>Letter to friends? Very no. Visited a friend, though!</p></li>
<li><p>Paper? I realized that I never actually did the calculation to figure out how distortion constants play with the normal numbers, but wow I do not know how matrices work.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Wellness</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How well did I pray? Still bad.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I clean my space? I made so much progress!</p></li>
<li><p>Did I spend my time well? Yeah! I did good.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? Whoops! Maybe tomorrow.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I exercise? Nope!</p></li>
<li><p>Water? I tried talking a few times today, and then chugged a bottle of water because I was thirsty.</p></li>
</ul></li>

<li id="fn1"><p>literally the other day a person approached me on the street and went “are you a (insert last name (not that any of you reading this blog couldn’t immediately figure out my last name) here)?”, which was wild, given that I’m, as far as I know, the only member of my family to have spent more than a week in the city<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>to be fair, I was a football player from middle school through the end of high school, and it was absolutely the sport I felt the most connection to, for all that it’s absolutely not the sport I was objectively best at<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>every time that I use that phrase I feel like it’s the wrong one.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>or something similar, I don’t exactly remember<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>little do they know that one of my favorite babysitters (not the famous movie star) growing up was a rugby player<a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>is that the right word? I don’t think so.<a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>I think that I’m averaging about a footnote per sentence, which says a lot about what I’m thinking in this post<a href="#fnref7" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>literally as I write this blog post<a href="#fnref8" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn9"><p>much as I wish that it was one, that did not include “incredibly attractive”. It did, however, include that I dove, like board games, am getting a graduate degree, and do music. It’s a pretty fair summary<a href="#fnref9" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn10"><p>and not just because it’s rude to disagree with people. I do actually like my smile<a href="#fnref10" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn11"><p>not tonight, though, because I’m tired<a href="#fnref11" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn12"><p>I suppose there’s an implicit thing that I’m dancing around<a href="#fnref12" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
