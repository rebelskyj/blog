<p>I’ve noticed recently that on days where I write more I have less of an interest in reading. This has been kind of nice, especially since I have lately been reading mostly web serials, which are massive time sinks for me. The fact that each chapter is usually five to fifteen minutes means it’s far too easy to lose hours.</p>
<p>Now today I’ve finally had the opposite. I started a new series, and it sapped most of my motivation to write, because the author’s system is really interesting and thought out. I only managed to write half of a chapter today before my ability to craft words felt like it would preclude writing this. As before, c’est la vie.</p>
