<p>Since I first gave up my blog<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, I have started homebrewing.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> One thing that I’ve really enjoyed making, and so have therefore made a few times, is lemon wine. I vaguely follow a <a href="https://skeeterpee.com/recipe">recipe</a>, though I often make it weaker, and I never start with a wine ferment. It tends to end up tasting like lemonade, which is really nice and generally appreciated in the spring and summer months that I’ve made it in the past.</p>
<p>I’ve started a new batch this past weekend, and I’m very excited for it. The fermentation seems to have taken off very well, and I look forward to maybe updating on the results from this as I keep fermenting it.</p>
