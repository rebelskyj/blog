<p>Today, I had the great pleasure of seeing Wicked on stage. It was, as you might expect, absolutely fantastic. The stage was beautiful. The lighting was sublime.</p>

<p>So, there’s a reason for me to be at the Baptist Church, and it isn’t that I’ve had a sudden change of faith. Instead, there’s an Irish Bagpiping group that meets there every Thursday night. They’re an Irish Bagpiping group in the sense that they play the Irish Bagpipes,<a href="#fn013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> not the “normal” Scottish Pipes.<a href="#fn014" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Uilleann Pipes are objectively better as an instrument in many regards. So, I’ve been excited to try them, but haven’t yet.</p>
<p>The first week I was here, they didn’t meet, as it was Summer vacation in London. The second was the same. Last week, I was locked out of my dorm, so needed to find a way back into it.<a href="#fn015" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> And this week, some members of the group decided to do a movie night, so I attended that instead.<a href="#fn016" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Maybe next week?</p>

<p>Prereading note: while writing a different post,<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I ended up needing to deeply nest some statements. I realized<a href="#fn022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> that I had spent around equal time setting up the prereading note to actually writing the post, so I decided to just turn the note into its own post. As a result, that’s Draft 0. Also, since I needed to make sure my<a href="#fn023" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> footnotes parsed, I relabeled Draft 2 as 2/3, since it’s unclear which is the correct term.<a href="#fn024" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Draft 4 remains as such.</p>

<p>Prereading note: this post was written as an assignment, so drafts 4-6<a href="#fn031" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> lack much of my snark and<a href="#fn032" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> will read much more like an academic essay.

<p>Diaries today are becoming more and more of a digital phenomenon. That is, people are deciding to record their thoughts on computers, rather than paper. This transition from analog to digital is not wholly uncontroversial.</p>
<p>Many people have a distrust of digital diary keeping. However, their objections almost always orient around the alleged fragility of digital diaries.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with the Internet, online storage can seem horribly fragile. Unlike a bound book, which can last indefinitely,<a href="#fn034" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> digital diaries require constant upkeep. If written in a word processor, a blog<a href="#fn035" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> post could become unreadable if the file format becomes obsolete or unused.<a href="#fn036" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> But, most blogs are, as the name suggests, hosted on the Internet.</p>
<p>A second concern is that posts on the web may be pulled down or somehow become unavailable.<a href="#fn037" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> The fact that two different agencies,<a href="#fn038" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> both make constant backups of the Internet is seen as a lackluster response.<a href="#fn039" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> And, unlike physical diaries, anyone can access any blog from anywhere and anytime, which frees the researcher from needing the funds to go to the specific library where a diary is held, or find a way to have a copy made.

<p>Since these backups exist so widely, it is far less likely that we will undergo a similar loss to the burning of the Library of Alexandria or the burning of the linguistic library in Brazil.<a href="#fn0310" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Had the files in the library been digital, they would have been hosted in a different site from the physical artifacts, preventing that horrible loss of knowledge.</p>
<p>That tragedy calls out the most important problem with preferring physical media over digital media. Yes, you can duplicate a physical document. If you don’t care about the exactness of the replicated document,<a href="#fn0311" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> it is a fairly trivial process<a href="#fn0312" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> to transcribe a backup.<a href="#fn0313" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> But, as the recent burning of the Brazilian library shows, even vitally important documents aren’t always backed up.<a href="#fn0314" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> The Internet, however, backs up everything.</p>
<p>And to me, the heart of digital diary and the Internet is reflected by this fact: neither promises permanence, only equality.

<p>Diaries are becoming a digital phenomenon. That is, people are deciding to record their thoughts on computers, rather than paper. This transition from analog to digital is not wholly uncontroversial.</p>
<p>Many people have a distrust of digital diary keeping. However, their objections almost always orient around the alleged fragility of digital diaries.<a href="#fn0316" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with the Internet, online storage can seem horribly fragile. Unlike a bound book, which can last indefinitely, digital diaries require constant upkeep. If written in a word processor, a blog<a href="#fn0317" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> post could become unreadable if the file format becomes obsolete or unused. But, most blogs are, as the name suggests, hosted on the Internet.</p>
<p>A second concern is that posts on the web may be pulled down or somehow become unavailable. The fact that two different agencies,<a href="#fn0318" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> both make constant backups of the Internet is seen as a lackluster response. O’Sullivan complains that “the Wayback Machine does not have word or subject search capabilities,”<a href="#fn0319" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>, which would hold merit if not for the fact that physical diaries and libraries also lack subject search without the work of dedicated stewards. Additionally, blogs all have word search capabilities, as modern browsers contain that feature. And, unlike physical diaries, anyone can access any blog from anywhere and anytime, which frees the researcher from needing the funds to go to the specific library where a diary is held, or find a way to have a copy made.

<p>Diaries today are becoming more of a digital phenomenon. That is, more and more people decide to record their thoughts on digital displays, rather than analog records. However, this transition from analog to digital is not wholly uncontroversial.</p>
<p>Many people have a distrust of digital diary keeping. But, examination of these objections tends to show that they are rooted in either classism or appeals to tradition. They almost always find themselves orienting around the alleged fragility of digital diaries.<a href="#fn0321" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>And, for those unfamiliar with the Internet, online storage can seem horribly fragile. Unlike a bound book, which can last indefinitely, digital diaries require constant upkeep. If written in a word processor a blog<a href="#fn0322" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> post could plausibly become unreadable if the file format becomes obsolete or unused. But, most blogs are, as the name suggests, hosted on the Internet.</p>
<p>A second concern is that posts on the web may be pulled down or somehow also become unavailable. The fact that the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine<a href="#fn0323" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> or Google’s own caching system both make constant backups is seen as lackluster. O’Sullivan complains that “the Wayback Machine does not have word or subject search capabilities,”<a href="#fn0324" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>, which would hold merit if not for the fact that physical diaries and libraries also lack subject search without the work of dedicated stewards.. Additionally, digital diaries all have word search capabilities, as modern browsers all contain that feature. And, unlike physical diaries, anyone can access any blog from anywhere and anytime, which frees the researcher from needing the funds to go to the specific library where a diary is held, or find a way to have a copy made.</p>
<p>Thirdly, since these backups are spread over many different servers, it is far less likely that we will undergo a similar loss to the burning of the Library of Alexandria or even the very recent burning of the linguistic library in Brazil.<a href="#fn0325" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> Had the files in the library been digital, they could have been more easily duplicated, and would have been hosted in a different site from the physical artifacts, preventing that horrible loss of knowledge.</p>
<p>That tragedy calls out the most important problem with preferring physical media over digital media. Yes, you can duplicate a physical document. If you don’t care about the exactness of the replicated document, it is a fairly trivial process to transcribe a backup. But, as the recent burning of the Brazilian library shows, even vitally important documents aren’t always backed up.</p>
<p>The Internet, however, backs up everything. Yes, we may not have a guarantee that this generation’s Beowulf will survive if not printed. However, even many of the manuscripts from that time are still gone.</p>
<p>And to me, the heart of digital diary and the Internet is reflected by this: they don’t promise permanence, only equality. Every work hosted on Wordpress, for instance, is just as likely to be there in fifty year’s time. The famous and forgotten will both exist in perpetuity. Therefore, to me, the arguments against online diaries, especially 15 years after the publishing of O’Sullivan’s article, are nothing except baseless fear of the future.</p>
<h1 id="draft-4">Draft 4</h1>
<p>Diaries, like many written records, are becoming more and more of a digital phenomenon. That is, more and more people decide to record their thoughts on digital displays, rather than analog records. And, like the other forms becoming digital, the transition from analog to digital is not wholly uncontroversial.</p>
<p>For many reasons, people have a distrust of digital diary keeping. But, even a mild examination of most of these objections shows that they are deeply rooted in either classist thoughts or appeals to tradition. They almost always find themselves orienting around the alleged fragility of digital diaries, regardless of the factuality of these claims.<a href="#fn0326" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with the Internet, online storage can seem horribly fragile. Unlike a bound book, which can last indefinitely, digital diaries require constant upkeep. If written in a word processor, for instance, a blog<a href="#fn0327" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> post could plausibly become unreadable if the file format becomes obsolete or unused. However, since nearly old computers are still functional, and old operating systems are constantly being ported to new machines, it is unlikely that we will ever have files that we truly cannot open. They may be difficult to interpret, but no more so than damaged manuscripts.</p>
<p>A second concern is that posts on the web may be pulled down or somehow also become unavailable.

<p>Diaries, like many written records, are becoming more and more of a digital phenomenon. That is, more and more people<a href="#fn0331" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> are turning, not to their notebooks, but to their keyboards when they decide to put to paper<a href="#fn0332" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> what’s in their mind. And, like these other records, the transition from analog to digital is not wholly uncontroversial.</p>
<p>For many reasons, people have a distrust of digital diary keeping.

<h1 id="othello-review"><a href="othello.html">Othello Review</a></h1>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Tonight I had the pleasure of watching Othello at the Globe Theatre. In a wonderful turn of events, I was a groundling.<a href="#fn041" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I was right next to the stage, and even leaning on it for the piece of the play after intermission.</p>
<p>Sadly, the set and lighting didn’t blow me away. The lights were fixed and immobile, and the set more or less was as well. What I can comment on, however, was the music.</p>
<p>The show began with natural trumpets,<a href="#fn042" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> which was nice. Come the scene where Cassio becomes drunk, they are replaced with valved trumpets. Before the first intermission, they bring out the cornetti,</p>
<p>In the second act, the cornetti play lamentations as the piece falls to its tragic fate. The ending dance, however, returns with the beautiful jazz trumpeting. Other instruments included a lute during the drunk scene, played masterfully by Iago, drums and other percussion played by instrumentalists, and whistles.</p>
<p>Finally, as is requested by Shakespeare, there is singing. The drunken songs sounded drunk and merry. The whole cast song at the end was sung brilliantly.<a href="#fn043" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> But, the song that struck me hardest was Desdemona and Emilia’s duet of the Willow Tree. They flowed between two part harmony and unisons flawlessly and beautifully. I stood entranced for the first<a href="#fn044" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> time in the show. Nothing existed for me except the two flowing voices and the story they told.</p>
<p>And truly, that’s all that I can ask of a show. There was a moment where time stood still, and I found myself drawn, not into the story or characters, but simply into a place where I feel what the characters feel. Even in professional theatre, those moments can be hard to come by, but the cast brought me nearly to that point time and time again, and to the point in the soulful duet. But, as all good things do,<a href="#fn045" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> it too came to an end.</p>

<h1 id="draft-3">Draft 3</h1>
<p>Today’s Gospel<a href="#fn051" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> reading features one of the two lines that I find most striking in the Gospels.<a href="#fn052" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Jesus exhorts Peter, “Get behind me, Satan!”<a href="#fn053" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Peter, the man who<a href="#fn054" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Jesus loved and trusted so much so that he entrusted the Church to him, is called Satan.<a href="#fn055" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> To me, this truly shows two of the important pieces of my Catholic faith: we are to act and speak as we see true, not always meekly or gently, and that we are to love the sinner and hate the sin. Jesus doesn’t reproach Peter in soft words, or calmly. In fact, he doesn’t even do it kindly. In no uncertain words, he tells Peter that he is sinning.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, 6 days later, he takes Peter to the mountain where he meets with Elijah and Moses.<a href="#fn056" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Even though the Gospels don’t mention it, clearly Jesus forgave Peter for his actions, and Peter tried to accept this change.</p>
<p>This reading particularly speaks to me in today’s climate. We tend to take neither of the two messages we are told to take. We don’t tell the people we love to their faces that what they are doing is wrong.<a href="#fn057" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> We also don’t do the other side of the message, and forgive those who do wrong. I’m as guilty of this as anyone. I judge quickly and quietly, then discount anything that someone who has spoken out of ignorance has to say. Today’s reading was a good reminder to me that I need to try harder to love, even when it’s hard.</p>

<p>Today’s Gospel<a href="#fn058" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> reading features one of the two lines that I find most striking in the Gospels.<a href="#fn059" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Jesus exhorts Peter, “Get behind me, Satan!”<a href="#fn0510" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

To me, this truly shows two of the important pieces of my Catholic faith: we are to act and speak as we see true, not as we see convenient, and that we are to love the sinner and hate the sin. Jesus doesn’t reproach Peter in soft words, or calmly.

<p>Today’s Gospel reading features one of the two lines that I find most striking in the Gospels. Jesus exhorts Peter, “Get behind me, Satan!”<a href="#fn0514" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Peter, the man who<a href="#fn0515" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> loved and trusted so much so that he entrusted the Church to him, is called Satan. This is truly the best example of Jesus saying that we are to love the sinner, even if we abhor the sin. Moreso, it points out to me that we have the responsibility to help those around us who make mistakes. 6 days later, he takes Peter to the mountain where he meets with Elijah and Moses.<a href="#fn0516" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> Even though the Gospels don’t mention it, clearly there was some conversation during those 6 days where the misunderstanding was resolved.</p>

<h1 id="sleep-days"><a href="sleepy-days.html">Sleep Days</a></h1>
<p>Some days you go to sleep, anxiously awaiting the coming morning and day. Other days you wake up, counting down the moments until you can go back to sleep.</p>
<p>There are many factors that can influence both of those, from what’s happening in your life at a macro scale,<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> at a micro scale,<a href="#fn062" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, and how much sleep you’ve gotten the night<a href="#fn063" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> before.</p>
<p>Today I remembered that sleep you miss is at least as important as the other two. I didn’t sleep enough, and so today wasn’t as fully experienced as it could be. I’m hoping tomorrow will be better.</p>

<h1 id="playing-the-ukulele"><a href="playing-the-ukulele.html">Playing the Ukulele</a></h1>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As you many have gathered from my <a href="http://j.rebelsky.com/pierogi-recipe.html">prior post</a>, I play the ukulele.<a href="#fn071" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> There are two reasons I thought it important to bring with me on my trip to London. First, it’s the smallest instrument I know<a href="#fn072" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> that can play chords and harmony, which is nice when I want to sing along with a backing.</p>
<p>The other reason is that I have minimal difficulty playing melodies on it. Whether I’m plucking out an old familiar melody to decide how to accompany it, playing along to my singing new melodies, or picking out new melodies, I can do them all with relative ease. Part of this is that the instrument is tuned to four of five pentatonic notes<a href="#fn073" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> as its four strings. This also means when I want to play something with the dominant as the low note, it’s fairly easy to do, as the pentatonic scale a fourth below C still uses 4 of the 5 notes. The only difference is F instead of E.</p>
<p>All in all, the ukulele is a fun and easy instrument. I would highly recommend anyone to learn it.</p>

<h1 id="arranging-for-bagpipes-part-2"><a href="arranging-for-bagpipes-ii.html">Arranging for Bagpipes Part 2</a> </h1>
<p>As you may remember from my last mention of this topic, some songs are very difficult to arrange for bagpipe. Today, I was lucky enough to find a song that was easy.</p>
<p>I found myself today with the best problem an artist can have: a hyper focused muse. I could not focus on anything else until I had set the hymn “How Can I Keep From Singing” to bagpipes. Unlike the anthem that I previously discussed, this son was far easier. It’s pentatonic,<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and only occupies an octave, from the dominant to the dominant. As you may remember, the bagpipe has a range of an octave and a second starting from the subdominant. So, I put the song in the key of d, added a few grace notes, and was done. It’s nice when things go well.</p>

<h1 id="small-changes"><a href="small-changes.html">Small Changes</a> </h1>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>By now, I’m sure you’ve noticed that I’m currently studying in London.<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> As a result, much of the typing I’m doing here is being done on keyboards with the UK’s key layout.<a href="#fn092" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Some of these changes make complete sense to me, like the fact that the pound symbol<a href="#fn093" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> is much easier to type.<a href="#fn094" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Unfortunately, it’s Shift-3, not Shift-4.<a href="#fn095" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Other changes are slightly harder for me to deal with unconsciously. Next to the single quote key ’, they added in a key for pound and tilde. Instead of shift-single giving you double, it instead returns the @ sign. Thankfully, shift-2 therefore gives us ".<a href="#fn096" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Additionally, backslash is next to the left shift key, and the vertical line<a href="#fn097" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> is shift backslash.<a href="#fn098" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Where the backslash should<a href="#fn099" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> be, there is nothing. Those changes have messed me up more than once when typing a password.<a href="#fn0910" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>I’m also switching to using more Windows machines.<a href="#fn0911" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Commands, especially in the browser I use, are sometimes very different, which is an adjustment. Overall though, those are the main changes I’ve really noticed.</p>

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>I’m currently studying in London. As a result, much of the typing I’m doing here is being done on keyboards with the UK’s key layout.<a href="#fn0921" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> Some of these changes make complete sense to me, like the fact that instead of a dollar symbol<a href="#fn0922" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> being Shift-number, it’s the pound symbol.<a href="#fn0923" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#fn0924" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> Unfortunately, it’s Shift-3, not Shift-4.</p>
<p>Others are slightly harder for me to deal with. Next to the single quote key ’, they added in a key for pound and tilde. Instead of shift-single giving you double, it instead returns the @ sign. Thankfully, shift-2 therefore gives us ". Additionally, backslash is next to the left shift key. That’s messed me up more than once when typing a password.<a href="#fn0925" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>I’m also switching to using more Windows machines.<a href="#fn0926" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> Commands, especially in the browser I use, are sometimes very different, which is an adjustment. The moral of the story is that I apparently don’t notice the big differences,<a href="#fn0927" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> but I do notice the small ones. Am I missing the forest for the trees? I like to think I’m missing the branches for the leaves.
