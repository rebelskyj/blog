<p>Yesterday was another long bus ride. I should really remember to finish my posts before getting on them, because they drain me far too much. But, as it was, so it appears to continue to be.</p>

<p>First Published: 2019 January 26</p>

<p>I learned that for a class I am taking about historical improvisation, I need to learn continuo.<a href="#fn011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> As is to be expected, most of this is scarcely notated, with the assumption that it’ll be composed to fit the performer that day. Unfortunately, as I mentioned to the professor, keyboards and I are not friends.</p>
<p>So, I proposed that I could do continuo on the gothic harp, as I know how to play it.<a href="#fn012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> But, the gothic harp, as one might expect, is not a chromatic instrument. It has seven notes to an octave, which can be tuned. However, that’s really hard to do in the moment. Hypothetically, I could use my opposite hand to raise a note, but that’s apparently not allowed, as continuo playing needs both. This means that I’ll be learning continuo this semester.</p>

<p>I learned two new dives! 404<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> on one meter, and 405<a href="#fn022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> on three meter. They went varyingly well, depending on how well I jumped. But, they’re both in for this weekend, which is terrifying and exciting.</p>

<p>First Published: 2019 January 22</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>The last day of break always fills me with mixed emotions. On one hand, it’s always a change, which is scary. On the other, I really miss academics, and the pressure of needing to accomplish tasks. So, I tend to feel mixed, though more positively than negatively.</p>

<h1 id="reflections-on-todays-gospel"><a href="reflections-on-readings-2-ordinary-c.html">Reflections on Today’s Gospel</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2019 January 21</p>
<p>John 2:3-5: “When the wine ran short, the mother of Jesus said to him, ‘They have no wine.’ Jesus said to her, ‘Woman, how does your concern affect me? My hour has not yet come.’ His mother said to the servers, ‘Do whatever he tells you.’”</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today’s readings are a set that my family has always enjoyed. Mostly, it’s due to the non-sequitur in the Gospel. Mary says that there’s no wine, Jesus says it isn’t his problem, and then solves it anyways.</p>
<p>It also leads nicely into the joke I’ve always enjoyed telling friends when they ask why Mary is such a big deal in the Catholic Church.<a href="#fn041" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Jesus is a good Jewish boy. Good Jewish boys listen to their mother. Mary loves us and listens to all of our prayers. So, if you pray to Mary, Jesus has to listen.</p>
<p>Of course, I have no idea how accurate this joke is theologically, but I hope.</p>

<p>Today I pr’d again, though by far less. My coach says I missed my entries, which is true.</p>

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today, I got to watch my little brother at one of his last high school swim meets. During it, he lost his goggles as he started his 100 butterfly. And then he set a new personal best, by a not-insignificant margin. It’s sad when that happens, because now there’s an incentive to dive goggleless.</p>

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As I mentioned <a href="bus-rides.html">a little bit ago</a>, bus rides make it hard for me to focus. When the bus is totally full, as it was, I find myself completely unable to be productive. So, sadly, the posts were not written. C’est la vie.<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
