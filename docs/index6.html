<p>First Published: 2023 May 02</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>So the last time I can find that I mused about baking, I mused about <a href="baking-take-four.html">a recipe I was working on.</a> Today is sort of the opposite.</p>
<p>I’ve found that<a href="#fn001" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> when I bake bread in the morning, I feel better about the day and I am more productive. To test that, I made bread dough last night and woke up slightly early to bake it this morning. It came out really well, which was great.</p>
<p>While I was making it, though, I considered what I was doing. Something that popped into my mind was a meme format I’ve seen going around a lot for the past few years. The general conceit is that someone is reflecting on how excited their ancestors would be of the quality of their living conditions.</p>
<p>I thought about the fact that I was actively choosing to make bread, not out of any need, but simply with the desire to feed my friends. I worked with finely ground white flour, which I was able to mix using drinkable water that is within my home. When I decided to bake it, I have an oven within my home.</p>
<p>It was a nice feeling, though I think the productivity was a little overstated. I didn’t end up doing as much as I wanted throughout the day, though I did get an early start, which was nice. Maybe my day wasn’t going to be productive regardless of my choices, in which case what I did was the best I could do.</p>
<p>In any case, I got to share fresh baked bread with friends, and that made me happy.<a href="#fn002" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<h1 id="monthly-reflection"><a href="reflection-april-23.html">Monthly Reflection</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 May 1</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>So, you know, I kind of fell off writing this again. In my defense, I did write just under 80,000 words last month, so most of my mental energy was occupied elsewhere. In <a href="reflection-april-2022.html">last year’s</a> version of this post, I set the goals of blogging, poetry, and stretching daily. I also, humorously enough, set the goal of finishing the first draft of the book that I’m now putting out as a web novel.</p>
<p>My goals for the month come in a few shapes.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Professional:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start running my first instrument. I have a conference in about a month and a half, and I really need to start collecting data.</p></li>
<li><p>Finish building the second instrument. More or less as above.</p></li>
<li><p>Finish TA’ing for the semester. There isn’t too much to this goal, since I just need to grade a few items.</p></li>
<li><p>Prepare for a talk at a state park. I can recycle most of my content from last year.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Personal:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Deep clean my home. It’s messier than I’d like.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep up with the book that I’m writing/finish the other one. One book brings me joy, the other doesn’t.</p></li>
<li><p>Relearn bagpipes. I’m playing at another wedding this summer, and I need to be able to do so.</p></li>
<li><p>Practice instruments more. I miss being musical.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a song. I have an idea that’s been floating around for a few days that I think I just need to make time for</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Growth:<a href="#fn011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Make more time for prayer and meditation. I felt better for the few weeks that I made the time to do this.</p></li>
<li><p>Write at least three letters to friends and mail them. I’ve talked to a number of friends who mentioned wanting a hand written letter. It’s fun to write them.</p></li>
<li><p>Blog more. I’d like to say daily, but, as I pointed out a year ago, that’s a strange level of both too high for realistic and too low for aspirations.</p></li>
<li><p>Run more. I like the way I feel when I can run, for all that I hate running. I suppose I could start swimming instead, but.<a href="#fn012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>An actual aspiration: It would be fantastic to hit 1000 pounds in my 1RM for the big three lifts.<a href="#fn013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> In theory I’m at about<a href="#fn014" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> 865 pounds, which is much closer than I thought. If I manage to actually keep up lifting 3x a week this month, it should be very doable.</p></li>
<li><p>Get to bed early enough that I can get up at 6 am every morning. I find that if I start my day early<a href="#fn015" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> by writing or doing something else productive<a href="#fn016" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> I become much happier and more productive for the rest of the day. Unfortunately, that means that I need to be smart and go to bed earlier.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Welp, that’s certainly a lot. Hopefully I manage to do at least most of these most of the time!</p>
<p>Generally, it looks like my professional goals are all deadline based, which makes some amount of sense. My personal goals are generally musical, which is interesting. My growth goals seem to focus on fitness and putting out writing. No real commentary there.</p>
<p>Anyways, hopefully see you<a href="#fn017" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> tomorrow!</p>

<h1 id="on-handwriting-again"><a href="handwriting-2.html">On Handwriting Again</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 April 14</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p><a href="handwriting.html">Last time</a> I talked about my handwriting, I made the claim that the speed my handwriting changes was slowing down over time. While I think that may have been true then, a large part of that had to do with the fact that I had been working in the same journal for nearly two years.<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Unlike that journal, the journal I began around the time of my last post only lasted a few months. Also unlike before, I had no issues finding a new way to change my penmanship. It ended up being a two-fold change.</p>
<p>The first major change is that my handwriting has become much tighter than even before. I attribute a large part of that to the fact that I got 0.3 mm mechanical pencils for Christmas, which give a significantly smaller line, especially how I use them.<a href="#fn022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The other major change was the deliberate change that I made. I apparently didn’t talk about this last time, but I made a goal with myself to change my handwriting in some obvious and notable way each journal.<a href="#fn023" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> In my first journal, this meant writing in all caps.</p>
<p>In my second journal, it was all caps with the first letter of each word capitalized. In the third, I think I added my double letters.<a href="#fn024" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> In the fourth I stopped writing every other line, shrinking the vertical space on my page.</p>
<p>And, as I mentioned last time, in my fifth<a href="#fn025" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> journal, I made overhanging letters. I said then that I would do that with “t,i,s,c,g,j,f still unsure of b,p,r”. The list is now slightly different. I do it with B,C,E,F,G,I,J,P,R,S, and T.</p>
<p>Since I didn’t alphabetize it last time, the differences are as follows. I became sure of B, changed the way that I wrote my E so that it overhung better<a href="#fn026" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>. I became sure of P and R. All in all, not a huge difference between the first pages and the last.</p>
<p>In my new journal, all that remains, but now I write it with a slant. I’m still not sure what angle to my vertical strokes is ideal, but I think I tend to be somewhere in the fifteen to twenty degree range. Comments this week have included <a href="#fn027" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>, “looks like a medieval scribe’s handwriting”, and “it kind of looks like Arabic.”</p>
<p>I like how it looks, though I do think it’s funny that I went from messy and illegible to pretty and illegible. Maybe my next journal’s handwriting change will be legibility to a broad audience.</p>

<h1 id="on-running-another-year"><a href="running-2.html">On Running Another Year</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 April 13</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p><a href="running-1.html">Last time</a> that I mused about running, I talked about the Doctoral Degree Dash that I did last summer. In it, I ran further than I thought I could.<a href="#fn031" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Since then, I’ve tried running off and on. Lately I’ve been more off than on, but even when I try, I find that I can only really run around a mile in the indoor track I’m using before I lose the ability to keep going.</p>
<p>This week has been shockingly warm here, and it’s made me want to get outside and run. So, tonight I decided to run while praying a rosary,<a href="#fn032" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> to see if that could help motivate me to run longer.</p>
<p>In total, I ended up running just under three miles. I think that there were likely N causes to that.<a href="#fn033" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>First, I actually felt like the distance measurement was accurate. When I run on the indoor track, it claims that 6.6 laps equal a mile, but my watch seems to think it’s closer to eight.</p>
<p>Second, the constant variety in an outdoor run as compared to indoors. When I run on the track, I’m running in a small loop over and over, so it’s harder to want to keep going. On the other hand, when I run outside, especially in the latter half of the run, the faster I go, the sooner I get home.</p>
<p>Third, I actually did something with my mind to stop me from thinking about how miserable it is to run.<a href="#fn034" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>I found out my watch now gives me a lot of statistics about my runs. For instance, my heart rate basically never dropped below 175 while I ran, which is an incredibly high feeling number. My pace also seems to be fairly well correlated to my stride length, which makes sense to me. When I get tired my steps certainly get shorter.</p>
<p>Anyways, I just thought it was interesting how different it feels to run outside than inside. I’m hoping to get in better physical shape this summer, but summer kind of starts now.</p>

<h1 id="on-celtic-knots-again"><a href="celtic-knots-2.html">On Celtic Knots (Again)</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 April 12</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As rapidly happens for me, I’ve run out of ideas to blog about. I’ve been drawing a lot of celtic knots again lately, though, so I suppose that’s something that I can talk about.</p>
<p>Something I’ve always wished and hoped for is the ability to freehand celtic knotwork. As some of my readers might have seen on my Instagram page, every one I make starts with a grid and then a grid of circles representing the holes in the design.</p>
<p>I don’t remember whether I started drawing them like this to practice freehand, or if the two just grew together, but I’ve started drawing celtic knots as single lines, rather than the two dimensional ribbons that I used to draw. It’s absolutely helped me with freehanding, though I’m still nowhere near as good as I would like to be.</p>
<p>As I tried reproducing a cross that I am particularly proud of today, I think I might have found a new solution, though. I made all of the beams going a single direction first, and only then went through and added the crossing pieces.<a href="#fn041" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>It worked much better than I expected, though I was still fairly reliant on the grid of my paper. Then again, practicing on a lightly gridded piece of paper is probably my best bet for learning how to quickly find the right sizing.</p>

<h1 id="book-review-of-my-grandmother-asked-me-to-tell-you-shes-sorry"><a href="book-review-grandmother-sorry.html">Book Review of My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She’s Sorry</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 April 11</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>One advantage of the Libby app is that I am able to put a book on hold so that when it is available, I can download it for fourteen days. Since many of the books I want to read others also want to read, it means that I get books spaced out, instead of needing to read every interesting book at once.</p>
<p>One downside of this is that I often have forgotten why I wanted to read the book in the first place. That happened with one book that I read recently, Fredrik Backman’s <em>My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She’s Sorry.</em> It’s the story of a young girl whose grandmother dies of cancer.</p>
<p>The girl is bullied a lot at school, and her relationship with her grandmother revolved around the stories that she would tell of different fantasy lands. When her grandmother dies, Elsa receives different letters that must be delivered to each of the different people who live in the apartment complex with her. Along the way, she learns about the many ways that her grandmother was a complex person who had relationships with everyone in the complex.</p>
<p>I loved the book a lot. The first half or so was a struggle to get through, but I don’t think that I have ever cried more while reading a book. I couldn’t keep tears out of my eyes for around the last quarter of the book. All in all, I would highly recommend the book.</p>

<p>I’ve also started writing another book, which I’m doing for a writing competition. The goal is to write 55,555 words in 5 weeks, and I’m so far on track for it. It’s been fun to try to stretch myself by writing more!</p>
