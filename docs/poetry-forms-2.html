<p>As I mentioned <a href="poetry-forms-1.html">last time</a>, I’m writing through a book of poetic forms. I wrote my first telestich, and it’s a much different experience than writing a typical acrostic. I can think of lots of words that start with almost any letter of the alphabet, but very few words ending in certain letters. The first poem I worked on was based on “church”, which meant I needed two c-ended words and a u-ended word. It took a lot of searching for both, so I think that to make a good telestich the word choice is far more important than in an acrostic. Future poems will hopefully go better as I figure out good words. Below is today’s poem, rough as it is.</p>
<p>Begin and End<br />
In watching water flow and ebB<br />
Or daylight turn to evE<br />
Unlike that last and bitter dreG<br />
Which ends the alibI<br />
I start and hope to wiN</p>
