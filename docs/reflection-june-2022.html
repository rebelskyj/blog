<p>First Published: 2022 June 30</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>So... I took a while off from blogging. I could make a lot of excuses, like that it was the end of the semester. If I look at my daily reflections, it somewhat supports that.</p>
<p>Anyways, life updates.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I finished the semester</p></li>
<li><p>I presented at a conference</p></li>
<li><p>I<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> passed my second year exam</p></li>
<li><p>I played at an open mic with a friend</p></li>
<li><p>i think that’s it</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So, looking at my goals for May, and thinking about that into June:</p>
<p>In May:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Blog daily. I still like how it forces me to think about something every day.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a poem a day. I need to do this more and I will try.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Stretch daily. I like how stretching makes me feel, and maybe I’ll be able to touch my toes at the end of the month.</p></li>
<li><p>Listen to BiaY 7 times a week. This feels more aware of my tendency to listen to three or four in a row.</p></li>
<li><p>Finish a draft of the book I’m writing.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> This may be optimistic, but in theory these past two weeks suggest I can do it.</p></li>
<li><p>Practice guitar every day. I’ve been getting better and I really like it.</p></li>
<li><p>In professional news: finish a reasonable draft of my exam. I need to write this, and soon</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Um</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Did not do, gave up one week in.</p></li>
<li><p>...I completely even forgot that was a goal</p></li>
<li><p>I stretched most days, though I’ve recently gotten back out of the habit</p></li>
<li><p>I think I listened 7 times since then</p></li>
<li><p>I apparently kept writing off and on until the 23 of May, getting up to 74382 words, which is still progress</p></li>
<li><p>I practiced most days</p></li>
<li><p>I just presented my exam, so I guess that counts as reasonable</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Now that I don’t have that existential dread over my head,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> I think I’d like to get back into writing. July is apparently Camp NaNoWriMo, so I would really like to try writing here and a short story every day. I’ve already written a few<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> of them and I really enjoy the fact that it’s done when I finish writing. I’d like to get back to the LitRPG I was writing, but it’s beginning to feel like an albatross. That transitions nicely into my goals for July:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Blog daily. I kind of completely have no idea what happened in May or June because I have minimal records from them. I don’t like that</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch daily. I liked how I was starting to get more flexible</p></li>
<li><p>Be able to run a 5k. I tried one at reunion, and did not do well</p></li>
<li><p>Listen to BiaY more. I would like to finish at some point, but it’s hard to motivate</p></li>
<li><p>Practice guitar every day. I still like the incremental improvements, and I think I’d like to start shifting more up the fretboard</p></li>
<li><p>Practice accordion at least 2x a week. I just got this and I don’t want it to feel neglected<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Write a short story every day. I want to force myself to do more creative writing, especially in short contexts</p></li>
<li><p>Maybe finish the book?</p></li>
<li><p>Finish either of the two songs I’m writing. I started working on a choral setting of Stabat Mater Dolorosa, and I finally put some words and a melody to a chord loop I really like. It would be nice to finish a project</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Ok so having looked at what I thought my updates were, I think there are more. To check, I’m looking at my daily notes for the past two months in far more detail than I did to see why I stopped blogging. Since I stopped blogging I have:<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Seen a lunar eclipse.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Started jamming with a fellow chem grad student</p></li>
<li><p>I think started working out with a fellow groupmate<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Tried recording mental state of the day with my daily reflection.</p></li>
<li><p>Bought a guitar</p></li>
<li><p>Played at an open mic</p></li>
<li><p>Saw my sibling at their institution of higher learning to celebrate a major life milestone</p></li>
<li><p>Joined a new bible study</p></li>
<li><p>Made lemon wine</p></li>
<li><p>Bought new clothes</p></li>
<li><p>Went on group retreat</p></li>
<li><p>Went to a reunion and reconnected with a lot of lovely people</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ran a 5k</p></li>
<li><p>Saw my family</p></li>
<li><p>Got positive reviews of the lemon wine</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Went to a conference</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Met many of my collaborators</p></li>
<li><p>Made new friends</p></li>
<li><p>Tried new food</p></li>
<li><p>Gave a presentation</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Wow that really looks like a lot when I write it all out. Anyways, sorry for rambling, but also not really. I’m excited for the next month of 31 days of writing.</p>
