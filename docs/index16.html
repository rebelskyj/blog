<p>Today, all three of the men attempted to end the meet with the same dive, 405C. One of us<a href="#fn001" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> has thrown the dive at numerous other meets, so it went well, as was to be expected. One of us<a href="#fn002" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> had never attempted this dive before, so it went better than expected. One of us<a href="#fn003" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> had tried it a few times before, so the dive went as mediocrely as to be expected.</p>
<p>In addition, I attempted 205 again. This time I tried it twice, the first was ok, the second one went way over! I almost threw a triple. That’s exciting.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the meet went pretty well. I had some dives I’ve never done quite as well, and a lot of dives I’ve done as well before.</p>

<p>First Published: 2019 February 01</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As I mentioned <a href="reflection-january-19.html">yesterday</a>, this month I’m trying to write a limerick a day. Now, this means that I actually need to know how to write them. The rules of a limerick are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limerick_(poetry)">apparently</a> really flexible, which is sad. Maybe I’ll choose a different type of poem.</p>
<p>I think I’ll instead do the ballad form. That is ABCB, where the A and C lines have 8 syllables, and the B’s have 6 syllables. Since it’s a folk tradition, the rules are pretty vague from there. So, since for the daily sonnet I wrote 14 lines, I should probably try three stanzas of 4 lines, so that I have a smaller number of lines to write.</p>
<p>Maybe next month I’ll try a <a href="http://www.poetrydances.com/nonet.php">nonet</a>.<a href="#fn011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>My role model for this writing<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> reflect each month on the month, especially in relation to writing. This month for writing was interesting.</p>
<p>I failed to write the most days I’ve ever done. Conversely, I still have an average of one post a day.</p>
<p>I also set a goal of writing a sonnet every day. While I did not quite reach the goal, I did write<a href="#fn022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> 24 sonnets, which is good enough for me. I learned that I can write about the everyday events in my life, which is nice.</p>
<p>Next month, I will try to write the posts more consistently for their day. I will also try to write a limerick a day, as that should hopefully be less time consuming.<a href="#fn023" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>I know how snow days work. More or less, it’s when the snow has fallen in such a way that the roads are unsafe to travel. Now, however, Grinnell has a cold day. That is, it’s too cold for the College to feel safe having class. I’m confused.</p>

<h1 id="reflections-on-todays-gospel"><a href="reflections-on-readings-3-ordinary-c.html">Reflections on Today’s Gospel</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2019 January 27</p>
<p>Nehemiah 8:9B: “Today is holy to the LORD your God. Do not lament, do not weep!”</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today’s Gospel reading speaks about Jesus’ return to Galilee, where he reads a passage from the Prophet Isaiah. Here, we see the Lord telling the congregation that, in the words of the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, “in accordance with the Scriptures” he has come and fulfilled the words. All in all, it’s one of the more straightforward Gospels, at least to me.</p>
<p>But, as the first reading points out, “today is holy to the Lord.” We should live each day knowing that the Lord loved us so that he took the form of a man and suffered death on a cross for us.</p>

<h1 id="motivation"><a href="motivation.html">Motivation</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2019 January 27</p>
<p>Prereading note: in the interest of my attention span and available time, I left out a lot of the discussion, as well as a lot of the reasoning I have for feeling this way. Mea culpa.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>To many people,<a href="#fn071" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> there are two kinds of motivation: extrinsic and intrinsic. And, to most of these same people, it’s believed that intrinsic motivation is better. Mostly, this is because external sources may lead you astray or not exist to keep you working, or so the theory goes.</p>
<p>However, I claimed that I am extrinsically motivated. The inevitable straw-man argument came out, namely that since I choose what to listen to, I must be intrinsically motivated. But, that’s not what I was saying. What I was saying<a href="#fn072" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> is that, in my experience so far, I choose activities because of external motivators. Continuing, I’ve realized I even stop doing activities when<a href="#fn073" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> external motivations disappear.</p>
<p>The most clear examples I can think of are why I joined the two choirs I sing at in college. For one, an audition choir, I received an email in June from the director saying that it would be a shame to let the hard work my high school choir director had put in go to waste.<a href="#fn074" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> While getting a signature for that ensemble, my advisor told me that I should also join the early music group. Once in both, I received more external motivation to remain in them than I can think of easily.</p>
<p>Whenever I<a href="#fn075" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> expressed that I felt I brought the average quality of singer down in the first ensemble, I was told that I was a valued member of the ensemble. Whenever any other early musician learns that I play the cornetto, they<a href="#fn076" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> express astonishment, as it’s known as a hard instrument.</p>
<p>And, the final point to making extrinsic motivations work<a href="#fn077" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> is that I’ve learned where to seek external motivators. When I want to feel as though I’ve done a good job, I know where and who to talk to. When I want an excuse to not do something, I do the same. So, while to some, it may seem that I am intrinsically motivated, it helps me live my life better knowing that I am extrinsically motivated.</p>

<p>First Published: 2019 January 26</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>I learned that for a class I am taking about historical improvisation, I need to learn continuo.<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> As is to be expected, most of this is scarcely notated, with the assumption that it’ll be composed to fit the performer that day. Unfortunately, as I mentioned to the professor, keyboards and I are not friends.</p>
<p>So, I proposed that I could do continuo on the gothic harp, as I know how to play it.<a href="#fn092" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> But, the gothic harp, as one might expect, is not a chromatic instrument. It has seven notes to an octave, which can be tuned. However, that’s really hard to do in the moment. Hypothetically, I could use my opposite hand to raise a note, but that’s apparently not allowed, as continuo playing needs both. This means that I’ll be learning continuo this semester.</p>
