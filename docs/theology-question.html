<p>First Published: 2022 October 5</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Currently I’m struggling with a theology question. Apparently animals don’t have immortal souls. So far as I can tell, we know this to be true that because:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>St. Thomas Aquinas said so</p></li>
<li><p>The Church has generally agreed about it</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Neither of those is sufficient in my mind to require my submission.</p>
<p>My logic for why I would believe animals have souls which go to heaven is<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> a relatively straightforward logical chain.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Prior to Original Sin there was no death</p></li>
<li><p>We die because our ancestors, Adam and Eve, committed the sin, and we inherit it as their children. This has been stated by a Pope as necessary to belief, though in the context of whether we can believe humanity sprang from multiple sources.</p></li>
<li><p>There were animals in the Garden</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There are only a few conclusions I can draw from this chain. Either:<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>There was death before Original Sin, and that Bible verse means something different in context/doesn’t exist.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>We have dominion over other animals, so when we became mortal, so did they. Lacking anything else immortal, they were then condemned to destruction</p></li>
<li><p>The Lord chose to create beings that would die in the Garden</p></li>
<li><p>When we were forced out of the Garden, the Lord created new animals which were mortal and lacked souls</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Anyways, fixing my router just now took out most of my interest in solving my theological quandry, so off it goes into the ether of thoughts I sometimes have. I may revisit this some other time.</p>
