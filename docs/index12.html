<p>At this point, I’m more and more sure that I’m the only one who reads this blog, for all that I rarely do so. In many respects, that makes this mostly a write-only space. But, I am currently listening to an audiobook about the creative process, and there are some interesting ideas in it about creativity.</p>
<p>A brief search of my musings<a href="#fn001" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> shows me that I have mentioned my muse in apparently only two posts, both of which are from my initial blog. In <a href="arranging-for-bagpipes-ii.html">one</a>, I talk about how I was blessed with a hyperfocused muse that day. In <a href="making-a-mixtape.html">the other</a>, I mention how my muse should be considered to have the name Janet that day.</p>
<p>The book talks about how writing more makes you more creative, though it does so in more of a spiritual sense than I think I am personally willing to ascribe to it. Still, it made me think about the fact that what I do now does shape who I am in the future.</p>
<p>So, to the future me, I hope that the writing I do now is helping you write better. To my muse, I hope that my willingness to keep writing will encourage you to keep giving me ideas.</p>

<p>Last night<a href="#fn011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I had the chance to watch a fantastic musical called “Come From Away.” It’s about the small Newfoundland town that suddenly nearly doubled in town on September 11, 2001 when planes were diverted to its airport. I really enjoyed the musical, because most of the music was clearly coming from the Newfoundland folk tradition, and there were certainly<a href="#fn012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> a number of nods to that great Canadian songsmith Stan Rogers, with his driving bass and rock influences.</p>
<p>The musical was interesting, especially in the way that it interspersed the serious with the profound with the funny and lighthearted. It gave me, at least, a similar feeling to what it must have felt like to be running without sleep for days in the midst of tragedy and love.</p>
<p>The mix wasn’t the best, but that could also just be where we were sitting. It was a fantastic show!</p>

<h1 id="book-review-of-the-housekeeper-and-the-professor"><a href="book-review-housekeeper-professor-ogawa.html">Book Review of The Housekeeper and the Professor</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 November 21</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>I just finished rereading Yoko Ogawa’s <em>The Housekeeper and the Professor.</em> The book tells the story of a housekeeper assigned to a former math professor who has suffered an accident which means he cannot remember anything more than 80 minutes in the past. The professor is brilliant, in love with mathematics, and a genuinely kind person. Most of the book focuses on the relationship between the professor and the housekeeper’s son, who form a bond over their shared love for baseball.</p>
<p>Reading the book was an interesting experience for me. The last time I read this book was more than half of my life ago,<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> when my grandmother gave it to me. I don’t remember why she had the book, thought I would enjoy it, or what I took from it at the time, but throughout the entire reading of the book<a href="#fn022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, I kept remembering vague snippets of my childhood.</p>
<p>For a book about the lack of memory someone has, it was an interesting metaexperience reflecting on my own lack of memory about my last reading of it. Even without my own personal connection to the book, though, I did really enjoy it. It’s great as a person in science seeing a writer talking about the fundamental beauty of math, and the characters all feel real. More than that, though, most all of the characters in the book are kind people. Too often I find that fiction, especially realistic fiction, tries to paint a world where no one is motivated by the interest of the common good. This book does not do that.</p>
<p>Overall, I give it a very biased score of 5/5, and would likely still give it a 4.5/5 even without my history. I’d highly recommend reading it, especially since it’s so short.</p>

<p>The liturgical year’s last Sunday is always the Solemnity of Christ the King of the Universe. In 2018, I noted that the year was the Year of Grace, though I don’t know what the year is this time.</p>
<p>Something I found really powerful about the readings is how they connect to each other and to Christ’s Kingship. The first reading shows us David’s entry into kingship, which is the line through which Christ claims His. The second reminds us that everything was created through Christ for Christ.</p>
<p>And, the Gospel serves to remind us what the King’s role is. He is not some warlord, conquering nations under a sword. Rather, he dies on behalf of those who revile and spite him.</p>

<h1 id="reflections-on-todays-gospel"><a href="reflections-on-readings-33-ordinary-c-22.html">Reflections on Today’s Gospel</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 November 13</p>
<p>2 Thessalonians 3:10 “In fact, when we were with you, we instructed you that if anyone was unwilling to work, neither should that one eat.”</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As a brief preface, I really only focus on the Second Reading today, and in particular a single verse from it. That verse pertains to the nature of work in the Catholic worldview.</p>
<p>A question that I’ve had for a while is what the Church teaches about intellectual property. So far as I can tell, it doesn’t really have any teachings. The Church does, however, have a number of teachings on physical property.</p>
<p>One of these is that St. Paul’s exhortation requiring people to be willing to work comes with it the duty to give them what they need to work. I, personally, take that to mean that intellectual property also belongs generally to the public. Of course, the Church strongly states that we have a right to individual property, not just public use. The defense of copyright from that perspective is that we have a right to the profit potential of an idea.</p>
<p>For many reasons, that strikes me as a hollow argument. After all, most of the profit coming from ideas is not from individuals, but from corporations. Corporations preventing other corporations from using an idea they’ve created is something I don’t have strong feelings about, but I do strongly believe that an individual working for their own benefit should be able to use whatever tools they can that do not harm another. That is, since sharing information does not take it from the sharer, there is no legitimate cause, in my mind, for people to have the right to hoard knowledge. Additionally, is the right to profit really a right at all?</p>
<p>I am reminded of a quote from <a href="https://incommunion.org/2010/11/24/the-social-doctrine-of-st-basil-the-great/">Saint Basil the Great</a>, “The one who steals clothes off someone’s back is called a thief. Why should we refer to the one who does not clothe the naked, while having the means to do so, as anything else? The bread that you have belongs to the hungry, the clothes that are in your cupboard belong to the naked, the shoes that are rotting in your possession belong to the barefooted, the money that you have buried belongs to the destitute. And so you commit injustice to so many when you could have helped them.” Just as we would say that you should not forcibly take bread from someone with much to give to one who is little, but the one with much is in the wrong, we should not take the intellectual property from one who has it to give to one who does not. But, that’s the great thing about information. It isn’t taken when it’s shared.</p>
<p>I have two more points about St. Paul’s quote. The first is that he does not say that people who do not work should not eat, only that if someone is unwilling to work. Too often, society takes the assumption that anyone not working must not want to work. However, doing work that is not fulfilling to you or beneficial to the community is not work that we are called to do. One unwilling to do this meaningless work should not be punished, at least in my reading of the text.</p>
<p>Finally, just after Paul tells us this, he reminds us that paying attention to the doings of others is also not Christian. That is, he does not say that we should not feed the person who does not work, but that they should not eat. He then makes it very clear that it is not our place to decide who is and is not willing to work.</p>

<p>First Published: 2022 November 8</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Yesterday was my grandmother’s birthday. It’s a strange day for me, because it is a little sad. I still miss her, if only intellectually.</p>
<p>On the other hand, though, I can no longer remember most of what used to make me sad about her absence, let alone her. The only pieces of her voice that I can recall are from the voicemail that my dear brother had<a href="#fn051" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> for the longest time. When I try to picture her face, I can only see the photographs of her that we keep in our home.</p>
<p>It’s strange for me to realize that I’ve been without grandparents for nearly half my life now. A lot of the poems I’ve been writing this month have centered around memory, especially the generational memory that I feel like I’m missing.<a href="#fn052" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> In retrospect, November is a month that always has so many calls to my past, so it’s unsurprising that my reflection<a href="#fn053" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> would start centering on them.</p>
<p>So what is remembering? Is it the emotional ties that we keep to what’s now gone? Is it the intellectual knowledge of something now lost? Is it something else? I don’t really know, but I’m glad I at least had this to reflect on it for a bit.</p>

<p>It’s officially one week into NaNoWriMo<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, and I’m currently doing well. I’ve managed to write at least my word goal every day, and I’m almost a full day ahead now. Since the last time I attempted it<a href="#fn062" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, the website has changed a lot. It’s much more user friendly now, and it’s far more gamified as well.</p>
<p>There’s even an achievement for hitting par<a href="#fn063" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> every day in the month, which has been my primary motivating factor. One thing I have noticed, though, is that the daily goal appears to update based on how many words you have left to 50000. I wonder if that means it’ll set itself to 0 when I surpass the goal.<a href="#fn064" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>Luke 20:27 “Some Sadducees, those who deny that there is a resurrection, came forward and put this question to him,”</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today’s readings strike home for me. Mostly to me, the readings focus on legalism.</p>
<p>The Maccabees could be accused of dying on behalf of legalism. After all, is the commandment not to eat pork really more important than the commandment to live? Similarly, in homilies I’ve heard, I’ve generally seen malice attributed to the Sadducees.</p>
<p>The framing is always them trying to trap Our Lord in some sort of a logical quandary. I guess I don’t see an issue with that. One thing that we know for certain about the Lord and His Promises is that they are consistent. If we can reach different answers from different<a href="#fn071" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> starting facts, that is a legitimate concern about the faith.</p>
<p>And so, I choose to see the Sadducees as truly wondering. In the world view that they have, there is no way for this woman to be married to all seven men, but also no way to choose between them. That’s an obvious problem to the resurrection of the dead.</p>
<p>Our Lord’s response is incredibly stunning. Rather than rebuke them, He answers their questions in full. More than that, though, He answers the questions that they were trying to ask as well.</p>
<p>It really reminds me of how one person’s legalistic question is another’s genuine stumbling block to belief. I saw a post recently that said the incredible specificity with which all of our most dearly held beliefs have is a sign that there’s something wrong with the Church. I see it as the opposite: we know better and better what the true Truth is, because we know what is not it.</p>

<p>First, apparently I never published my <a href="writers-block-4.html">last writer’s block post</a>, and instead linked to an older one. Wild.</p>
<p>Anyways, for whatever reason, I can’t think of what to blog about today. I’ve written over 2000 words of my novel, which is nice, and this is my last activity with my computer before I write my poem of the day.<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I guess I could talk about how those are going.</p>
<p>The novel is going interestingly, because it’s not something that I did even the slightest bit of planning about. More or less, the impetus for the novel was a few vignettes that I’d been thinking about, which had no temporal connection. As a result, writing them results in something very much the same.</p>
<p>In the poem, I wrote a meta-poem villanelle the first day and a sonnet the second. Today I’m going to try a free poem, but who knows how well that will go. Huh, just like that, I’m at over 150 words.</p>
