<p>The liturgical year‚Äôs last Sunday is always the Solemnity of Christ the King of the Universe. In 2018, I noted that the year was the Year of Grace, though I don‚Äôt know what the year is this time.</p>
<p>Something I found really powerful about the readings is how they connect to each other and to Christ‚Äôs Kingship. The first reading shows us David‚Äôs entry into kingship, which is the line through which Christ claims His. The second reminds us that everything was created through Christ for Christ.</p>
<p>And, the Gospel serves to remind us what the King‚Äôs role is. He is not some warlord, conquering nations under a sword. Rather, he dies on behalf of those who revile and spite him.</p>

<p>2 Thessalonians 3:10 ‚ÄúIn fact, when we were with you, we instructed you that if anyone was unwilling to work, neither should that one eat.‚Äù</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As a brief preface, I really only focus on the Second Reading today, and in particular a single verse from it. That verse pertains to the nature of work in the Catholic worldview.</p>
<p>A question that I‚Äôve had for a while is what the Church teaches about intellectual property. So far as I can tell, it doesn‚Äôt really have any teachings. The Church does, however, have a number of teachings on physical property.</p>
<p>One of these is that St. Paul‚Äôs exhortation requiring people to be willing to work comes with it the duty to give them what they need to work. I, personally, take that to mean that intellectual property also belongs generally to the public. Of course, the Church strongly states that we have a right to individual property, not just public use. The defense of copyright from that perspective is that we have a right to the profit potential of an idea.</p>
<p>For many reasons, that strikes me as a hollow argument. After all, most of the profit coming from ideas is not from individuals, but from corporations. Corporations preventing other corporations from using an idea they‚Äôve created is something I don‚Äôt have strong feelings about, but I do strongly believe that an individual working for their own benefit should be able to use whatever tools they can that do not harm another. That is, since sharing information does not take it from the sharer, there is no legitimate cause, in my mind, for people to have the right to hoard knowledge. Additionally, is the right to profit really a right at all?</p>
<p>I am reminded of a quote from <a href="https://incommunion.org/2010/11/24/the-social-doctrine-of-st-basil-the-great/">Saint Basil the Great</a>, ‚ÄúThe one who steals clothes off someone‚Äôs back is called a thief. Why should we refer to the one who does not clothe the naked, while having the means to do so, as anything else? The bread that you have belongs to the hungry, the clothes that are in your cupboard belong to the naked, the shoes that are rotting in your possession belong to the barefooted, the money that you have buried belongs to the destitute. And so you commit injustice to so many when you could have helped them.‚Äù Just as we would say that you should not forcibly take bread from someone with much to give to one who is little, but the one with much is in the wrong, we should not take the intellectual property from one who has it to give to one who does not. But, that‚Äôs the great thing about information. It isn‚Äôt taken when it‚Äôs shared.</p>
<p>I have two more points about St. Paul‚Äôs quote. The first is that he does not say that people who do not work should not eat, only that if someone is unwilling to work. Too often, society takes the assumption that anyone not working must not want to work. However, doing work that is not fulfilling to you or beneficial to the community is not work that we are called to do. One unwilling to do this meaningless work should not be punished, at least in my reading of the text.</p>
<p>Finally, just after Paul tells us this, he reminds us that paying attention to the doings of others is also not Christian. That is, he does not say that we should not feed the person who does not work, but that they should not eat. He then makes it very clear that it is not our place to decide who is and is not willing to work.</p>

<p>First Published: 2022 November 8</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Yesterday was my grandmother‚Äôs birthday. It‚Äôs a strange day for me, because it is a little sad. I still miss her, if only intellectually.</p>
<p>On the other hand, though, I can no longer remember most of what used to make me sad about her absence, let alone her. The only pieces of her voice that I can recall are from the voicemail that my dear brother had<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> for the longest time. When I try to picture her face, I can only see the photographs of her that we keep in our home.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs strange for me to realize that I‚Äôve been without grandparents for nearly half my life now. A lot of the poems I‚Äôve been writing this month have centered around memory, especially the generational memory that I feel like I‚Äôm missing.<a href="#fn022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> In retrospect, November is a month that always has so many calls to my past, so it‚Äôs unsurprising that my reflection<a href="#fn023" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> would start centering on them.</p>
<p>So what is remembering? Is it the emotional ties that we keep to what‚Äôs now gone? Is it the intellectual knowledge of something now lost? Is it something else? I don‚Äôt really know, but I‚Äôm glad I at least had this to reflect on it for a bit.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs officially one week into NaNoWriMo<a href="#fn031" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, and I‚Äôm currently doing well.

Since the last time I attempted it<a href="#fn032" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, the website has changed a lot. It‚Äôs much more user friendly now, and it‚Äôs far more gamified as well.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs even an achievement for hitting par<a href="#fn033" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> every day in the month, which has been my primary motivating factor. One thing I have noticed, though, is that the daily goal appears to update based on how many words you have left to 50000. I wonder if that means it‚Äôll set itself to 0 when I surpass the goal.<a href="#fn034" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>Luke 20:27 ‚ÄúSome Sadducees, those who deny that there is a resurrection, came forward and put this question to him,‚Äù</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today‚Äôs readings strike home for me. Mostly to me, the readings focus on legalism.</p>
<p>The Maccabees could be accused of dying on behalf of legalism. After all, is the commandment not to eat pork really more important than the commandment to live? Similarly, in homilies I‚Äôve heard, I‚Äôve generally seen malice attributed to the Sadducees.</p>
<p>The framing is always them trying to trap Our Lord in some sort of a logical quandary. I guess I don‚Äôt see an issue with that. One thing that we know for certain about the Lord and His Promises is that they are consistent. If we can reach different answers from different<a href="#fn041" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> starting facts, that is a legitimate concern about the faith.</p>
<p>And so, I choose to see the Sadducees as truly wondering. In the world view that they have, there is no way for this woman to be married to all seven men, but also no way to choose between them. That‚Äôs an obvious problem to the resurrection of the dead.</p>
<p>Our Lord‚Äôs response is incredibly stunning. Rather than rebuke them, He answers their questions in full. More than that, though, He answers the questions that they were trying to ask as well.</p>
<p>It really reminds me of how one person‚Äôs legalistic question is another‚Äôs genuine stumbling block to belief. I saw a post recently that said the incredible specificity with which all of our most dearly held beliefs have is a sign that there‚Äôs something wrong with the Church. I see it as the opposite: we know better and better what the true Truth is, because we know what is not it.</p>

<p>First, apparently I never published my <a href="writers-block-4.html">last writer‚Äôs block post</a>, and instead linked to an older one. Wild.</p>
<p>Anyways, for whatever reason, I can‚Äôt think of what to blog about today. I‚Äôve written over 2000 words of my novel, which is nice, and this is my last activity with my computer before I write my poem of the day.<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I guess I could talk about how those are going.</p>
<p>The novel is going interestingly, because it‚Äôs not something that I did even the slightest bit of planning about. More or less, the impetus for the novel was a few vignettes that I‚Äôd been thinking about, which had no temporal connection. As a result, writing them results in something very much the same.</p>
<p>In the poem, I wrote a meta-poem villanelle the first day and a sonnet the second. Today I‚Äôm going to try a free poem, but who knows how well that will go. Huh, just like that, I‚Äôm at over 150 words.</p>

<p>Today is the Feast of All Souls. There‚Äôs an indulgence attached to praying at a graveyard. A friend invited me to go pray at a graveyard with them, and it was really nice.

<p>Another month, another monthly reflection.</p>
<p>My goals were:<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Blog daily. Eventually this goal will happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch daily. I‚Äôm going to stretch right after this, just so I make sure to do it.</p></li>
<li><p>Figure out how to repair/improve my accordion case. I made some notes today, and I think I should be able to get some of it done by the end of the month.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a poem every day. I did feel like the poems I wrote helped me ease into sleep, and they certainly help me write songs better.</p></li>
<li><p>Finish the newest song I‚Äôm working on.</p></li>
<li><p>Make progress on catching up for BiaY.</p></li>
<li><p>Fill in at least 3 more items on my 24 for 24.</p></li>

<p>How‚Äôd we do?</p>
<ol>
<li><p>17/31 blogs. That‚Äôs more than half, so improvement.</p></li>
<li><p>I had about a week where I stretched, so that didn‚Äôt go horribly.</p></li>
<li><p>Turns out repair was as simple as taping it back together, so I gave up on that project.</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote a couple of poems, rough estimate of 12, so could do better.</p></li>
<li><p>I not only finished it, I‚Äôve performed it!</p></li>
<li><p>Lots of progress, I‚Äôm now at day 232.</p></li>
<li><p>I added two new points, so I‚Äôm on schedule if not my goal</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In the next month I‚Äôm going to try:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Blog every day. I believe in this month.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch every day.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a poem every day. I‚Äôm doing a poem a day with some friends, so I‚Äôm accountable there.</p></li>
<li><p>Finish NaNoWriMo successfully</p></li>

<p>Last night went well! I ended up doing my two original songs and Stan Roger‚Äôs ‚ÄúMaid on the Shore,‚Äù because it‚Äôs a little bit spooky, which is good Halloween vibes. I had another person comment that the song seemed incredibly sad, and that I seemed sad while performing it, which is fun. It‚Äôs especially fun because they then commented on how not sad I seem otherwise.</p>
<p>I ended up staying later than normal, and played another set. That one was significantly less prepared, so I did two more Stan Rogers songs that I kind of know. It could have gone better but, that‚Äôs the way the cookie crumbles. I realize I never actually figured out how to end them in playing, so it was awkward.</p>
