<h1 id="draft-1-22-nov">Draft 1 (22 Nov)</h1>
<p>I’m writing this post tonight, but I know that I won’t get around to posting it until the morning. On the bright side, that means that I can write a second draft of it. Today, for the first time since starting the family tradition of Thanksgiving bagels, I made the dough before the morning of. I don’t know if that will end up being a good idea, but I’m glad that I no longer have to start waking up at 3 in the morning to begin all the prep work for the morning, especially since Thanksgiving is always a long day.</p>
<p>This year’s attempt at bagels included potato starch, bread flour, and vital gluten, which made for a very springy dough. I’m excited to see what it becomes.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write 1700 words for NaNoWriMo? Started too late but did it.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb? I might start slowing down Jeb writing, because my mind is blank.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? did it. it’s right here, for all that the post isn’t going up on time.<a href="#fn001" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? made bagels, which is at least exercise. I was well into a cardio heart rate through the kneading.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing better at prayer than a rushed and thoughtless rosary? Not even a little. I didn’t pray it last night.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing a good job writing letters to friends? Nope.</p></li>

<h1 id="something-im-calling-carbonara-recipe"><a href="carbonara-recipe.html">Something I’m Calling Carbonara Recipe</a></h1>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>I’ve mused a few times in the past few days that, although I write a post a day and averaged out, come up with about a post a day, I almost never have a single idea in a day. Unfortunately, on days that I do not have any ideas, I also tend to forget the ideas that I’ve come up with on previous days</p>
<p>I had been considering writing about music, specifically writing music, but couldn’t find a post with that exact title. Searching through early posts on my blog, I remembered that one series I had was recipes I wanted to be able to remember, reference, and rely on in the future.<a href="#fn011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Although most of my food exploration has been slowed in the past few months,<a href="#fn012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> I have at least one recipe that was a mainstay for me for a few weeks.</p>
<p>There are some important contexts to the story of the dish I’m going to describe. First, although I’m going to call it carbonara<a href="#fn013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, I’ve seen a lot of people on the internet get very mad at calling anything that isn’t exactly what their grandmother<a href="#fn014" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> made carbonara. This is not, in any meaningful sense, a traditional carbonara recipe. However, of the pasta sauces I know names for, carbonara is the closest to describing what I cook.</p>
<p>The recipe requires the following ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Olive Oil</p></li>
<li><p>Pasta, I recommend spaghetti that you know releases a lot of starch<a href="#fn015" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Lemon</p></li>
<li><p>Salt</p></li>
<li><p>Egg</p></li>
<li><p>Black Pepper<a href="#fn016" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Parmesan cheese or whatever local variation you prefer.<a href="#fn017" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Optional: mushroom</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The astute among you may notice that there are no specific ingredient amounts here. That is for a very basic reason: I only believe in measurements by the heart these days.</p>
<p>That being said, there are some constants in most iterations of the recipe. I almost always use a single, whole lemon. I tend to use two or three whole large eggs.<a href="#fn018" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Directions for cooking:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Put water and what seems like an appropriate amount of salt into the pot you plan to cook in.<a href="#fn019" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>While the water starts heating, measure out the amount of pasta you want.<a href="#fn0110" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>If using mushrooms, chop them to desired thickness at this point<a href="#fn0111" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Once water is boiling, put pasta in water.</p></li>
<li><p>At this point, we are now on a timer, which is great and nice. Grate the zest of one lemon into a bowl, along with two or three eggs,<a href="#fn0112" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> and as much cheese as it takes to make the mixture into something which resembles a thick paste.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s a well known fact that the two biggest issues that carbonara can face are a broken sauce and a sauce where the eggs have scrambled. To prevent both of these, I recommend vigorously stirring the beaten egg mixture as you stream in what seems like slightly too much of the pasta water, before draining the rest of the pasta.</p></li>
<li><p>If using mushrooms, put in about twice as much oil as you feel like you should use and cook the mushrooms until at your desired level of doneness.<a href="#fn0113" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>At this point, turn off heat on the stove and add the pasta to the oil and mushroom.</p></li>
<li><p>While stirring vigorously, slowly pour in the sauce. If you have done all the steps correctly, it will thicken as the water evaporates and the egg proteins set, but will not grow clumpy. At this point, squeeze either half or all of the lemon into the pot, again depending on how much pasta there is and how acidic you want it to be.</p></li>
<li><p>Serve immediately and eat before the sauce congeals.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Now, there’s a very valid argument to be made that this is not carbonara in any real sense. There’s no pork of any kind, at a bare minimum. Arguably, calling the sauce you make here mayonnaise is not too far off base, since it’s primarily an emulsion of oil and egg.</p>
<p>Taste wise, however, I have no complaints. The lemon zest and juice make what would otherwise be an incredibly heavy meal into something almost refreshing.</p>
<p>Oh, I realize I forgot to discuss the reasons that I started making this dish. Chief among them is the fact that I started keeping lemons in my home. The curious among my readers might ask why I started keeping lemons in my home.<a href="#fn0114" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> The long and short of it is that I had a friend who seemed appalled that I used lemon juice for all of my cooking needs. He argued that fresh lemons are just objectively better in every regard.</p>
<p>Truthfully, I cannot say that I disagree with that take, having now started to use them. Other than that, the main consideration was that I really just wanted pasta al burro<a href="#fn0115" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> every night for dinner, but knew that wasn’t healthy for me. This still scratched the itch, and had the benefit of a number of other macro and micro nutrients. However, I stopped eating as many lemons, and also wanted to eat more different foods, so I haven’t made this dish as much recently. Maybe I’ll start doing so again. We’ll see, I suppose.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write 1700 words for NaNoWriMo? I did. It was a slog and a half, but I did it.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb? I did not, but I’m too tired from teaching my first university level class and driving home. Tomorrow I have less on my to do list, and so I’ll hopefully have more mental space to do the writing.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? Woo! Look at this blog post.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? Still no.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing better at prayer than a rushed and thoughtless rosary? My rosary last night wasn’t too rushed, but that’s about all the prayer I did.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing a good job writing letters to friends? I brought the letters home with me, so I can at least hopefully make some time for letter writing. We’ll see if I do.</p></li>

<h1 id="dungeons-and-dragons-again"><a href="dungeons-dragons-7.html">Dungeons and Dragons Again</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 November 20</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As I said last week, I need to make a new character. Time passing, as it tends to, far too quickly, means that I did not get the new character made at all during the intervening hours. As I start this musing, I have less than 7 hours until the character is introduced to the group, which means that it’s time to generate character which rolls more dice.</p>
<p>I have the following things to optimize:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Race</p></li>
<li><p>Class</p></li>
<li><p>Background</p></li>
<li><p>Feats</p></li>
<li><p>Point buy spread</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I’m level four and get a bonus first level feat, which should help. Let’s start with Race, since I doubt that anything will really change too much. Other than a few racial feats, this is fairly self contained. I think my goal for a race is easier time criticalling, since crits double dice.</p>
<p>Race options that give benefits:<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Bugbear gets +5 feet on melee attacks, and I can think of places that would be useful. Also, +2d6 on a surprise round, which can happen often if we prepare well. It’s a clacky sometimes for sure.</p></li>
<li><p>Centaurs get the option to charge and then bonus attack as a bonus action. Situational for sure but</p></li>
<li><p>Custom lineage gives me a free feat, which can probably increase my dice rolls somehow.</p></li>
<li><p>Glitchling lets me reroll a 9 or lower, increases odds of hit</p></li>
<li><p>Grung lets me add a DC 12 Con saving throw to inflict 2d4 poison damage. I have to imagine most of the time people will succeed on that check, but not always I suppose</p></li>
<li><p>Half Orcs get an extra damage die on criticals with melee weapons</p></li>
<li><p>Lightfoot Halfling can hide behind any medium creature, which works well with Rogue</p></li>
<li><p>Variant Human also gets a free extra feat</p></li>
<li><p>Khenra lets me reroll any one as long as I can see my twin, so if I can convince someone else to play the race, could work.</p></li>
<li><p>Kobold lets me gain advantage on attack rolls proficiency modifier times a day</p></li>
<li><p>Kor lets me reroll every one, which is very strong.</p></li>
<li><p>Green Merfolk lets me hide when only lightly obscured by nature, similar to halfling</p></li>
<li><p>Minotaur lets me use a bonus action to attack with my horns if I take the dash action. Unfortunately, I think that I only get one bonus action a turn, so even if I dash as a bonus doesn’t work sadly.</p></li>
<li><p>Amonkhet Minotaur has the same thing as half orc where i get an extra die on criticals</p></li>
<li><p>Ixalan Orc also gets savage attacks</p></li>
<li><p>Revenant doesn’t work in any way for this goal, but does have the fun benefit of letting me bring my character back from the dead. Could be worth considering another time, esp since they cannot die</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Unsurprisingly, there are not too many options, especially given how many classes there are. Now I get to go through every feat available at or before fourth level to see how they balance, since I think that’ll be more impactful than backgrounds, and the two together should let me figure out my Class more effectively.</p>
<p>Relevant feats:<a href="#fn022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Vital Sacrifice. I can take 1d6 necro damage to deal an extra 2d6 damage on an attack or spell. ok if I build a char resistant to necro damage, that’s legitimately tempting</p></li>
<li><p>Strike of the Giants: prof. bonus times I can add a die roll to a weapon attack</p></li>
<li><p>Squire of Solamnia<a href="#fn023" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> lets me add 1d8 prof. times</p></li>
<li><p>Spell sniper doubles range and lets me pick up a cantrip. Add that to warlock’s um eldritch blast and we get a fun thing</p></li>
<li><p>Sentinel lets me use my reaction to attack someone attacking an ally, or if they leave even if disengaging</p></li>
<li><p>Savage attacker 1/turn reroll my dice. Question becomes what I mean by rolling dice, because wow that’s fun</p></li>
<li><p>Polearm master lets me opportunity attack when they enter my space and also i can bonus action d4 attack. that plus bugbear and sentinel seems really fun</p></li>
<li><p>Piercer lets me reroll a piercing damage die once per turn and adds a damage die to any piercing critical. That stacks nicely</p></li>
<li><p>Orcish Fury lets me add one damage die once per long rest. That’s meh, but better than nothing.</p></li>
<li><p>Metamagic Adept - Empowered spell rerolls a damage die.</p></li>
<li><p>Metamagic Adept - Twinned spell doubles the attack dice</p></li>
<li><p>Martial Adept - Precision attack adds a die</p></li>
<li><p>Martial Adept - Quick toss lets me do a bonus attach thrown weapon which adds the die for damage</p></li>
<li><p>Mage Slayer makes it so I get to opportunity attack any mages in range</p></li>
<li><p>Lucky I’m pretty sure is banned</p></li>
<li><p>Great Weapon master lets me bonus attack another creature when I successfully reduce a monster to 0 hp or crit</p></li>
<li><p>Flames of Phlegethos lets me reroll all ones on fire damage from a spell</p></li>
<li><p>Fighting Initiate - Great Weapon Fighting lets me reroll 1 and 2s on melee damage dies from two handed and versatile weapons</p></li>
<li><p>Elven accuracy lets me reroll one non Str or Con die roll once whenever I have advantage. I’ve seen some people say that means three chances to crit</p></li>
<li><p>Cruel lets me add 1d6 damage to an attack prof bonus times a day.</p></li>
<li><p>Baleful Scion lets me do 1d6 necro damage and heal that much prof bonus times a day</p></li>
<li><p>Agent of Order lets me do 1d8 force damage prof bonus times a day</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Ok wow that’s a lot of options. Best options are those that do not limit the times I can use them explicitly, and come in the category of giving more places where I can attack and making attacks have more dice.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>More attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sentinel</p></li>
<li><p>Polearm Master</p></li>
<li><p>Mage Slayer</p></li>
<li><p>Great Weapon Master</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>More dice per Attack</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Vital Sacrifice</p></li>
<li><p>Savage Attacker</p></li>
<li><p>Piercer</p></li>
<li><p>Fighting Initiate - Great Weapon Fighting</p></li>
<li><p>Elven accuracy</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Ok so I think that it’s better for me to do more dice rather than roll more often. I feel like I generally use reactions and bonus actions, so the second category is probably better Aw shucks, Vital Sacrifice explicitly says I can’t reduce the damage I would take in gaining the boon, which is a shame, but does make sense because otherwise I build something with immunity to necrotic damage.</p>
<p>Most likely backgrounds won’t matter, and I’m very quickly running out of hours to figure this out. I think, at least at the level we are, Fighter makes the most sense. Champion at third level doubles my chances of a critical, and that’s really my only goal right now. For all that Great Weapon Fighting is considered subpar, it does increase the number of dice I get to roll.<a href="#fn024" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>I absolutely want Vital Sacrifice, and then I have to choose between Half Orc, elf, and Kor. If I choose Elf, I take Elven accuracy, which lets me reroll when I have advantage. If I take Half Orc, I get an extra damage die when I crit. If I take Kor, 1 on attacks become not one.</p>
<p>Ok so 1 will always miss, which means I roll no attacks. Kor feels better for that reason.</p>
<p>So I take Kor, Champion Fighter, and Vital Sacrifice. I still have my 4th level feat or raise statistics, point buy, and background to set up. There are far too many backgrounds but here we go:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Astral Drifter gives me Magic Initiate which gives me access to cantrips. Relevant ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Booming Blade: if creature moves after being hit, 1d8 thunder</p></li>
<li><p>Magic Stone: ranged weapons are nice</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Giant Foundling gives me Strike of the Giants</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I think Giant Foundling is the one to go for, especially because it works thematically. Now the question is whether it’s worth losing a level in Fighter for a level in rogue, which gives me access to sneak attack. I’m leaning towards probably not, because next level I get an extra attack. After that, though, might be worth switching over so I get extra dice.</p>
<p>Now time to generate stats and pick a weapon. I want something two handed so I benefit from great weapon master. Maul is the only two handed weapon other than double bladed scimitar, so I’ll take that. Mauls don’t do piercing damage, so that feat is out.</p>
<p>I’m going to do the nice sweet “dump dexterity, max out strength and constitution,” build. Assuming I’m allowed to take variant ability score increases, I’ll have</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Str: 15+1</p></li>
<li><p>Dex: 9</p></li>
<li><p>Con 15+2</p></li>
<li><p>Int 10</p></li>
<li><p>Wis 10</p></li>
<li><p>Cha 12</p></li>
</ul>
<p>From there, at fourth level I want a feat that increases my con by one, and then ideally adds hit points. Something that adds ac would also be nice. Vigor of Hill Giants seems like the choice, because I restore Con and Prof extra hit points every short rest. Since I know that I’ll be taking some damage from my feat, that’s a good idea I think. Oh, I wear chainmail, so Dex doesn’t matter, which is nice. Welp, sixteen hundred words later I now have my initial build for a creature. This took far more time than I thought it would, but in retrospect, I’ve never really read through all the options before. I’m sure that there will come a point where rogue will allow me more dice to roll, I just don’t really know when that would be.</p>
<p>Having now finished the session, things went well. I realized upon arriving that, even though I knew the mechanics of the character, I did not know such relevant information as name and appearance. I looked up Kor, and they’re apparently very washed out elf looking people. Alfred was the only name that I could think of, so that’s what he was named, and I decided that since he was also a giant foundling, he and Goob knew each other.</p>
<p>Anyways, we did not have any combat this session, which means that the only d6 I rolled were to inflict damage on myself with the hope that I might be able to use it next session. It was a fun time!</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write 1700 words for NaNoWriMo? Woo! Found out my plotting included some stuff I have accidentally already covered, so we’re good.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb? I finally finished the chapter that’s been driving me nuts for about a week now. It’s annoying, but I hope that I’ll be ready to do more in the next few days.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? A part of me feels badly about using work I was planning to do as a blog post. That part of me is less tired than the rest of me.</p></li>

<h1 id="reflections-on-todays-gospel"><a href="reflections-on-readings-33-ordinary-b.html">Reflections on Today’s Gospel</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 November 19</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today’s Gospel parable is the parable of the talents. It’s a parable I’ve always struggled with, for a few reasons.</p>
<p>The primary reason I’ve always struggled with it is that it doesn’t account for failure. The two options presented are either making more from what you are given, or not doing that. There is no fourth servant who attempted to trade his master’s property and failed.</p>
<p>I suppose that’s probably mostly just because it would muddy the story. The priest in today’s homily pointed out that a talent is around 100 pounds of precious metal. There’s certainly something to be said about the fact that the rich man trusted even his lowest servant with so much money, and it does do a lot to explain why the servant was so sure he would be able to find it after burying it.</p>
<p>There’s something else in the parable that sticks out to me right now, though. Even though at first the parable appears as a straightforward endorsement of capitalism, there are limits.</p>
<p>The first servant doubles his five talents to ten. That’s a 100 percent increase. However, he stops at that single doubling.</p>
<p>Some might argue that the market forces<a href="#fn031" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> would not support someone creating so much more than five talents of wealth. Ten talents might exhaust the field, creating a monopoly. The second servant, however, starts with two.</p>
<p>When he doubles his starting value, he has nearly as much as the first servant was given. If the message of the parable is that more is always better, then he should absolutely have doubled his investment again. And yet, he didn’t.</p>
<p>Now, as Catholics, we know a priori<a href="#fn032" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> that unbridled capitalism is not good.<a href="#fn033" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>In the context of what I assume we’re supposed to read the parable as, treating talents in the modern sense, rather than as a concept of wealth, it is a relieving distinction. Whatever gifts we are given are not needed to expand exponentially forever. As someone who finds that they’re constantly disappointed in lack of progress, that is a relieving proposition.</p>
<p>Of course, I mentioned at the beginning of this post that it bothers me that there is never an unsuccessful servant. Within the context of the parable, that does not necessarily hold. Those who try do not always succeed.</p>
<p>However, this is one of the places that<a href="#fn034" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> the fact that the story is a parable answers the question.<a href="#fn035" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> If our work is to use our talents for the building of the Kingdom, then there is no way for our work not to prosper.</p>
<p>They say that the road to hell is paved in good intentions. That may be true, but intentions are not action. To strive earnestly for a better world, with an open heart and mind, is to make the world a better place. Even if we do not see the ways in which our work helps those around us, we can be assured that there is no good we do which does not multiply to infinity.</p>
<p>As much as I want to go and read the reflections of great thinkers of the Church on this parable, I know that I need to take the advice I said above and not push for the sake of pushing. There are more upcoming hours in the day, and I hope that I will have the energy I need to do that reflection, but I will not count on it.</p>
<p>Update: I had my weekly bible study. This week, not all of the students were available, so we joined with another group. It is really interesting to see how much quieter my students are when surrounded by strangers. Even on the first day, when we were just meeting for the first time, they seemed much more willing to speak up than they were today.</p>
<p>I really hope that the same is not true for the other class’s students. I would hate to think that my being there made them uncomfortable sharing what they thought. Still, what little that each of the students said remained very well thought out.</p>
<p>Since I didn’t fill this out yesterday, two days of Daily Reflections:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write 1700 words for NaNoWriMo? I did yesterday, I have not yet today. As I said, though, there are a number of hours, which I hope to have time to do. Update: I have now written the words for the day. I’m starting to fall behind my plotting, which isn’t ideal, but is probably fine.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb? I wrote about 500 words yesterday. I wanted to write more, but I felt like the pace I was trying to set was much faster than the pace that I needed to write for the scene, which really deserved and demanded a lot of focus. As I said last week, I’m not going to write Jeb on Sundays, and I’m going to hold myself to that.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? Technically I blogged yesterday, for all that it was a few words. I also, as you can see, blogged here.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? I stretched my neck when stopped at stoplights.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing better at prayer than a rushed and thoughtless rosary? I think I fell asleep in the middle of my rosary on Friday, and I didn’t do one last night.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing a good job writing letters to friends? No. I have carried an unwritten letter with me for more than a week at this point, at every stop planning sincerely to write it.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Tonight I saw the same version of Twelfth Night that I saw <a href="twelfth-night.html">just over five years ago.</a> Of course, the cast and location were completely different. I didn’t think that I remembered any part of the show, but every time I heard one of the<a href="#fn041" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> musical numbers, it was like I was transported back to my time in London.

<p>Much like my musings in those days, I find that it’s late enough I have nothing else to say. Tomorrow I’ll do a comparative review, but tonight I must sleep.</p>

<h1 id="flash-fiction-friday"><a href="flash-fiction-227.html">Flash Fiction Friday</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 November 17</p>
<h1 id="draft-2-18-november-2023">Draft 2: 18 November 2023</h1>
<p>I find that I’m struggling to begin this second draft. On the one hand, I want to simply reflect on what I wrote last night. On the other, a reflection is its own post, not a new draft of a post. So, let’s rewrite my very scattered thoughts from last night into something a little more coherent, and then reflect?<a href="#fn051" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>As I mentioned <a href="flash-fiction.html">last Friday,</a> there is a weekly writing event called Flash Fiction Friday. I really like it as a concept, especially since they limit submissions to 100-1000 words. There’s something really nice about having to tell my narrative in such a tight format.</p>
<p>This week is apparently the 227th that they’ve put out a prompt. The prompt was “sands of time.” My mind immediately leapt between a number of ways that I could respond to the prompt, and I think it could be interesting to reflect on some of how my creative process works, if only to see if it helps me to construct narratives better in the future.</p>
<p>I do not think that I am alone in first thinking about an hourglass when thinking about the sands of time. There are so many ways that the concept is used in fiction that I’ve loved. Right now,<a href="#fn052" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> the first usage that popped into my head was Death in Discworld.<a href="#fn053" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>I’ve taken to rejecting the first idea that pops in my head reflexively. The second idea that pops into my head, by contrast, gets an inordinate amount of consideration. Yesterday, my second thought was how glass and sand relate.</p>
<p>As most people know, when you melt sand down, you get glass. As a person who has taken some coursework in material science, though, I am fascinated by the way that they two substances are so fundamentally different. Sand is crystalline, which in some circles of the world means that it is solid.<a href="#fn054" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> However, in bulk, sand behaves like a liquid. You can pour it, and it does not hold together without something to bind it.</p>
<p>Glass, by contrast, is definitionally a glass material.<a href="#fn055" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> It behaves, on incredibly long timescales, almost as though a liquid. This is because<a href="#fn056" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> it is completely amorphous.</p>
<p>An interesting consequence of this fact is that glass, even when ground down to particles the same size as the sand it was initially formed from, does not return to being sand. Instead, the tiny beads of glass remain completely amorphous. Now, I’m certain that over some time scale they eventually reconvert to crystalline, if only because I know a priori that a lot of the sand is, in fact, crystalline.<a href="#fn057" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>With that fact in mind, I started to think about what the metaphor becomes with sand and glass. Sand is a collection of completely discrete and stable particles. Glass is something solid and yet not static at all.</p>
<p>From there, my mind immediately moved to glass as memory. Memories feel and seem stable, but there countless studies that show how intrinsically fluid they are. At that point, I had sand as moments of time, and glass as the meaning someone constructs.</p>
<p>I tried framing the story in a few ways, though I ultimately ended up with something that felt more like literature or philosophy than a short work of fiction.<a href="#fn058" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> I ended my musing by saying both that I would read the post in the morning, and that I thought I would dislike it.</p>
<p>The friend I’m writing with this morning and early afternoon read my post and asked me to expound on my claim that “here is no genuine way to express something complex.” So, let’s go through the post and see what we think.</p>
<p>I feel like it’s a really rough post. As I said, there was not really a narrative. Reading it today, it really feels like what I have is the bones of a story, rather than the story itself. That being said, I don’t find it pretentious, which is a nice change.</p>
<p>Alright, let’s explore why I feel like expressing complexity inherently relies on artifice. I find that I’m immediately drawn to a conversation I had with a friend on Wednesday. As it turns out, this friend has a degree in poetry<a href="#fn059" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>, and he told me about an experience he had in one of his upper level classes.</p>
<p>One of his classmates refused to rewrite any poem. The classmate tried to justify it by saying that the poem expressed what it tried to express. To edit a poem was to compromise the artistic vision.</p>
<p>That anecdote came as we discussed the way that learning to revise is such a difficult skill. Separating the created work from the inspiration of creation is a difficult endeavor, especially as the creator.</p>
<p>I’m struggling to articulate how that prior sentence connects to my feeling of artifice. I think that, at first, everything is black and white, at least to me.<a href="#fn0510" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> To add nuance is to explicitly reject the initial impression.</p>
<p>I suppose that takes us to the question of what genuine means. Is my most genuine reaction the first impulse I have, or is it what I decide to believe when I have the chance to explore the consequences of each belief? I don’t have a good answer, for all that I have some more ways of musing about the difficulty of being genuine and nuanced.</p>
<p>I’ll use an example from my own life. When I write these posts, I often start by using identifying information about the people in my life. However, I do not want to harm them in the real world, and I know that there is a chance that anything I say here, regardless of how innocuous it feels at the time, could later come back to haunt one of the two of us. With that in mind, I scrub the identifying information as best as I can, until I’m sure that sometimes I’ve referenced people in a way that they would not even recognize as themselves if they were to read my blog.</p>
<p>As I keep writing each post, though, I fall into the mindset of anonymizing information. By the end of each draft, I instinctively write about others in a way that makes them faceless beings who exist solely in the context of the narrative I’m telling.<a href="#fn0511" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Which register of my writing is the real me? Is it the one who uses friend’s names, or the one who writes this blog?</p>
<p>I find that my gut reaction is to say, here, at least, the way that I construct the narrative as I write it is the genuine article. At the beginning of the post, the real me refers to friends by names. By the end of the post, the real me refers to friends only in how they intersect the story.</p>
<p>When I go back to add nuance, however, I have to choose which register to use for the entirety of the post. Since I made the conscious decision long ago to have this blog not name others explicitly, that is the register I shift things to. Given that I write each musing with the understanding that it will be posted, there’s an easy argument to be made that what I meant to construct from the beginning was something that did not refer to people by name.</p>
<p>Abstracting back to the general question of what it means to be genuine, there is a tension between what is created and the vision. Naively, the creation feels like the most genuine version of an act of creation. After all, there is no way to perfectly recreate the conditions that lead to every decision we make. No man can cross the same river twice, and everything we effect affects us.<a href="#fn0512" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>However, like most naive conceptions, that idea does not hold up perfectly to scrutiny. If I write a song about love, I almost always want there to be rhyme, because I feel like the sing songy nature of rhyming couplets fits well with my conception of what a love song should be. If I end my first line with something difficult to rhyme, though, it does not compromise the idea to change that word.</p>
<p>After rambling far further than I meant to for a revised and trimmed draft, I think I do believe it’s possible to discuss something complex in a genuine fashion. I think that it requires a separation of intent from creation, though, which feels artificial in a lot of contexts.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>It’s another Friday, which means that it’s time for another musing about the Flash Fiction I’m planning to write today. It’s far later than I’d like to be starting this musing, but I don’t regret the time that I spent doing other things today.<a href="#fn0513" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> The prompt today is “sands of time.”</p>
<p>Probably because I have thought about sand for the book I’m writing<a href="#fn0514" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>, I immediately thought about the fact that sand is crystalline, while glass is amorphous. While walking home, I considered a little more in depth how I could use that to a narrative.</p>
<p>I think that there’s something to the idea of each individual grain of sand being an explicit passage of time. Regardless of how we feel about it, there exists an objective way to measure the time displacement that occurs on earth. What’s more meaningful by far, though, is the way that we turn these objective passings into a narrative. I’m not entirely sure how to make fire or heat into the metaphor, but maybe there’s something about lightning which forms fulgerites.</p>
<p>Ok actually, I love the idea of fulgerites.</p>
<p>So, let’s reconstruct the narrative from there. A fulgerite is a place where lightning has melted and reformed the sand into an interesting shape. Sand, as sort of given in the prompt, is the passing of time. Lightning is a person constructing meaning out of a series of events. The result is a memory.</p>
<p>This feels like something that might be better expressed as a poem, for all that I refuse to do this as anything but prose.<a href="#fn0515" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Ok, let’s go through the same sets of questions I asked myself last week. My FFF question set apparently is:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Why am I writing it? Today, because I want to explore this idea of time as observation. I’m realizing that a lot of how I view myself as a more literary writer is by emphasizing the importance of observation and human naming. That’s probably worth interrogating on another occasion.<a href="#fn0516" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Person? Right now I’m leaning towards a third/fourth person telling.<a href="#fn0517" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Any other gimmicks? I don’t think so today.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Alright, time to try writing this. I think that I’ll let it be more poetic in phrasing than I tend to emphasize, in large part because I find that I wax poetic the later at night it is.<a href="#fn0518" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Well, I wrote it, and redrafted it at least four times. I switched between first and third person accounts of the narrative as I went through the different drafts, which I think did a lot to help me tell the story that I wanted. In my author’s note, I admitted that I don’t know if what I wrote really counts as prose or poetry, but I am as happy with it as I think I will be. I’m sure that in the morning I’ll read what I wrote and feel like it was too pretentious or trying too hard to be deep.<a href="#fn0519" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>It’s now well past time for sleep, so I’ll do my questions and head. Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write 1700 words for NaNoWriMo? I did! I’m now officially a full day ahead of schedule.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb? I wrote my ideas for the chapter and about 500 words of content. As I mentioned at the top, today was far longer than I planned on, for all that I do not regret it.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? I’m realizing that I can use footnotes for all my long diversions, which lets my actual text be<a href="#fn0520" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> more coherent.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? No.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing better at prayer than a rushed and thoughtless rosary? No? I feel like I’ve thought about my place in the universe a fair amount, which involves a certain level of prayerful intention for me, but I haven’t done anything explicitly so.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing a good job writing letters to friends? Today passed too quickly. Yesterday I mentioned making a to do list, and that did absolutely help a lot. Tomorrow I plan to spend a fair amount of time writing with my friend, which should give me the space I need to get through the chapter of Jeb I’d like to write, the NaNo writing I need to do, and the letter that I feel like I should write.<a href="#fn0521" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> Should is probably the wrong word. At this point, I’ve written all the letters to people I felt an obligation to write. What’s left is the letters I want to write. Framing it that way is probably healthier.</p></li>

<li id="fn058" role="doc-endnote"><p>the line between the three is incredibly hazy, I’ll happily admit.

Actually, as I think about it, that tends to separate the prose and poetry I write from a lot of what I think of when i think of literature or philosophy. There tends to be explicit change in the writing I do, a way in which the world the story or poem is placed has changed as a result of the story being told. (That phrasing works with my apparent goal for FFF, which is trying to find a way to describe the fact that the action of assigning meaning is, itself, meaningful.)<a href="#fn05ref8" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn0512" role="doc-endnote"><p>ooh I love that ending phrase, for all that I also know I would hate having to read it<a href="#fn05ref12" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0513" role="doc-endnote"><p>more or less from 4:30 on tonight I’ve been celebrating a close friend’s birthday, and that seems more important to me than an arbitrary writing goal. I’m sure that there’s something to be said about finding a balance for writing where it can be the main thing that I do, but still takes a backseat to the important parts of my life. I should reflect on that further, and this footnote feels like as good of a place as any to do so. (I don’t want the main content of this blog post to be my reflection on writing, because I decided arbitrarily that it would be planning for the flash fiction (as you might have seen from the opening line))</p>
<p>I do very much appreciate the fact that I write. I love looking back at the content I’ve read, and there’s a part of me that beams whenever someone tells me they’ve enjoyed anything I’ve written. I can look at the writing I’ve done through the years and see a clear upward trend in quality, or at least quality per unit time. I feel like, at a general level, at least, the second draft of anything non fiction I write is about twice as good as the first draft, and it often takes far less time. However, all the content that goes into the first draft is important.</p>
<p>Last week’s musing on the readings is a great example. Before I had written the very long reflection, I don’t think that I would have gotten to the musing that I had. The second draft is strong, in large part, because the first draft is willing to take so many detours.</p>
<p>So, how do I square that reality with the fact that I find my writing improving? There are two ways. First, I find that the rabbit holes my mind explores are generally better the more I’ve written and read in my life. I continue to grow as a person, and continue to find better ways to express a truth that I see or feel or believe. Second, I get through each diversion more quickly. For all that I am willing to ramble through these musings, I strongly prefer being able to do them in a single sitting. The composite reality that the more I write, the more comfortable I am with spending a continuous amount of time writing and the fact that the more I write the physically faster I write means that I get through a lot more content in a first draft of a rambling musing. There’s the part I’m not addressing here which is that the quality of my first drafts is also increasing a fair amount, simply because my mind is getting better at plotting how a small narrative will end from a beginning.</p>
<p>All this to say, I think that the healthiest thing for me is to have writing be an important part of my life, but a part that is always able to be superseded by a friend or other social event. I know myself well enough to know that I am healthier when I spend more time with friends.<a href="#fn05ref13" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<h1 id="ib-thesis-prep"><a href="thesis-prep.html">Ib Thesis Prep</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 November 16</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>his morning, after my more or less daily writing session for NaNoWriMo<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, I realized that I had no clue what I wanted to write about tonight. It was suggested that I could muse on fan fiction, generally as a concept, and that seemed like a strongly potential idea.</p>
<p>However, my day ended up being far more eventful than I had expected. I’ll go through the particularly notable events as a series of vignettes, before seeing if I have something I can find a title for as a musing. If not, hopefully I’ll be inspired to find something to muse about from my journaling here.<a href="#fn062" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>While walking to work, I realized that I haven’t updated my yearly goals, which is a big oopsie. It’s a little late for that<a href="#fn063" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, but I put it on my to do list for tomorrow, so hopefully I remember to do it. Anyways, among the exciting things of the day was reading a really interesting old paper.</p>
<p>The paper itself was fun, but it cited a few textbooks for explanations of derivations. As it turns out, the textbooks were simply early quantum texts, and just framed how the Born Oppenheimer approximation<a href="#fn064" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> is justified. I realized how much I really appreciate older textbooks. There are absolutely a number of reasons for that. One major one, I realized today, is due to the limits of the system.</p>
<p>I read recently about how absolutely weird it really is that we can have so many images in all of our scientific papers these days. In earlier times, it was a massive pain to get images into books, especially if you didn’t want to dedicate an entire page to them. As a result, rather than simply being able to go “as you can see from the graphs,” authors had to consider how to best<a href="#fn065" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> communicate information without visuals.</p>
<p>I think that there’s also an element of novelty that modern textbook authors miss. The textbook I read today, for instance, explained that it is clear that there is an optimal location for all the nuclei in a molecule that is neither totally compressed<a href="#fn066" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> nor infinitely separated<a href="#fn067" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>. I said that to my group mates, and most of them rolled their eyes and said it was obvious. It is obvious, to me, who has now taken three semesters of explicitly quantum chemistry and had the concept implicitly taught in any other number of courses. If it was my first semester in quantum, though, I think that framing would be helpful. That is, we know that there is an optimal structure, and we can constrain it slightly.</p>
<p>Honestly, I kind of just want to go into my rant right now, but I said I’d do a few vignettes, so we’ll rush through them. Probably because of the way I loved the textbook, a few group members started to joke about how long my thesis will be. One phrase that came up more than once is “you should really be getting a degree in philosophy”, which makes me kind of sad. The degree that I’m going for is explicitly a doctorate of philosophy. Just because the modern world has moved past the idea that a Ph. D. is meant to represent philosophical reflections on the field, I don’t see why I need to.</p>
<p>Anyways, I realized that there are a number of ways that I could write an absurdly long thesis, if I felt so called.<a href="#fn068" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> There are a few ways that I could pad the length, which I will discuss after finishing vignettes.</p>
<p>I then found out that my choir rehearsal was cancelled for the night. Almost immediately after that, someone in the choir asked if I wanted to sign up for a date auction with them. I had no reason to say no, said yes, and then went to a young adult social night, which was really fun.</p>
<p>I also went to a cool seminar and got lunch with the seminar speaker today. I think that’s most of the vignettes. Onto the meat of today’s post: my path to an infinite thesis.</p>
<p>There are really two paths that can increase the length of my thesis: going deeper and going wider. To go wider is easy, I just have to make a wider claim of what I did that is relevant to my degree. Since I have given talks as part of my degree on a variety of subjects, there is an argument to be made that I should<a href="#fn069" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> dedicate some space to them. Of course, a long discourse on tuning theory may feel slightly off tone in a chemistry dissertation, which is where going deeper goes.</p>
<p>Going deeper can mean a lot of different things. Especially since I’m doing a fairly heavy computational project, I feel like having a description of how we can start at a molecule and get to rotational numbers would not be bad. However, since I like to take things to an extreme level, there are other ways we can frame it.</p>
<p>One joking idea was the history of the universe as seen through the lens of rotational spectroscopy.<a href="#fn0610" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> In the beginning, there was the big bang. There were no molecules, so it’s not interesting.</p>
<p>The first stars formed. They also didn’t have any molecules with dipoles, at most having diatomic hydrogen, so are also not interesting.<a href="#fn0611" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Then the stars exploded. Those are all ions and atoms, so not interesting.<a href="#fn0612" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>As much as I think that could be a fun thing to do, and may try as a creative writing exercise, that is not quite as academic as many might want for a thesis.<a href="#fn0613" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> However, there’s another way to go deeper. As I said, I could go through how we go from a molecular structure to rotational constants.</p>
<p>There’s no reason that I need to stop at molecular structure, though. We could go one layer deeper, to how atoms create molecules. Now, if I were a particle physicist, I could go the step lower to how atoms are constructed, but, again, the degree is philosophy. Especially since the conception of an atom is an interesting historical trail, it could be fun to trace that. One other cool thing could be to take some metaphysics.</p>
<p>I could<a href="#fn0614" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> go into a whole discourse on what matter is, not as a matter of physics but as a philosophical thing. I did say a few times that one goal I have for a thesis is that I can<a href="#fn0615" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> use it as a text for any course I could likely teach in the future. Now, does anyone really think that’s an appropriate idea? I sure kind of do, but I don’t know if it will be approved.</p>
<p>Oh! Right, I was going to rant about modern textbook design. I think another issue is that people today are too afraid of using words. There are reasons for this, to be sure.</p>
<p>First and foremost, writing is no longer emphasized at any real level of education for a growing scientist. You can see this in who gets recruited for technical writing. Companies find it easier to teach English majors science than science majors how to write.</p>
<p>It goes deeper than that, though. I think that most of the scientists I know only try to speak to other members of the field.<a href="#fn0616" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> There are shades of this, obviously.</p>
<p>I’m only going to be writing to people fluent in English, for instance. That does cut out a large portion of the world. If I cut it down to chemists who understand basic chemical nomenclature, that cuts it down significantly again. Most people would argue that a Ph. D. thesis can be targeted to at least the level of an upperclassman undergraduate in a field, though.</p>
<p>The issue I have is that people go even further than that. They repeatedly use phrases that only have meaning to people within their own specific subfield, sometimes to the point that there are maybe twenty people in the world who can understand the jargon. In a research paper, I can understand and even respect that choice. After all, a research paper is meant to focus towards the field. There are other avenues to share research with the broader public.<a href="#fn0617" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>I think that in a lot of people’s views, a thesis is just a continuation of that thought. Ok, think is probably a bit of an understatement. Given that the prevailing way to construct a thesis that I’ve seen recently is just stapling papers together, it is exactly the thought process.</p>
<p>Ope I never said why I respect the choice. Jargon has a purpose, and I will never deny it. There are shades of meaning, and it is far more efficient and effective to use a word with shared meaning rather than dancing one’s way around it for a paragraph. If I want to talk about benzene, for instance, there is no reason that I should have to describe it as a structure where each of six carbons is joined in a ring with on average one and a half bonds to its two neighbors.<a href="#fn0618" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> If I’m going to talk about benzene to a broader audience, though, I might need to do that.</p>
<p>Of course, if I’m talking to a broader audience, I might have to take the step back and explain what a bond is, and what exactly separates carbon from every other element. I might also, depending on the context I’m speaking about benzene, not need to reference its structure at all. If I’m describing the fact that there are many clear liquids, for instance, I can just say that benzene exists.</p>
<p>I do agree that I think a little more philosophically about my research than most of my peers, I’m realizing during this musing. Much like a child that asks “why” to each successive answer, I’m dissatisfied with ending my field at something above first principles. Of course, first principles means different things in different situations.</p>
<p>I cannot think of a way that I can meaningfully connect the Higgs-Boson to the rotational constant of a molecule, for instance. There are reasons for this.</p>
<p>One major reason is emergent properties. An emergent property is just when an ensemble of something behaves differently than you would expect from a single piece. It’s related to another concept that I can’t remember the name of but that I’m sure I remember an XKCD about. I can’t find the comic right now, for all that I remember it clearly.<a href="#fn0619" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Ok the concept is called reductionism, and it says that you can explain something by just explaining its component parts. The comic points out the ridiculousness of this approach, by separating the word “reductionism” into its component letters and their specific meanings. I don’t really like reductionism as a concept, and particularly not when looking at my molecules. They are fundamentally different than a collection of quarks, and I don’t know how much learning about quarks helps you to understand the rotations.</p>
<p>Of course, the same is true for any piece of information. On its own, it has no use. It gains value almost by existence of any other piece of information.</p>
<p>Anyways, while I don’t think that it’s useful to describe first principles in Chemistry<a href="#fn0620" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> as anything smaller than an atom. Of course, there are other orthogonal directions we can take.</p>
<p>Ensemble averages in statistical mechanics, for instance, are only really useful when you explain the quantum classical divide. Rotational spectroscopy, when I take a step back and look at it, is kind of wild. It’s inherently a statistical mechanics problem, because we’re probing millions and trillions of molecules and seeing how they respond in ensemble averages. However, the way that they respond still correlates really neatly to discrete quantum transitions. I’m sure there’s something analogous between the way that pressure broadening makes multiple lines look like one line and the way that energy levels become bands in metals.</p>
<p>Oh gosh, energy levels are something I haven’t even thought about or addressed. In general chemistry, they’re all over the place. Despite the fact that I’m doing quantized transitions, we never really use them in rotational spectroscopy.<a href="#fn0621" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> I wonder why that is.</p>
<p>A few reasons pop to mind immediately. For one, we often work with well over ten thousand energy levels. In order to represent that on a page in any meaningful way, the page would need to be massive.</p>
<p>Ope ok so returning to the essay. People today are afraid of language, which has a lot of reasons. I’m not afraid of having a distinct voice in my thesis, which I think will help, and I’m not against making it broadly understandable. I’m willing to put forth the extra energy to make it theoretically approachable.</p>
<p>Older textbooks come from a place of authors also not knowing as much, because the fields had so much less information. As a result, if they had five pages to fill on quantum mechanics, there was less information they needed to cram, which meant there was more time that could be taken to explain. Anyways, this feels like a good place to end for the night. It’s a rambly musing to be sure, but I plan to spend some time in the coming days and weeks revising some of these rambles.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write 1700 words for NaNoWriMo? I did! Just updated on the site too</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb? I did not. As mentioned, today was a busy day, which mean that I had less time and space to write. Halfway through the month, I’m more ok with the fact that I can’t write a long blog post and a chapter of Jeb a day. Right now I’m valuing the long posts more than the Jeb.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? This feels incredibly rambly, but I feel like I touched on a lot of things that I would otherwise forget and want to remember.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? I did stretch after last night, but not today.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing better at prayer than a rushed and thoughtless rosary? I spent time around Catholics and spent some time reading the book of essays, so kind of.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing a good job writing letters to friends? I really felt like I would have time for it today, but didn’t. The hours passed way too quickly. I need to get back into writing things down physically. For whatever reason, an inked page is easier for me to follow than a webpage. I keep hoping that won’t be true, but it keeps being true, and I need to learn to accept that fact.</p></li>

<li id="fn062" role="doc-endnote"><p>the fact that I treat this site as a journal is certainly an interesting change. Oh! I just remembered that one other idea I was given/ came to was reflecting on whatever I posted about five years ago today (the first year of the blog, and the most successful iteration). It’s a little strange to realize that I started this blog almost a fifth of my life ago. It feels both like far more than a fifth of my life has passed me by and like I’m exactly the same person I was then.

<li id="fn065" role="doc-endnote"><p>that phrasing felt wrong for a second. I realize it’s because I’m splitting the infinitive, which was frowned upon in early American grammatical conventions. The reason, like many, comes from the fact that everyone agrees that Latin is the best language. Since Latin has one word infinitives, you cannot split them. As a result, people thought we should not do it in English either. I hate that for a lot of reasons, not least that I like the fact that to go quickly and to quickly go have shades of different meaning.

<p>First Published: 2023 November 15</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>It’s been a while since my last book review! Looking at the site,<a href="#fn071" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I’ve reviewed seven books so far on this blog. I’ve read far more than seven, so let’s see if there’s something in particular that links the books I have reviewed.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In April of 2022, I reviewed my first book, <a href="book-review-grandmother-sorry.html">My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She’s Sorry by Fredrik Backman</a>. It was a really good book, albeit one that I haven’t thought about in ages. I remember absolutely bawling as I finished the book, and I think it’s the book that made me cry more than anything else I’ve ever read. I should really read it again, because I loved it a lot and I’m curious how much I’ll like it a second time through. A lot of the book was interesting to me because of how little I knew about it.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="book-review-faces-lewis.html">Till We Have Faces by C.S. Lewis</a> was apparently the second book I reviewed.<a href="#fn072" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> I read it as part of a book club in my parish, and I remember enjoying it a lot. I don’t think that I’ve really thought about it since I wrote the reflection, and I don’t think I’d heard of it before the book club. So, there’s no personal connection I can find without reading it.<a href="#fn073" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Next, a few months later, I reviewed <a href="book-review-atomic-habits.html">Atomic Habits by James Clear</a>. I have a similar lack of connection to the book. I enjoyed it, but I think I found it less impactful than the first book I reviewed.</p></li>
<li><p>One single day later, I reviewed <a href="book-review-gideon-ninth.html">Gideon the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir</a>. I enjoyed that book a fair amount, though I think it’s interesting that I ended my review saying that I was looking forward to the next book in the series. If I remember correctly, the second book is written, appropriately enough, in second person.<a href="#fn074" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>About a month later, I reviewed <a href="book-review-housekeeper-professor-ogawa.html">The Housekeeper and the Professor by Yoko Ogawa</a>. It was a really fantastic book, and one that I do have a long personal history with. Before my grandmother died, I remember that she gave me the book to read.<a href="#fn075" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> It is a bittersweet book, which is fitting for a lot of the memories that I have of times before my grandparents died.<a href="#fn076" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Honestly, I’m choking up a little thinking about this book, which is kind of interesting. I love it a lot, and I think that it holds up if anything better with having reread it.</p>
<p>It’s interesting to me how that can be true. I feel like normally when I read a book that I have fond memories of, the memories become tainted somehow. Even if I appreciate the book as much, I still look at my past memories of the book with a different light. With this book, however, my old memories are still there, if anything slightly better. Regardless of if I actually read it in the upstairs bedroom of my grandmother’s home or if that’s just the room I have the clearest memories of, it is a warm thought.</p></li>
<li><p>Almost seven months later,<a href="#fn077" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> I reviewed <a href="book-review-after-dragons.html">After the Dragons by Cynthia Zhang</a>. It was a book that I picked up on impulse, enjoyed, and haven’t really thought about since. In that regard, it’s similar to most of the items on this list. It was a little more literary than I tend to enjoy, I do recall clearly.<a href="#fn078" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Finally, I reviewed <a href="book-review-maus.html">Art Spiegelman’s Maus</a>./footnote<span>I don’t know why it feels so important to me to give ownership of the book to him in that way, but I do. It’s something interesting about my thought process, at least.</span> In the current world, it feels especially important for the book to be read, for all that this feels like the exact wrong time to suggest that others read it.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Well, I can’t find anything that directly links the books. There are some I had a bit of a historic connection to, some that I read for external reasons, and some that I just chose to read on my own. With that long introduction<a href="#fn079" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> out of the way, I’ve figured out what this post will be about.</p>
<p>I recently read The Creative Writer’s Survival Guide: Advice from an Unrepentant Novelist by John McNally. If I remember correctly, either my father or one of his colleagues was getting rid of a lot of his<a href="#fn0710" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> books. My father thought that my little brother and I might be interested in books on writing, and we each saved a few.</p>
<p>One of the books I saved was a book on how to do NaNoWriMo successfully, which I annotated and gave to a friend who’s doing the event with me this year.<a href="#fn0711" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> In addition to the other books, which I have yet to read, I got the aforementioned survival guide. I realized about halfway through reading that it was an ARC<a href="#fn0712" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>. I can’t imagine too much of the content changed before final publication, but who can say.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that I have no intention to make a career out of writing,<a href="#fn0713" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> it had a fair amount of advice that seems relevant to me. Most of it was given as asides to his main points, but I don’t think that makes the advice any less useful. For instance, he talked a lot about the resistance that many young authors have to being told that their writing can improve. I know that there are strains of that still within me, and I should really get rid of it. I know that I am not a great writer, for all that I think I’ll start to defend myself as a good writer these days.</p>
<p>Other relevant advice was that you need to treat writing as a commitment, and that inspiration only strikes when it’s made incredibly easy.<a href="#fn0714" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> That is, while sometimes a short story or poem comes out incredibly easily and polished from an early draft, it only comes because of a heavy grind. This is one place where music is absolutely a great analogy, for all that it’s also true for me in writing.</p>
<p>In music, if you just practice scales and tone every day for like fifteen minutes, any song you attempt after three weeks will suddenly become easier. Small composition exercises on voice leading makes writing interesting and singable lines almost second nature. Writing a sonnet a day starts out feeling impossible, but a few short weeks later, is incredibly easy.</p>
<p>Other good advice was generally remembering that everyone you interact with is a person.<a href="#fn0715" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> That is, when you talk to an editor, for example, the editor will remember you after the conversation. Even if that doesn’t directly make it easier to publish with them, it does mean they’re more likely to point you to a place you might be able to publish. If you give a reading, anyone who comes can be great or terrible publicity for your book.</p>
<p>As someone who’s steadily making a more public presence by giving talks, that’s probably worth remembering. Every time that someone leaves a talk of mine and thinks better of science or the University<a href="#fn0716" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>, I’ve done a good thing.</p>
<p>Anyways, the book as a whole gave me a lot to think about, and it has a long list of books to read on improving my craft, so I’ll probably try to read more of those in the future. I don’t know if I’ll reread this book, but if any of my readers have been considering a career in writing<a href="#fn0717" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>, I would recommend it. He did make it very clear that most writers end their careers at their best writing, which makes so much sense to me now that it’s been pointed out.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write 1700 words for NaNoWriMo? I did, and the reminder from yesterday made me post the update.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb? I finished the chapter, and it was a little easier.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? I once again rambled, but I did write a post and explore some thoughts I’m having.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? Ope. Time to stretch.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing better at prayer than a rushed and thoughtless rosary? No. I feel bad about it, but I did read<a href="#fn0718" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> a book on apologetics, which is somewhat prayerful, I suppose.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing a good job writing letters to friends? Shoot! I meant to write a letter tonight. I did not and it’s now too late for me to feel up to it. I guess I’ll do it tomorrow.</p></li>

If we think about it, first person is referring to self, second person refers to the other participant in the conversation. Third person refers to something not a part of the conversation. I know that there are languages that divide the world differently, but I don’t think linguistics needs more people. Ope. I’ve looked it up, and there are evidences of persons after third. Apparently some languages treat referring to someone nearby and somewhere far away differently. When they do, the latter is sometimes considered fourth person. There’s also a reference to fifth person, so that’s interesting. Otherwise, fourth person is sometimes used in languages that treat generic referents differently than the standard third person (e.g. one should not). That’s kind of cool, and something worth thinking about for any future ConLang I work on.)

<li id="fn078" role="doc-endnote"><p>though as mentioned yesterday, I recently read a book on being a novelist (more focused on the financial and professional consequences of the choice, rather than a style guide or anything, which meant it wasn’t particularly relevant for my life. For all that I do enjoy writing, and for all that I do intend to continue writing for the rest of my life, I don’t know if I really want to try to make it my full time career. I like it being a dedicated but amateur (in the sense of doing for love rather than money, which I think tends to be a newer distinction than I tend to use in my writing) hobby, and I worry about how little I would enjoy it if I were compensated. That’s probably an attitude I should investigate (I should read my old posts to see how often I say the word investigate, because I have a gut feeling I think that I should investigate a lot of my thoughts in the future. Unfortunately, it’s always the present). Actually, that might be a good book to review here. Anyways, the book talked about how there’s a sense in which you should, upon reading something you do not enjoy, ask yourself what is wrong with you, rather than asking what’s wrong with the text. As he points out, if you read something for a course, that means a professor (ever since I made the choice to capitalize all professions in my book and then shift it to a school arc, where there are, obviously enough, a lot of Professors, I feel the urge to capitalize the word whenever I use it), who presumably has expertise you wish to acquire, thinks that it was worth reading. Even if you were not assigned a book, the fact that it’s published (the guide was written before the age of self publishing had really gotten started) means that a lot of people, all of whom are experts in their field, thought that the book was worth publishing. It’s an interesting thought, and one that I feel is useful. I’ve realized that I have started to think of writing and words (there’s a better way to phrase that, I’m sure, but I can’t think of it) with the same part of me that thinks about music.</p>
<p>That is, I have two very distinct mindsets when I listen to music. (I think, let’s see if two is the right number or if I should’ve said N and then fixed in post). Most of the time, I treat music as an accompaniment to my life, something that I listen to because I enjoy, not trying to pick up anything in it. Other times, though, I treat music as an academic exercise, looking and listening deeply to see what makes it do what it does. When I listened to music that I did not find matched my aesthetic in undergraduate, I learned how to appreciate it for what it did well. I should really get better at doing that for literature. After all, anti intellectualism isn’t cool anymore (it was never cool). Wow that was a long diversion from the book I reviewed<a href="#fn07ref8" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn0715" role="doc-endnote"><p>having now moved past the paragraphs I discussed and come back to this footnote, I think that I explained it badly.

<li id="fn0716" role="doc-endnote"><p>hey look, a place where capitalizing was appropriate. I want to bring back the early modern English trend of capitalizing any important words in a sentence, for all that I know that there are probably good and legitimate reasons that we discontinued the practice.

Why, exactly, the definition of double space was relevant to a federal case, is still a little unclear to me, but it was a great read, as everything petty by lawyers tends to be.

<h1 id="on-writing-again"><a href="writing-7.html">On Writing Again</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 November 14</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>First, let’s address the elephant in the room. <a href="dungeons-dragons-6.html">Yesterday</a> I said I would be musing about my Pathfinder game tonight. However, schedules ended up misaligning, and so we did not have pathfinder tonight. Instead, I’m going to<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> discuss some writing advice I saw today, and what my initial reactions are to it.</p>
<p>The last time I mused about writing was apparently <a href="writing-6.html">a few months ago.</a> In that post, I talked about what was and wasn’t working for me in writing during that period of my life. Let’s see how that’s changed or stayed the same.</p>
<p>I was using an app called Stimuwrite at that point to motivate me. It was a great app, and I would still really recommend using it, especially in places with less than high speed and reliable internet. Thankfully, right now I have that constantly, so I have been using a web based app called 4thewords. It’s a really fun rpg style writing app that I may have spoken about before.</p>
<p>In case I haven’t, I was very curious how they would make the fact that you fight monsters in this game work with the fact that it’s an rpg. For those who don’t know, games in that genre tend to have different upgrades for your character as the game progresses. 4thewords has an interesting approach, where it takes fewer words typed to defeat monsters the higher your attack stat is. It’s fun for me, because it really does help the typing feel more meaningful. Instead of a dopamine hit every one hundred words, for instance, right now I’m at the point where I get it about every seventy.</p>
<p>That, combined with the fact that they have a whole story line, including a side quest series for the month of November, makes it really motivating for me to write. There are so many times that I look at the page, not wanting to write, but see the counting down of the clock and feel the words start to flow out.</p>
<p>I was struggling to write poetry then. Now I am not. Now, this is not because I suddenly got over the mental block which stopped me. No, I took the easier route and stopped wanting to write poetry. It at least aligns my actions to my goals, even if I don’t necessarily want it to.<a href="#fn082" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>I was in a good habit of writing letters to friends, which I’m trying to get back into.<a href="#fn083" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>I wasn’t journalling, which I kind of forgot was something I was trying to do. I feel like this is a place that I spend a lot of time and words journaling, though.<a href="#fn084" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>In writing that last post, I had just gotten a fountain pen. Since then, I’ve written almost exclusively with it, and it really does make the writing process feel so much better.</p>
<p>I think that one major difference is the ritual involved. I keep the pen in a small plastic/metal<a href="#fn085" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> case, and there’s something really satisfying about opening the case to pull out my pen to start writing. It’s also, as I mentioned in the first musing, heavy. The weight is really nice, because it reminds me that what I’m doing is an act of creation.</p>
<p>I think that I’m writing more again, though I don’t know if it’s all in the journals I keep. I have been doing a lot of derivations for my research, and I’ve filled pages of my notebook in dense scratching text.</p>
<p>One benefit of using a pen with replaceable cartridges is that I get to change the color. I apparently write through about one cartridge a month, which means I get to swap what I write with about once a month. It’s interesting to me how different my writing feels when I change up the ink even slightly. I almost feel like it’s the advice that is often given to guitarists: when it stops being fun to play the guitar, switch your strings. Something about the new color just makes me want to write by hand a lot more.</p>
<p>It also flows so smoothly. I didn’t realize how much I would hate using ball point pens until I stopped having to. When I use them now, it feels like I’m using a pen to write something down, rather than the pen feeling like a natural extension of my hands.</p>
<p>Anyways, one thousand words of rambling in, let’s get to the meat of the discussion. The writing advice I saw today came courtesy of a fantasy author I follow on tumblr, who shared a screencap with annotations of writing advice from Chuck Palahniuk. It’s framed as a six month process, wherein you are not allowed to write in certain ways.</p>
<p>Now, this is not a restriction like the sorts of constrained writing where you can’t use certain letters, or you need to have certain cadences or rhyme schemes. Instead, it is focused on the content of the writing, and making a point to show not tell. It’s filled with examples of how the process works, so I will do my best to synthesize the content here.<a href="#fn086" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>First, no “thought” verbs are allowed. That is, we are not allowed to say how a character feels.</p>
<p>Rather than “Jim wondered whether Jill was mad at him,” I instead would have to describe the scene. “Jim had grown accustomed to Jill’s bright wave every morning when they crossed paths. Lately, though, she had given half hearted waves, if she bothered to acknowledge him at all.”</p>
<p>I still don’t know if I did that correctly. The author specifically says the goal is to show the reader through sensory cues exactly what the characters are feeling. Characters cannot want or feel something, I must make the readers want or feel.<a href="#fn087" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>The author of the advice points out that many authors hamstring themselves by writing a paragraph that begins with how the character is feeling, killing the energy of the rest of the paragraph.</p>
<p>That is, a forbidden text might read something like:</p>
<p>Alex knew that he would be late to work today. Five busses had passed him by without stopping, and another five just hadn’t shown up. Taxis seemed in shockingly short supply, and the wind precluded his running in any direction.</p>
<p>When rectified, the paragraph could begin Alex was late to work that day.<a href="#fn088" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Or, at the very least, the think can be moved to the end of the paragraph.<a href="#fn089" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>One particular piece of advice he gives is to minimize time that characters are alone. Especially given the sort of writing that I’m prone to, that seems infeasible. I really like the fact that my book has a deep exploration of a single person studying, for all that I can see, reading his advice and looking at my writing, exactly why my writing has been described as so impersonal.</p>
<p>Forgetting and remembering are also considered no nos, but he used it in the context of like remembering childhood. Most of the time that I use remember, it is to spark something from a conversation that happened on screen a few chapters earlier.<a href="#fn0810" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>He also rails against the verb to be, pointing out that most of the time, it’s unneeded. Rather than saying “Phillip had red hair,” I could do something more like “Phillip grinned and ran a finger through his scarlet locks.” The homework is to go through my writing and get rid of any instance of thought words, then do the same to a published text. I don’t know if I’ll actually do that this month, especially since it seems better used for an editing/revising phase of writing, at least at first.<a href="#fn0811" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Still, it is probably worthwhile to at least try drafting a chapter normally and then going through and seeing how differently it reads when following this advice. I’m beginning to understand why some people treat learning the craft of fiction like they and others treat learning music theory.</p>
<p>For those who may not know, there’s a common trend among amateur musicians<a href="#fn0812" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> where they believe that learning too much about the craft will lessen their creative potential, making their writing like everyone else’s. As a musician, every time I hear that take, my response is either:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>by everyone else’s you mean the people whose music you admire, listen to, and enjoy?</p></li>
<li><p>No, learning the rules explicitly keeps you from following them completely by rote because all you know is C, D, G on a guitar, which is following such basic rules that it’s incredibly limiting to anything you could want to write</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, most of the time those responses are in my head.</p>
<p>As a former student of music<a href="#fn0813" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>, I will admit that those people have a point. During my first semester of learning theory explicitly in particular, my writing became much more stilted, following the conventions as I was taught them badly.<a href="#fn0814" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> After that initial growth period, though, I can see where my music really becomes my own.</p>
<p>It does bring an interesting issue, where you have to weight the audiences of trained and unskilled. Let me try describing that better, using an analogy.<a href="#fn0815" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>My first semester sophomore year, I took a composition class. In that class, we were tasked with a number of compositional exercises which culminated in our final project: an original composition that we played live in front of the class and whoever came to watch.<a href="#fn0816" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> Of course, writing a solo piece is incredibly difficult, because a single instrument playing tends to be boring unless it is being played by an expert.<a href="#fn0817" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> As a result, almost all<a href="#fn0818" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> of us chose to write a piece for an ensemble, which we were responsible for assembling.</p>
<p>My ensemble was two clarinets, a piano,<a href="#fn0819" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> and an oboe, and many of the other members of the class also wrote for strange voicings, based on what friends we had available. One early draft of my piece had a series of chained 2-1 suspensions<a href="#fn0820" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> between, if my memory serves<a href="#fn0821" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> the two clarinets. It was an intentional choice, because I really liked the way that they sounded.</p>
<p>My professor advised me that I should get rid of them. He said something about them being a mark of someone who doesn’t know how to compose. At the time, I, like every other young creative,<a href="#fn0822" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> bristled at this intrusion onto my creative vision. However, I did really trust the professor and his advice, so I changed it to a series of 3-2 suspensions. The entire piece clicked much better once I did, and it was a choice I’m really glad was made for me. Also, now when I write I have a much better intuitive feeling for suspensions and the ways that our ears, living in the western canon as we all do, are trained.<a href="#fn0823" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Ok wait, no that’s not a good example of how experts and non experts have different taste. Shoot. It does help illustrate the way that learning helps you to create the vision of what you want, though. When I took the step back, I realized that my goal was not to create 2-1 suspensions. That is, my goal was not any individual part of the creative process. My goal was producing something beautiful at the end. By learning what the typical standards of beauty were, I was able to channel my creative impulse more effectively.</p>
<p>I guess a better example of what I mean by expert and non expert ears is a lot of contemporary classical music.<a href="#fn0824" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> Or, if not that, then at least like twelve tone serialism from the early twentieth century.<a href="#fn0825" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> Those who know what they’re listening to<a href="#fn0826" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> get to see interesting and beautiful theory worked out on a page. To the untrained ear, however, it just sounds like noise.</p>
<p>Of course, anyone writing music is aware<a href="#fn0827" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> of the audience they’re writing to. Or, rather, they should be. I certainly write differently for myself on guitar, my band, choir, and other ensembles. I had to learn how to do that, though, which is another point for formal learning: it gives you access to different registers.<a href="#fn0828" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>What I mean to say is that I don’t plan on writing literary fiction.<a href="#fn0829" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> As a result, if getting rid of words like think and hope makes my writing read less like the fiction I want to write, I will probably stop doing it quickly.</p>
<p>Then again, as I’ve mentioned, I only know how to write music in different registers because I’ve tried and failed to write the same register for incompatible uses.<a href="#fn0830" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> I suppose that until I know what it means to write at different levels, my writing will always have that same issue.<a href="#fn0831" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> So, in conclusion, I like the advice, for all that I don’t know if it will be like classical counterpoint for me<a href="#fn0832" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> or if it will be like learning melodic motion<a href="#fn0833" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a>. In either case, it will be helpful for me as I grow as a writer.</p>
<p>Ok, I said that this would be a two draft musing, but then I wrote continuously for twoish hours. It’s now bed time.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write 1700 words for NaNoWriMo? I did! Keeping on schedule, which is nice. I also remembered to log that I wrote, which is annoying to remember to backdate.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb? I wrote half a chapter. It was a bit of a slog, but I hope that tomorrow is easier.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? I rambled for almost four thousand words, at the very least.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? Oh gosh that’s something I’ve fallen right out of the habit of. It’s hard to know what’s a thing you do to recover from illness faster and what prolongs feeling bad. Stretching is probably the former.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing better at prayer than a rushed and thoughtless rosary? Eh. Honestly not really, but I don’t know how much of that is not making time, and how much of it is that my mind is not in a good space right now. I do know that I pray better when I’m doing better, which is kind of annoying.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing a good job writing letters to friends? I posted the letter that I wrote yesterday, so that’s a good enough job for right now I think.</p></li>

<li id="fn082" role="doc-endnote"><p>I forget if I’ve said on here, but I think that next month, instead of writing a novel, I might consider doing daily poetry attempts again. I’ve set aside so much time for writing that it will hopefully be enough of a habit that I can continue. Then again, I’ve recently started thinking about an idea for a series of stories or books that I’d like to write, but I’m unsure how workable the idea is. The series would be Modern Myths, and I’ll probably muse about it another time.<a href="#fn08ref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn083" role="doc-endnote"><p>it’s shockingly hard to remember what to put in letters. I feel like this summer I had a pattern down and knew what to write, but that doesn’t feel true anymore for some reason. Probably worth interrogating myself as to why that is (not that I don’t already have ideas or anything)<a href="#fn08ref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn084" role="doc-endnote"><p>neither of the two (different) spellings was accepted by the spell checker, so I have no idea what it should be.

<li id="fn085" role="doc-endnote"><p>it feels too cheap and flimsy to be metal but moves too easily to be plastic<a href="#fn08ref5" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn086" role="doc-endnote"><p>if you can’t tell, one of the main purposes of this blog is to give me a space to write through how I feel about something. I type far faster than I write (maybe I should learn shorthand to rectify that), so this works better for me by far than trying to journal. Also, when I journal, I feel an urge to at least nominally work on my penmanship, which is a bit of an issue because I write even slower.<a href="#fn08ref6" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn087" role="doc-endnote"><p>which is strange, and not something I necessarily think translates to all my writing particularly well. I absolutely think that as an exercise it’s worth doing, if only because I can see how prescriptive my writing style is. I worry that I’ll go to far with it, though, ending up with purple prose. As one person I saw commented on a similar sentiment, not every sentence can be profound and breathtaking. Sometimes the character just needs to be on the other side of the room.<a href="#fn08ref7" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn088" role="doc-endnote"><p>i guess I see where getting rid of think could help, it does read more snappily<a href="#fn08ref8" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn089" role="doc-endnote"><p>which also does a lot to help. Maybe there’s something to this published and well renowned author’s advice<a href="#fn08ref9" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0810" role="doc-endnote"><p>now, is that itself good writing practice? maybe not. I feel like a lot of advice is not written presuming serialized formats though. By nature of the staggered releases, it is almost certain that the audience will not remember as well as if they had the entire book in front of them when they began to read<a href="#fn08ref10" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0811" role="doc-endnote"><p>as a friend put it, otherwise they’d spend too much time editing while they write, which is against the core ethos of NaNoWriMo<a href="#fn08ref11" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0812" role="doc-endnote"><p>and, as I’ve recently learned, amateur writers<a href="#fn08ref12" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn0814" role="doc-endnote"><p>that is, I was bad at following the conventions. I was taught the conventions wonderfully and excellently<a href="#fn08ref14" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0815" role="doc-endnote"><p>which just for this, I’ll try to use the writing advice I’m nominally still reflecting on<a href="#fn08ref15" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0816" role="doc-endnote"><p>our professor advertised, and I went to a small enough school that people actually went to their friend’s class presentations, which doesn’t really seem to happen where I am now. It’s also possible I’m just out of the loop here, or that it didn’t happen as much as I thought where I went to school. Who can say for certain?<a href="#fn08ref16" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0817" role="doc-endnote"><p>now, we can get to the whole “wow that’s incredibly elitist and western music centric of you, look at (insert any other solo tradition here) or think about all the singer songwriters out there.” That is a valid critique, and it is a sticking point for a lot of theorists that western music analysis more or less ignores words. I’m now realizing that might be part of why so many people make such a big deal of madrigalisms (a lot of the madrigals (a style of polyphonic music) that still exist are sacred. There are some conventions in writing for them, such as having either a unison or triad on the word G-d and Trinity (respectively for the first level and counterespectively for the spicy “look who understands theology” version) and rising on words like rise, falling on words like down), since they’re really the only genre in western canon that has that (as with anything in music, exceptions apply) universally applicable) As a result, artists like Woody Guthrie or Bob Dylan, though they uncontroversially write beautiful and wonderful music, are less interesting to study from a music perspective, as they intentionally rely on the stock nature of their arrangements and compositions to allow their words to shine through. (Wow this is a lot of words, maybe worth not being a footnote, but too late)<a href="#fn08ref17" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0818" role="doc-endnote"><p>i think all of us, but I might be wrong (footnotes don’t count, because they’re not part of the narrative, so I don’t have to write correctly according to the style)<a href="#fn08ref18" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0819" role="doc-endnote"><p>I forgot about this at first, and then remembered<a href="#fn08ref19" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0820" role="doc-endnote"><p>for the non music nerds, a second is when you have the two notes next to each other, and suspensions are when you have a dissonance because one voice holds while the other moves. In this case, they move to a second, then resolve to a unison, move to a second, on and on<a href="#fn08ref20" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0821" role="doc-endnote"><p>see, that’s the thing about this style guide. Sometimes I do not know what I’m trying to remember, and the effort is worth mentioning. Maybe there’s a way to make it work, I should consider that as I think about this advice<a href="#fn08ref21" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0822" role="doc-endnote"><p>I feel comfortable saying this, since I read a book that said it’s common for writing teachers<a href="#fn08ref22" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0823" role="doc-endnote"><p>there are a lot of arguments about how much of what we think about music is innate and how much is learned. It’s really hard to test these days, as basically every population we can interact with has been exposed to tons of western music, through the radio if nothing else. Global hegemony has its downsides, and anthropologists are the ones to suffer. That being said, it is uncontroversial to say that in general minor chords are sad and major chords are happy. Whether this is because of something innate or learned does not matter, because it will work on your audiences. (That’s another way that learning is good. I now know that when I want to showcase a sadder part of a text, I want to rely more on minor chords and motions to subdominant keys rather than dominant keys)<a href="#fn08ref23" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn0825" role="doc-endnote"><p>to be fair, that is where most music theory classes stop. After that, there’s not a lot of canon, for all that there is absolutely development happening. There’s a lot to explore in the ways that mass production and dissemination of musical recordings changed the concept of musical eras, even before we get to the fractured space of modern music, where there’s a lot of talk about there being no real cultural zeitgeist.<a href="#fn08ref25" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn0829" role="doc-endnote"><p>which I hate as a concept, much like I hate academic music as a concept, for all that I respect it more. I’m positive that if I ever took courses on literary fiction that I would feel much better about it, because it is absolutely the anti intellectualism speaking when I say I don’t like high brow stuff. Of course, there’s also explicit elitism in creating that’s probably worth analyzing. Certainly all the early pioneers into really weird music that I read about hoped that audiences would learn to like it, while it feels like a lot of writers disdain the common listener. Who knows?

That’s probably bad. I think it involves like verb splitting (to boldy go) but don’t know that for certain) in the middle of like an action scene where the goal is fast paced words. I did also see something about how sentence length can be used to control a reader’s reading. That’s absolutely something I should get better at.

<h1 id="dungeons-and-dragons-again"><a href="dungeons-dragons-6.html">Dungeons and Dragons Again</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 November 13</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As I mentioned last week, I’ve started a new dungeons and dragons campaign. I found out after this first session that we’re supposed to be in a like turn of the first century time period, which makes my decision to play a plasmid somewhat of a choice. The session started as most first sessions do, we all were introduced to each other in a tavern.</p>
<p>My character immediately drew a lot of attention, because I finally decided on a shape and build. I was a vaguely humanish shaped blob, and my skin was shaded in reds blacks and browns, as though a lava flow. As a result, while I was known to Giants as Goob<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, I was known to most of the smaller races as Ember.</p>
<p>We met a small girl named Margaret, who was a Paladin on a quest currently to destroy the pirates who had kidnapped her. The first combat went smoothly, and Goob easily withstood all of the damage that it had drawn, keeping the rest of the party safe. It also managed to free a Tiefling from her captivity, and was pretty sure that she watched and followed the party as they continued on to find the rest of the pirates.</p>
<p>As we marched, the party found an arrow at our feet with a message in Elvish. Thankfully, Margaret knew Elvish, and was able to translate. The note said that we had allies.</p>
<p>Some members of the party were less than thrilled with this turn of events, feeling as though it was a bad idea to trust people we could not see. The rest of us, Goob obviously included, felt like we were in no position to turn down help, and it wasn’t as though they’d really offered us a choice. We were ambushed by six pirates, who our unseen allies quickly dispatched. With them gone, we looted their corpses.<a href="#fn092" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Adventuring a little further, we came to a staircase which descended to 25 or so pirates. Goob had some fantastic attacks, dealing well over forty damage on multiple turns.<a href="#fn093" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Because Goob played his role as tank admirably, most of the party took minimal damage.</p>
<p>Margaret, of course, being young and known to the pirates, also drew a fair amount of fire. Goob, seeing this, rushed to draw the aggression of the other patrols. In a few almost sickeningly powerful blows, he dispatched almost the entire patrol in front of them. Unfortunately, the surviving members of each patrol focused their fire onto Goob, and it died.<a href="#fn094" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>This was, as I learned afterwards, the GM’s first ever player character death. He felt terrible about it, which I feel bad about. I was not super attached to this character, for all that I think it was fun.</p>
<p>I did really enjoy trying to get into the mind of an alien who had been raised by giants trying to interact with humans and astral elves. I roleplayed the fact that, having an amorphous body, I was not going to be constrained to typical biology.<a href="#fn095" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Among other things, this meant that I tried to copy the gait of members of the party, and that I had two eyes<a href="#fn096" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> which rotated about my head, one traveling clockwise and the other counterclockwise.<a href="#fn097" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>I also often forgot that people could not just move their head or body in directions, doing so. In character, at least, the party was sad to see me die. Out of character, I think that they’re mostly just excited to see what character I bring next week.</p>
<p>One thing I realized when I rolled my first critical of the night was just how much I love rolling large numbers of dice. For all that I don’t have a ton of time in the next few days,<a href="#fn098" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> I might spend a bit of time finding the way to build a character that gets to roll a lot of dice.</p>
<p>Immediate ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Monks apparently get large numbers of attacks</p></li>
<li><p>Rogues get sneak attack, which is a fun lil 2d6 right now<a href="#fn099" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I think I heard half orcs crit on 19, which doubles my odds of getting double dice</p></li>
<li><p>I have to imagine that there are more feats than just the giant foundling one that give you an extra die while attacking, even if it is limited in how many times you can use it</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not a great list, I’ll fully admit, but it at least is a place to start looking. Barbarian does have the benefit of the Zealot subclass, which gets an extra d6 on the first attack of each turn while raging. That was a lot of fun tonight, especially on the one critical I had.<a href="#fn0910" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>I guess one thing is that rolling 2d6 is better than 1d12, even though the damage output is slightly lower, so I should look for melee weapons that have more than one hit die as well. Also, because it’s already late<a href="#fn0911" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>, I’m not going to revise today’s post. That’s a shame, because it does limit the word count for today, but such is the way of life.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write 1700 words for NaNoWriMo? I did! I actually wrote a bit of a fight scene that I’m almost proud of, which is really nice.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb? I finished the chapter that I’ve been allegedly working on for a few days. I also spent some time plotting out what I’d like to start happening in the next few chapters.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? Look at this beautiful blog post wow!</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? No, and I forgot to yesterday as well. I’m starting to feel stiffer, though that might also just be the recovery from illness.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing better at prayer than a rushed and thoughtless rosary? I don’t think last night’s rosary was rushed, and I did remember to take some time to pray the Angelus at around noon. That being said, tonight’s rosary will likely be rushed.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing a good job writing letters to friends? I wrote a letter! There was a bit of downtime in my day, and I filled it by writing a letter. Now I just need to post it, but I can do that tomorrow<a href="#fn0912" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>

<li id="fn092" role="doc-endnote"><p>My character was neutral evil, which I took to mean was very willing to spill blood if it meant that my character was compensated for the time. Since Margaret, being twelve, did not have coin to offer, my character took on itself the choice to loot the people we killed instead.<a href="#fn09ref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn093" role="doc-endnote"><p>wow a zealot barbarian with the Fire Giant Fist Feat is a fun thing to play.
