<p>First Published: 2022 July 4</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today I went to a crafting event with some friends. I knew that I needed a project, but wasn’t sure what to work on. Recently I’ve realized how limiting the way I know how to crochet is.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, most of what I crochet is meant to be warm and thick, so the fabric being so is a plus. But, as these summer months go on, I’m beginning to understand the appeal of looser fabrics. So, I decided to look for an easy project that would force me to use a new stitch.</p>
<p>Enter the Solomon Knot.<a href="#fn001" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Though I cannot find a reason for the name, it’s functionally just a very loose set of single crochets with skips. It took me a bit to get into the flow of the stitch,<a href="#fn002" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, but now that I have I really enjoy it.</p>
<p>I like how I can decide exactly how large the holes are, though that really adds another level to keeping consistency in my stitch. In the Solomon Stitch, you not only have to keep string tension the same, but also keep the loops you make the same size. I’m making a bag out of this stitch, which I likely won’t want or keep, but I’ve been surprised by myself before.</p>
<p>I’ve really forgotten how much I love crocheting, so it was great to spend time with friends and learn the knot.</p>

<h1 id="reflections-on-todays-gospel"><a href="reflections-on-readings-14-ordinary-c-22.html">Reflections on Today’s Gospel</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 July 3</p>
<p>Luke 10:20 “Nevertheless, do not rejoice because the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice because your names are written in heaven.”</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today is the 14th Sunday of Ordinary Time. Since I stopped these reflections in the Easter season, it’s kind of strange not having a season I can orient my reflections on.</p>
<p>The last line of the Gospel today is really striking to me. Christ commands his followers to go to the neighboring towns to share the good news.<a href="#fn011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> They return rejoicing, because they have power over demons now. Christ reorients their joy.</p>
<p>Rather than focusing on the temporal benefits of faith, He reminds us that everything is good only in how it leads us to Heaven. That’s something I need to remind myself more about. A rich prayer life is only worth celebrating in how it orients my will to the Lord’s. Struggles are only damaging in how they damage my trust in Him.</p>
<p>I’m sure there’s a deeper level to today’s readings, but this is all that I have right now.</p>

<h1 id="lemon-wine"><a href="lemon-wine.html">Lemon Wine</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 July 1</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Yesterday I went through the past two months of my life, reflecting a little on what I did. One thing I did which I’m very happy about is that I made my yearly recipe of lemon wine.</p>
<p>Lemon wine is a recipe I have adapted<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> from <a href="skeeterpee.com">here</a>. It’s functionally just lemonade that you add yeast to, but I really enjoy it, and it seems like my peers did as well.</p>
<p>Briefly, I cooked boiled 8 pounds of sugar in water with a heavy splash of lemon juice to hopefully break the dimerized sugar into monomers. From there, I combined it with two quarts of lemon juice with yeast nutrient and water to make 5ish gallons, and added EC-81 yeast. I then measured its density and aerated it 1-2 times a day for the next four days, until the density readings showed it was approximately halfway through fermentation. At that point I added another quart of lemon juice and sealed the container</p>
<p>I then left it alone for 10ish days, at which point it was finished fermenting. I then transferred it off the lees<a href="#fn022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> and let it sit for about a month. At that point I backsweetened it and bottled it up.</p>
<p>It’s always really fun to share with friends because homemade goods feel better to share than storebought, at least for me.</p>

<h1 id="monthly-reflection"><a href="reflection-june-2022.html">Monthly Reflection</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 June 30</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>So... I took a while off from blogging. I could make a lot of excuses, like that it was the end of the semester. If I look at my daily reflections, it somewhat supports that.</p>
<p>Anyways, life updates.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I finished the semester</p></li>
<li><p>I presented at a conference</p></li>
<li><p>I<a href="#fn031" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> passed my second year exam</p></li>
<li><p>I played at an open mic with a friend</p></li>
<li><p>i think that’s it</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So, looking at my goals for May, and thinking about that into June:</p>
<p>In May:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Blog daily. I still like how it forces me to think about something every day.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a poem a day. I need to do this more and I will try.<a href="#fn032" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Stretch daily. I like how stretching makes me feel, and maybe I’ll be able to touch my toes at the end of the month.</p></li>
<li><p>Listen to BiaY 7 times a week. This feels more aware of my tendency to listen to three or four in a row.</p></li>
<li><p>Finish a draft of the book I’m writing.<a href="#fn033" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> This may be optimistic, but in theory these past two weeks suggest I can do it.</p></li>
<li><p>Practice guitar every day. I’ve been getting better and I really like it.</p></li>
<li><p>In professional news: finish a reasonable draft of my exam. I need to write this, and soon</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Um</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Did not do, gave up one week in.</p></li>
<li><p>...I completely even forgot that was a goal</p></li>
<li><p>I stretched most days, though I’ve recently gotten back out of the habit</p></li>
<li><p>I think I listened 7 times since then</p></li>
<li><p>I apparently kept writing off and on until the 23 of May, getting up to 74382 words, which is still progress</p></li>
<li><p>I practiced most days</p></li>
<li><p>I just presented my exam, so I guess that counts as reasonable</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Now that I don’t have that existential dread over my head,<a href="#fn034" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> I think I’d like to get back into writing. July is apparently Camp NaNoWriMo, so I would really like to try writing here and a short story every day. I’ve already written a few<a href="#fn035" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> of them and I really enjoy the fact that it’s done when I finish writing. I’d like to get back to the LitRPG I was writing, but it’s beginning to feel like an albatross. That transitions nicely into my goals for July:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Blog daily. I kind of completely have no idea what happened in May or June because I have minimal records from them. I don’t like that</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch daily. I liked how I was starting to get more flexible</p></li>
<li><p>Be able to run a 5k. I tried one at reunion, and did not do well</p></li>
<li><p>Listen to BiaY more. I would like to finish at some point, but it’s hard to motivate</p></li>
<li><p>Practice guitar every day. I still like the incremental improvements, and I think I’d like to start shifting more up the fretboard</p></li>
<li><p>Practice accordion at least 2x a week. I just got this and I don’t want it to feel neglected<a href="#fn036" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Write a short story every day. I want to force myself to do more creative writing, especially in short contexts</p></li>
<li><p>Maybe finish the book?</p></li>
<li><p>Finish either of the two songs I’m writing. I started working on a choral setting of Stabat Mater Dolorosa, and I finally put some words and a melody to a chord loop I really like. It would be nice to finish a project</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Ok so having looked at what I thought my updates were, I think there are more. To check, I’m looking at my daily notes for the past two months in far more detail than I did to see why I stopped blogging. Since I stopped blogging I have:<a href="#fn037" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn038" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Seen a lunar eclipse.<a href="#fn039" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Started jamming with a fellow chem grad student</p></li>
<li><p>I think started working out with a fellow groupmate<a href="#fn0310" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Tried recording mental state of the day with my daily reflection.</p></li>
<li><p>Bought a guitar</p></li>
<li><p>Played at an open mic</p></li>
<li><p>Saw my sibling at their institution of higher learning to celebrate a major life milestone</p></li>
<li><p>Joined a new bible study</p></li>
<li><p>Made lemon wine</p></li>
<li><p>Bought new clothes</p></li>
<li><p>Went on group retreat</p></li>
<li><p>Went to a reunion and reconnected with a lot of lovely people</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ran a 5k</p></li>
<li><p>Saw my family</p></li>
<li><p>Got positive reviews of the lemon wine</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Went to a conference</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Met many of my collaborators</p></li>
<li><p>Made new friends</p></li>
<li><p>Tried new food</p></li>
<li><p>Gave a presentation</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Wow that really looks like a lot when I write it all out. Anyways, sorry for rambling, but also not really. I’m excited for the next month of 31 days of writing.</p>

<h1 id="writers-block"><a href="writers-block-4.html">Writer’s Block</a></h1>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>It’s really interesting where I do and don’t get writer’s block. In the exams I need to write for my program, I get them constantly. In the novel I’m writing for fun but also have committed to in some respects, I get it occasionally. In this blog, which I’ve done for longer, I get it often. And, in the random short story prompt I was given and inspired to create a tumblr for, I apparently don’t have it. Weird.</p>
<p>Anyways, writer’s block is such a weird concept when you stop to think about it. There are infinite ways that I can combine letters to create meaning, and infinitely many ways to make nonsense. But, when I have writer’s block, I can’t even think of a way to write nonsense. It’s really fun to think about.</p>
<p>That also, as I read it, may be a good solution to writer’s block. Just keyboard mash until you see a word and hope it sparks something. If I get this again, I may try it.</p>

<h1 id="writing-through-poetry-forms"><a href="poetry-forms-5.html">Writing through Poetry Forms</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 May 4</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>I think I may have written a few poems in the intervening days, but more importantly, I was able to compose a double acrostic in my head on the walk to work today. I’ll call that good enough to move on to the next form. According to <a href="poetry-forms-1.html">my list</a> of poems, the final acrostic to work through is the compound acrostic.</p>
<p>I’ve been struggling with this one primarily because I want there to be a nice symmetry between the two words, and so few words that bookend well share the same letters. Come and go, for instance, works not at all. Fight and flight, here and there, see and hear, and so on. I guess I came up with one just now, though, so we’ll see how it goes.</p>
<p>Wave and Moon<br />
What starry skies in nighttime skies ne’er claiM<br />
And daytime’s star can never dO.<br />
Vast though the ocean in its turning to and frO<br />
Each day is pulled to her when she comes agaiN<br />
Well, not the strongest poem ever. I think one thing I really struggle with in the ending portion of each line is that I really like rhyme, so the ending letters mess me up. I already have corrections actually, I’m going to make them.</p>
<p>Wave and Moon<br />
What starry skies in nighttime never claiM<br />
A force which calls, rememb’ring long agO.<br />
Vast though the distance ’tween the two<br />
Each day they pull to join agaiN<br />
I don’t know if this one is any better, but the flow is at least slightly better between lines.</p>

<h1 id="griping-about-isbn"><a href="isbn-gripe.html">Griping about ISBN</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 May 4</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As I’ve mentioned now too many times, I’m currently writing a book. I have a variety of ideas for what to do with it once I finish writing the words, but nearly all of them involve some level of self-publishing.<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I learned that if you self-publish through the largest E-book distributor, the ISBN you get is associated with them. That makes sense when I think about it for even an instant, but I’ve also learned that many independent bookstores will refuse to stock books with that publisher, for again, obvious reasons.</p>
<p>I also found out that the owner of an ISBN gains some controls over the book, which made me want to assign my own ISBN. Of course, since we live in America, the company responsible for managing the numbers also sets the pricing scheme.</p>
<p>It is the most asinine pricing scheme I have ever encountered.</p>
<p>A single ISBN costs $125. Knowing nothing about ISBN, that could be a totally valid price. 10 costs $295, or less than a quarter the cost per ISBN of buying individually. 100 costs $575, which is less than a fifth the cost per book of 10, and less than 5% the cost per individual ISBN. That’s so ridiculous that if you need 13 ISBN, it is cheaper to buy 100 than any other method. Finally, 1000 ISBN costs $1500.</p>
<p>For reference, that is 1.2% the cost per ISBN of buying individually, about 5% the cost per 10, and only slightly over 25% of the per hundred. When people say that it’s hard to be an independent business, they never mention this, though they really should. At 211 ISBN, it is now cheaper to buy 1000. That’s completely ridiculous. It’s a way of penalizing small creators and forcing them to go to larger publishing houses.</p>
<p>Anyways, that was a bit of a rant, I have no solutions, and I’m just generally annoyed by that fact. Oh! Any edition of a book needs a new ISBN<a href="#fn062" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, so unless you’re planning on only ever releasing a single book in two editions<a href="#fn063" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, there is literally no reason at all to buy ISBN one at a time. The option to do that is there, as far as I can tell, entirely to screw over new authors who aren’t sure what they’re doing.</p>
<p>The same company sells barcodes for $25. For reference, a barcode can be made online with any number of free tools in a matter of minutes. For a single QR code, they charge $75, which is even worse to me, since I doubt they take care of the hosting for the QR.</p>

<h1 id="monthly-reflection"><a href="reflection-april-22.html">Monthly Reflection</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 May 2</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Another month, another reflection. My goals for April were:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Blog daily (starting now). I think that the reflection it makes me do is really useful. I do think that I need to find a better way to ensure that I have time for it, though.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a poem a day. I just bought a book of poetic forms, so it would be good to start working through them.<a href="#fn071" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Stretch daily. I tried to stretch this morning and was shocked at how inflexible I am.</p></li>
<li><p>Listen to BiaY daily. I really don’t like how far behind I am, and I’d like to catch up sooner than later.</p></li>
<li><p>Reach 60K words in the book. If past months are indicative, that’s a goal I can accomplish. I think I may need to do some more planning, rather than writing by the seat of my pants, because I’m starting to get into a bit of a rut in terms of writing. Maybe it’s just that I have continued this section of the book for far too long.<a href="#fn072" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>A secondary goal for the book is to write every day, even if only a few words. I think it’s good to develop good habits, though I guess I should think about balancing doing something because I enjoy it with getting work done. That’s another thing to think about I suppose.</p></li>
<li><p>Practice guitar every day. I like the sound of guitar, and I would love to be able to play longer without my fingers hurting.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I blogged mostly daily. I wrote few poems. I stretched almost every day, which was really nice. It’s a great way for me to start the day, and I like how I feel when I stretch in the morning. I did not listen to BiaY daily, and I think I’m further behind again. I did reach 60K words! As of April 30 I was at 62540 words, which is pretty cool. I wrote most days, though it’s beginning to look like I need a day off, so I don’t write on Sundays.<a href="#fn073" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>My goals for May are mostly the same. It’s here that I run into the issue of goals, though. If they’re meant to be aspirational, then many of them are set too low. If they’re meant to be realistic, then I should really accept that I don’t write poetry every day. I don’t know if I can agree to either premise so I’ll shoot a little higher and be ok with failure.</p>
<p>In May:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Blog daily. I still like how it forces me to think about something every day.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a poem a day. I need to do this more and I will try.<a href="#fn074" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Stretch daily. I like how stretching makes me feel, and maybe I’ll be able to touch my toes at the end of the month.</p></li>
<li><p>Listen to BiaY 7 times a week. This feels more aware of my tendency to listen to three or four in a row.</p></li>
<li><p>Finish a draft of the book I’m writing.<a href="#fn075" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> This may be optimistic, but in theory these past two weeks suggest I can do it.</p></li>
<li><p>Practice guitar every day. I’ve been getting better and I really like it.</p></li>

<p>John 21:19 “He said to him the third time, ‘Simon, son of John, do you love me?’ Peter was distressed that he had said to him a third time, ‘Do you love me?’ and he said to him, ‘Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you.’ Jesus said to him, ‘Feed my sheep.’”</p>

<p>On this Third Sunday in Easter, we continue to see the disciples in the aftermath of the Lord’s resurrection. I find it interesting how the different readings coincide. The first speaks of the disciples preaching the Glory of our Lord on earth, the Church Militant, some might say. The second has John seeing the Church Triumphant glorifying Him. The Gospel does not directly speak on the Church Penitent, but it does show Peter’s penance.</p>
<p>Three times Peter denied the Lord, so three times he was asked to affirm his love. The fishing scene feels interesting to me as well. In the beginning of His ministry on earth, he gathers many of the disciples by finding them as they search for fish. Here, they do not recognize the voice of the Almighty when he tells them to cast out.</p>
<p>Anyways, my reflection today is short and somewhat disjointed. I apologize that my postings are becoming more and more consistently like that.</p>

<p>Well, it’s the end of the month, and I don’t quite know what to talk about. Tomorrow and Monday I can write about the readings and my reflections on this past month, but today has no such stipulation. I was just playing guitar, so it seems reasonable to talk about that.</p>
<p>I’ve been playing guitar off and on for most of my life. I don’t know how old I was when I first started lessons, but I do remember that they were primarily focused on simple chords and strumming patterns. I think that’s called rhythm guitar by people in the know.</p>
<p>As I grew older, I eventually started studying music. That happened to coincide with my breaks from guitar, which is a little sad. It’s made coming back to guitar really interesting every time I do, though.</p>
<p>Guitar, moreso than any other instrument I’ve seen, has learning materials which seem actively opposed to conventional music theory. They don’t use sheet music and barely use rhythm. On the other hand, classical guitar has less of this issue.<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I just can’t find any music easy enough to play that is interesting enough to keep me playing.</p>
<p>So, I decided that, as the adult I am now, I should really work on mostly doing exercises for my practice time. For a while the skill I felt I lacked most was my right hand plucking, so I started working on Mauro Guiliani’s right hand patterns. It’s 120 exercises that have you playing between a CM and a G7<a href="#fn092" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> chord in your left hand while your right plucks out different patterns. That’s worked well for me, and I’ve enjoyed it.</p>
<p>These past few weeks, though, I’ve been saddened by my inability to play more melodic things on a guitar. Partially that’s because I don’t plan on doing a lot of solo guitar, but partially I just never really built the skills for moving my left hand on the guitar. As it turns out, Guiliani wrote some exercises for the right hand as well. I’ve been working through the first bit of the first one for a week or so now, and it’s weird.</p>
<p>I never realized how uncomfortable I was using my second and fourth fingers at once.<a href="#fn093" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> The exercise has me doing a lot of that, which is really nice. Primarily it just goes up and down the strings using the first through fifth frets playing thirds on adjacent strings. It’s not the most fun, but it is pretty cool to be able to do it with more ease. As I look at the other exercises, it appears as though the next has me playing 6ths, the next octaves, the fourth is tenths which is wild to me, the fifth is thirds again for some reason, my minimal Italian suggesting that it helps with moving up the fretboard, the sixth again has me doing sixths<a href="#fn094" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>, the seventh octaves, the eighth tenths, and repeating until we’ve gotten through sixteen exercises. They each look to be about 20-24 measures of common time with moving sixteenth notes, so as you can imagine I am not going through it quickly. I think the furthest I’ve gotten is six measures through the first, but that’s progress still!</p>
