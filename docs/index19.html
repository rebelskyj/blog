<h1 id="writers-block"><a href="writers-block-5.tex">Writer‚Äôs Block</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 November 3</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>First, apparently I never published my <a href="writers-block-4.html">last writer‚Äôs block post</a>, and instead linked to an older one. Wild.</p>
<p>Anyways, for whatever reason, I can‚Äôt think of what to blog about today. I‚Äôve written over 2000 words of my novel, which is nice, and this is my last activity with my computer before I write my poem of the day.<a href="#fn011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I guess I could talk about how those are going.</p>
<p>The novel is going interestingly, because it‚Äôs not something that I did even the slightest bit of planning about. More or less, the impetus for the novel was a few vignettes that I‚Äôd been thinking about, which had no temporal connection. As a result, writing them results in something very much the same.</p>
<p>In the poem, I wrote a meta-poem villanelle the first day and a sonnet the second. Today I‚Äôm going to try a free poem, but who knows how well that will go. Huh, just like that, I‚Äôm at over 150 words.</p>

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today is the Feast of All Souls. There‚Äôs an indulgence attached to praying at a graveyard. A friend invited me to go pray at a graveyard with them, and it was really nice. Unfortunately, the rest of today was jam-packed with activities, so I haven‚Äôt really had time to sit and reflect here.</p>
<p>More accurately, I don‚Äôt have time.</p>

<p>First Published: 2022 November 1</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Another month, another monthly reflection.</p>
<p>My goals were:<a href="#fn031" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Blog daily. Eventually this goal will happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch daily. I‚Äôm going to stretch right after this, just so I make sure to do it.</p></li>
<li><p>Figure out how to repair/improve my accordion case. I made some notes today, and I think I should be able to get some of it done by the end of the month.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a poem every day. I did feel like the poems I wrote helped me ease into sleep, and they certainly help me write songs better.</p></li>
<li><p>Finish the newest song I‚Äôm working on.</p></li>
<li><p>Make progress on catching up for BiaY.</p></li>
<li><p>Fill in at least 3 more items on my 24 for 24.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>How‚Äôd we do?</p>
<ol>
<li><p>17/31 blogs. That‚Äôs more than half, so improvement.</p></li>
<li><p>I had about a week where I stretched, so that didn‚Äôt go horribly.</p></li>
<li><p>Turns out repair was as simple as taping it back together, so I gave up on that project.</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote a couple of poems, rough estimate of 12, so could do better.</p></li>
<li><p>I not only finished it, I‚Äôve performed it!</p></li>
<li><p>Lots of progress, I‚Äôm now at day 232.</p></li>
<li><p>I added two new points, so I‚Äôm on schedule if not my goal</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In the next month I‚Äôm going to try:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Blog every day. I believe in this month.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch every day.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a poem every day. I‚Äôm doing a poem a day with some friends, so I‚Äôm accountable there.</p></li>
<li><p>Finish NaNoWriMo successfully</p></li>
<li><p>Make progress towards catching up on BiaY</p></li>
<li><p>At least two entries in 24<span class="math inline"><sup>2</sup></span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Let‚Äôs see how we do!</p>
<p>Outside of my goals, I had a pretty good month. I‚Äôm making new friends and deepening existing relationships, which is always nice.</p>

<h1 id="draft-2-1-november-2022">Draft 2: 1 November 2022</h1>
<p>Last night went well! I ended up doing my two original songs and Stan Roger‚Äôs ‚ÄúMaid on the Shore,‚Äù because it‚Äôs a little bit spooky, which is good Halloween vibes. I had another person comment that the song seemed incredibly sad, and that I seemed sad while performing it, which is fun. It‚Äôs especially fun because they then commented on how not sad I seem otherwise.</p>
<p>I ended up staying later than normal, and played another set. That one was significantly less prepared, so I did two more Stan Rogers songs that I kind of know. It could have gone better but, that‚Äôs the way the cookie crumbles. I realize I never actually figured out how to end them in playing, so it was awkward.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Tonight I‚Äôm playing at the open mic alone for the first time.<a href="#fn041" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I‚Äôm a little nervous, especially since I‚Äôm only like 60% sure what I want to play.

<h1 id="reflections-on-todays-gospel"><a href="reflections-on-readings-31-ordinary-c-22.html">Reflections on Today‚Äôs Gospel</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 October 31</p>
<p>Luke 19:6 ‚ÄúAnd he came down quickly and received him with joy.‚Äù</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>I appreciate how last week we heard about the tax collector who knew he was a sinful man, and this week we hear about Zacchaeus, a tax collector, who is called to the faith. Something that stuck out to me in particular is his line ‚Äúif I have extorted anything from anyone I shall repay it four times over.‚Äù In the homily I listened to, the priest mentioned that he absolutely extorted, which is likely where the other half of his wealth would go.</p>
<p>I, on the other hand, took Zacchaeus at his word. One recurring message these past weeks is the contrast between perceived holiness and actual holiness. ‚ÄúOf course Zacchaeus extorted‚Äù, we and the people at the time would say. And yet, what if he didn‚Äôt?</p>
<p>Too often I find myself judging, making wild extrapolations from minimal data. To me, at least, yesterday‚Äôs Gospel called us to reflect on why we assume the worst from those who we barely know.</p>

<h1 id="nanowrimo-redux"><a href="nanowrimo-2.html">NaNoWriMo Redux</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 October 28</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Way back <a href="nanowrimo.tex">in the initial iteration of this blog</a>, I attempted the National Novel Writer‚Äôs Month (NaNoWriMo). I think<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> that I mostly just tried to hit the wordcount<a href="#fn062" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> in these blog posts. My logic then was that I had far more free time, as I was lacking the obligations of ‚Äúsport, ensembles, (most of) my instruments, much of the studying, a job, etc‚Äù, and so should be able to do it. Today much of that is true as well, and I would really like to see if I can write a novel in a month.</p>
<p>Of course, it‚Äôs not going to be good, but I‚Äôve started actively scheduling time in my day to write<a href="#fn063" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, and it‚Äôs worked well for creating ideas. I also really have a lot of ideas I want to read, and the only realistic way that will happen is if I become the writer for them. Back then I was apparently writing around 750 words a day, which is far more than my posts lately<a href="#fn064" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. But, having now written a book<a href="#fn065" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>, I feel more able to write a long<a href="#fn066" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>-form piece of creative prose.</p>

<h1 id="on-schedules"><a href="schedules.html">On Schedules</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 October 27</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>I find that my life runs better when it‚Äôs more heavily scheduled. Often, this means that I have activities planned for particular times, but it‚Äôs more than that. Lately I‚Äôve been running into a fair number of friends who I realize I‚Äôve lost contact with in the past few months, not through any malice on either of our ends, but simply because it‚Äôs easy to forget people in graduate school.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt want to forget the people who mean a lot to me, so I need to figure out a way to get into the habit of messaging people I care about. I was recently having a conversation with someone where I mentioned that I‚Äôve been called really considerate before because I had written down a reminder, and then remembered the event from it. I don‚Äôt think of that as particularly speaking to my care/memory, because it was just me sending a note into the aether, where it eventually came back to me. The person I was talking to is in the camp of extended memory as memory<a href="#fn071" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, and so assured me that not having the memory to remember important things wasn‚Äôt important, especially since I had a system to figure it out.</p>
<p>Still, though, I know that I have systems which work. I really just need to use them. Maybe I should just set a reminder to text people every few weeks.</p>

<li id="fn071" role="doc-endnote"><p>if you don‚Äôt know what this means, the tl;dr is basically research shows that when we read something we often remember where we read it, rather than what we read, because that‚Äôs more efficient.

<h1 id="on-celtic-knots"><a href="celtic-knots.html">On Celtic Knots</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 October 26</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As I‚Äôve mentioned <a href="celtic-crochet.html">before</a>, I like crocheting Celtic knots. I also like drawing them. One issue I often have with them, though, is that extant knotwork often has motifs other than just an interwoven strand.</p>
<p>A very common motif is some sort of animal shape, which I‚Äôve always struggled to draw. So, recently I decided it would be fun to learn how to draw a dragon,<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> so that I could make better<a href="#fn082" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> knotwork.</p>
<p>It went really slowly at first. Every dragon I drew looked somewhat goofy, which I only realized later was because of a lack of details.<a href="#fn083" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Eventually I figured out how to draw nice<a href="#fn084" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> dragon heads, and even made a convincing knot or two with them. Then I decided to learn to draw wings, for some reason.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve always struggled with wings, probably because of the inherent need for a 3D perspective. For whatever reason, though, this time I drew good enough wings within like 15 minutes of trying, which is fun. Anyways, I‚Äôm enjoying the Celtic knot resurgence in my life.</p>

<h1 id="on-bagpipes"><a href="bagpipes.tex">On Bagpipes</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 October 24</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Yesterday I got to play bagpipes at a friend‚Äôs wedding. It was a lovely service, and I‚Äôm grateful that I got to take part in it.</p>
<p>While I was setting up, I remembered the last service I saw bagpipes at. I was at a funeral for a friend‚Äôs family member. It was there that I thought about how fitting bagpipes are for emotional performances.</p>
<p>Unlike most any other instrument, which requires consistent and continuous breath support, in the bagpipes you blow just the top of your breath each time. When your breathing turns to gasps, you can<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> still play pipes.</p>
<p>Anyways, yesterday‚Äôs occasion was really happy and joyful. It‚Äôs always shocking to me how much people really appreciate hearing music, especially from instruments that they don‚Äôt hear often. Most of the parents and assorted older members of the wedding came up to express their gratitude for my playing, and the bride and groom both were happy for ti. It‚Äôs nice when my hobbies actually get to be helpful.</p>
