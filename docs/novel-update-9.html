<p>First Published: 2022 April 7</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>I’ve kept up with writing the novel since I last talked about it here. I’m <a href="novel-update-8.html">no longer spending time plotting chapters before writing</a> them, which is also working surprisingly well for me. I’ve written more than 100,000 words of it.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>I started posting the book to a website about the time I stopped blogging,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> and it’s gotten nearly forty thousand views, which is incredible to me. Anyways, that’s most of my update for that book.</p>
<p>I’ve also started writing another book, which I’m doing for a writing competition. The goal is to write 55,555 words in 5 weeks, and I’m so far on track for it. It’s been fun to try to stretch myself by writing more!</p>
