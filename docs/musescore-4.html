<p>So I may have completely lost myself and ability to blog these past few weeks, but now seems as good of a time as any to get back into the swing. Musescore 4 recently came out, and it’s an absolutely wild experience.</p>
<p>Musescore<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> is one of the two music engraving software<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> I use.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> It is Free<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>, and the latest version completely overhauled most of the UI, which is nice.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The part that really gets me excited, though, is the difference in how music playback works.</p>
<p>The lead of the project made a long video discussing it, but the summary is basically that there are now sampled sound packs available, and they really bring the quality of the sound so many levels up. I honestly somewhat forgot that not all of the notes were computer generated when I was listening back. It makes it so much more fun to write music when the sounds coming out are nicer.</p>
<p>I said above that I didn’t really get excited about the UI, which is somewhat true. It in many regards is the ideal UI, in that you hardly notice it. I was entering notes generally without issue, and that’s really what software is for.</p>
<p>On a tangent, I told one of my old professors about the new release, and he pointed me to another app which has AI sing vocal words. Now I can finally know what my choral pieces sound like sung!</p>
