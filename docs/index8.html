<p>First Published: 2023 April 13</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p><a href="running-1.html">Last time</a> that I mused about running, I talked about the Doctoral Degree Dash that I did last summer. In it, I ran further than I thought I could.<a href="#fn001" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Since then, I’ve tried running off and on. Lately I’ve been more off than on, but even when I try, I find that I can only really run around a mile in the indoor track I’m using before I lose the ability to keep going.</p>
<p>This week has been shockingly warm here, and it’s made me want to get outside and run. So, tonight I decided to run while praying a rosary,<a href="#fn002" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> to see if that could help motivate me to run longer.</p>
<p>In total, I ended up running just under three miles. I think that there were likely N causes to that.<a href="#fn003" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>First, I actually felt like the distance measurement was accurate. When I run on the indoor track, it claims that 6.6 laps equal a mile, but my watch seems to think it’s closer to eight.</p>
<p>Second, the constant variety in an outdoor run as compared to indoors. When I run on the track, I’m running in a small loop over and over, so it’s harder to want to keep going. On the other hand, when I run outside, especially in the latter half of the run, the faster I go, the sooner I get home.</p>
<p>Third, I actually did something with my mind to stop me from thinking about how miserable it is to run.<a href="#fn004" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>I found out my watch now gives me a lot of statistics about my runs. For instance, my heart rate basically never dropped below 175 while I ran, which is an incredibly high feeling number. My pace also seems to be fairly well correlated to my stride length, which makes sense to me. When I get tired my steps certainly get shorter.</p>
<p>Anyways, I just thought it was interesting how different it feels to run outside than inside. I’m hoping to get in better physical shape this summer, but summer kind of starts now.</p>

<h1 id="on-celtic-knots-again"><a href="celtic-knots-2.html">On Celtic Knots (Again)</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 April 12</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As rapidly happens for me, I’ve run out of ideas to blog about. I’ve been drawing a lot of celtic knots again lately, though, so I suppose that’s something that I can talk about.</p>
<p>Something I’ve always wished and hoped for is the ability to freehand celtic knotwork. As some of my readers might have seen on my Instagram page, every one I make starts with a grid and then a grid of circles representing the holes in the design.</p>
<p>I don’t remember whether I started drawing them like this to practice freehand, or if the two just grew together, but I’ve started drawing celtic knots as single lines, rather than the two dimensional ribbons that I used to draw. It’s absolutely helped me with freehanding, though I’m still nowhere near as good as I would like to be.</p>
<p>As I tried reproducing a cross that I am particularly proud of today, I think I might have found a new solution, though. I made all of the beams going a single direction first, and only then went through and added the crossing pieces.<a href="#fn011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>It worked much better than I expected, though I was still fairly reliant on the grid of my paper. Then again, practicing on a lightly gridded piece of paper is probably my best bet for learning how to quickly find the right sizing.</p>

<h1 id="book-review-of-my-grandmother-asked-me-to-tell-you-shes-sorry"><a href="book-review-grandmother-sorry.html">Book Review of My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She’s Sorry</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 April 11</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>One advantage of the Libby app is that I am able to put a book on hold so that when it is available, I can download it for fourteen days. Since many of the books I want to read others also want to read, it means that I get books spaced out, instead of needing to read every interesting book at once.</p>
<p>One downside of this is that I often have forgotten why I wanted to read the book in the first place. That happened with one book that I read recently, Fredrik Backman’s <em>My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She’s Sorry.</em> It’s the story of a young girl whose grandmother dies of cancer.</p>
<p>The girl is bullied a lot at school, and her relationship with her grandmother revolved around the stories that she would tell of different fantasy lands. When her grandmother dies, Elsa receives different letters that must be delivered to each of the different people who live in the apartment complex with her. Along the way, she learns about the many ways that her grandmother was a complex person who had relationships with everyone in the complex.</p>
<p>I loved the book a lot. The first half or so was a struggle to get through, but I don’t think that I have ever cried more while reading a book. I couldn’t keep tears out of my eyes for around the last quarter of the book. All in all, I would highly recommend the book.</p>

<p>For a variety of reasons,<a href="#fn031" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I haven’t been going to open mics since around February. I went again tonight, and I forgot just how much fun they are. I got to sing a song that I’ve been working on for a while,<a href="#fn032" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> and at the prompting of a friend I sang a great song with another friend.<a href="#fn033" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> The friend who made the recommendation is also a fantastic musician and was willing to take requests. It’s really fun singing Three is a Magic Number<a href="#fn034" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> with other adults, especially when everyone is over trying to look cool.</p>
<p>I’m really excited to make open mics a regular part of my schedule again.</p>

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p><a href="writing-2.html">Fourteen months later</a>, another musing on writing. This month I’ve set the goal of writing more each day. In retrospect, setting that goal on the third of the month, when your first two days were 2494 and 3087 words may not have been the best choice. But, today is also Easter.<a href="#fn041" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <a href="#fn042" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>I realized that there’s value in living a life outside of just writing for the sake of writing. So, while the goal continues, I’m going to be taking Sundays off. Tomorrow I will find the time to write 3600 words<a href="#fn043" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>

<p>Apparently I’ve never reflected on Easter here. That’s interesting to me. This year will not be any different though.

<p>I’ve kept up with writing the novel since I last talked about it here. I’m <a href="novel-update-8.html">no longer spending time plotting chapters before writing</a> them, which is also working surprisingly well for me. I’ve written more than 100,000 words of it.<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>I started posting the book to a website about the time I stopped blogging,<a href="#fn062" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> and it’s gotten nearly forty thousand views, which is incredible to me. Anyways, that’s most of my update for that book.</p>
<p>I’ve also started writing another book, which I’m doing for a writing competition. The goal is to write 55,555 words in 5 weeks, and I’m so far on track for it. It’s been fun to try to stretch myself by writing more!</p>

<h1 id="announcement"><a href="candidate.html">Announcement</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 April 6</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>In the time since I stopped writing this blog, there have been a number of changes in my life.<a href="#fn071" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> One of the most notable of which is that I am now a PhD candidate. I haven’t quite figured out how that changes my own life, but I understand that it generally comes with a few changes in a PhD student’s life.</p>
<p>It often means that you’re beginning work on your thesis. In theory I’ve been working on that for a while.</p>
<p>It often means that you’re done with classes, but I’ve been done needing classes for more than a year and done taking classes for a semester or so.</p>
<p>It often means that your PhD project has been approved, but at least in my program, we never actually get a formal approval for our PhD project from our committee.</p>
<p>Where does that leave me? More or less in the same place, except that I’ve changed my LinkedIn profile to say “PhD Candidate” instead of “PhD Student.” As I write this, I’ve already found a second use case for that! Someone asked me to write a bio for the public talks I’ll be giving again this summer.<a href="#fn072" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>First Published: 2023 April 5</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Wow! A year ago two days from now I <a href="restarting-again">wrote</a> my last reflection on how I gave up on writing this blog. Unlike then, I do kind of regret this break. It wasn’t planned, it just sort of happened.</p>
<p>I have been keeping up on my <a href="creative-hobbies.html">creative</a> hobbies, another difference from last year. However, I do find that I still become ungrounded and disconnected without blogging.<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>So, a few updates:<a href="#fn082" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I passed my candidacy exam!</p></li>
<li><p>I have kept writing the book that I talked about before giving up</p></li>
<li><p>I started a new book</p></li>

<p>First Published: 2023 February 1</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Another month has passed me by! I said my goals last month were</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Blog daily. I have faith in myself.</p></li>
<li><p>Listen to the BiaY and CCCiaY on average once a day each</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch daily</p></li>
<li><p>Write a poem a day</p></li>
<li><p>Write a piece of music a day</p></li>
<li><p>Write through Chapter 35 of the book I’m self publishing</p></li>
<li><p>Practice music daily</p></li>
<li><p>Say a rosary a day</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In reality I:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Blogged 12 times.</p></li>
<li><p>Listen to the BiaY and CCCiaY much less than once averaged</p></li>
<li><p>Stretched at least 10 times</p></li>
<li><p>Actively gave up on the poetry goal.<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Wrote Fifteenish pieces</p></li>
<li><p>Wrote through Chapter 23 of the book I’m self publishing</p></li>
<li><p>Practiced music most days</p></li>
<li><p>Said very few rosaries</p></li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, most of the time, I was not aimlessly wasting away my time, which is one of the reasons I wanted to have more activities to do. I found that my scheduled list of events ceased to be useful about when I started being busy again.</p>
<p>Other things I did this month include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Being asked to play for a musical and spent about 10 hours last weekend recording guitar</p></li>
<li><p>Finished a draft of my 1 page for my third year exam</p></li>
<li><p>Started lifting with friends!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, I’m glad for the month, for all that I really wish that i had recorded more of it here. It passed by in a blur, and that makes me sad.</p>
