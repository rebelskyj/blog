<p>First Published: 2022 December 1</p>

<p>It’s the final month of 2022, which means that it’s my final monthly reflection for the year. I didn’t really set any goals in my <a href="restarting.html">first post of the year</a>, but I did mention five things I was excited for then. I’ll reflect on those at the end of the year</p>
<p>My goals last month were:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Blog every day</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch every day.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a poem every day.</p></li>
<li><p>Finish NaNoWriMo successfully</p></li>
<li><p>Make progress towards catching up on BiaY</p></li>
<li><p>At least two entries in 24<span class="math inline"><em></em><sup>2</sup></span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><p>I blogged 13 times last month, which isn’t my best job ever. Hopefully this month goes better.</p></li>
<li><p>I stretched three times that I recorded, which is still progress technically.</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote a poem a day until the 22 or 23, when I abruptly stopped.</p></li>
<li><p>I <a href="nanowrimo-4.html">did it!</a></p></li>
<li><p>I’m much closer now, though still not there</p></li>
<li><p>I only added one new entry.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>That’s honestly slightly better than I normally do. I realized that I was using time I would often use for blogging for NaNoWriMo, which meant I didn’t want to blog as much. This month I’d like to write at least as much, but I guess I’ll have to see if I can do better about still blogging. Stretching remains a goal of mine that feels so unapproachable for some reason. Writing a poem a day did a lot to force me to write, though in addition to the prose I was doing, I don’t know if I still need it right now. NaNoWriMo was fun, and now my brother has pointed out how easily I could output a large sum of writing. I’m behind on 24<span class="math inline"><em></em><sup>2</sup></span>, which is sad, but I guess encouragement for me to start doing things faster.</p>
<p>My goals for this month are:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Blog every day. This month is the month, I can feel it.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch every day. ibid.</p></li>
<li><p>Write another 50000 word book. I saw that it was very possible last month, so I’d like to show myself that it is again.</p></li>
<li><p>Catch up on BiaY. If I want to finish this year, I need to be caught up by the end of the month.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Time to see how I do!</p>
