<p>Matthew 2:10: “They were overjoyed at seeing the star,”</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>In today’s reading we are told that the Magi were “overjoyed” to see the Holy Family. This upcoming year that’s something I’d like to focus more on. Too often I feel like I do not really engage wholly with the Real Presence in Adoration and Mass.</p>
<p>In the first reading, we hear that “(n)ations shall walk by your light, kings by the radiance of your dawning”<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, which this year for me is a reminder for me that we are not called to keep the joy and love of our Lord hidden beneath shades and covered up. Rather, we are called to be the light in others’ lives through all our words and deeds. As I begin this year, this message is calling me to be the bright light in the lives of those around me.</p>
