<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>If I’ve learned anything these past few days, it’s that I broke a mirror a little more than seven years ago. For those of you who don’t have superstitious family, legend says that breaking a mirror causes seven years of bad luck. Now, I’m not saying this as a comment about my lack of luck these past seven years. As far as I can remember,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> I’ve had a pretty great seven years. However, these past few days have been somehow so much better.</p>
<p>To begin: yesterday afternoon I found out that I had won the Hamilton lottery.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Of course, this was a slightly double-edged sword,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> because I was seeing Book of Mormon earlier in the afternoon. But, when I went to the first show, it was great. I got free gummis, and had a great view of the stage.</p>
<p>After the show, I checked my email. I found out that I had been accepted to a reception at Parliament a professor had applied for on my behalf. That’s super exciting.</p>
<p>Then I went to Hamilton. I was in the middle of the front row, and was tall enough that I could still see most of the show. At the end of the show, I got to take a photo with the conductor!</p>
<p>I love taking photos with techies, because they’re always so much nicer than actors when I ask to take photos with them. So, here’s to another seven years of apparently good luck.</p>

<p>Apparently I broke a mirror a little over seven years ago. Now, this isn’t to say that I have had poor luck before this, but these past few days I’ve felt uniquely lucky. First, yesterday I found out that I had won the lottery for Hamilton.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Today at Book of Mormon,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> I was given free gummi bears. Then, I found out that I had a great view of the stage for the show. When I left the show, I learned that I would get to attend a reception at Parliament in two weeks. At Hamilton, I learned that I was in the center of the front row. Then, to end it, I got to take a photo with the conductor! Overall, life is going great.</p>
