<p>Sometimes when my mental health is feeling really good, I forget that it’s ever bad. And, the reverse is certainly true. When I’m not doing great mentally, my brain cannot bring to memory any time that I’ve been content and calm. I think that’s a really interesting feature of my psyche, though certainly not one I’d prefer. I’ve been trying to think of ways to get around this, and most of them come to some variation of bullet journaling.</p>
<p>I recently saw a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSwpe8r50_o">CGP Grey Video</a> about ways to improve productivity/life in a journal. I’ve been on my same<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> journal since<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> 2019, so filling the physical journal would also be fantastic. I guess I often struggle because I feel like I lack accountability with anything, especially anything self-motivated. But, I would also really like to be in a better place longer, which is fun, so I guess I should focus on it.</p>
