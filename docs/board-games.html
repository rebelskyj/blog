<p>This was supposed to come out Saturday, but life got in the way.</p>
<p>This past Saturday I spent more or less the entire day playing board games. It was really incredible.</p>
<p>The day began with a 6 hour DnD session.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> It was really fun to try an officially published encounter, for all that it lacked the organic feel of homebrew.</p>
<p>After that, I went to a board game night. There I found out that original rules Risk goes significantly faster. I assume this is due to the three following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Starting territories are randomly assigned<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>There’s no initial reinforcement phase<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>The number of units gained from reinforcements grows quickly<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
</ol>
<p>More or less, this meant that I had 15 soldiers<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> to take over Australia. Once I did, I then gained 15 troops from eliminating someone, which spiraled out of control quickly. I think the fact that all of us played an aggressive game also helped.</p>
<p>After that, we played some Anomia, which is always fun.</p>
<p>I then learned how to play euchre. And, then it had been 12 hours of board games!</p>
