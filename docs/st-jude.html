<p>Today I had the opportunity to see the relic of St. Jude.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> It was a beautiful experience, made more so by the fact that I got to sing at a Mass led by the Bishop.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Unfortunately, that did mean that it’s later now than I’d like it to be, and continuing to blog will take more time than I think that I want to spend.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>No progress on eclipse talks.</p></li>
<li><p>The fight was slightly improved, if only because I ran into stuff.</p></li>
<li><p>Let’s go! Continuing to blog</p></li>
<li><p>I stretched this morning. I had planned to stretch again tonight, but it seems a little late for that.</p></li>
<li><p>No exercise outside of walking around.</p></li>
<li><p>I woke up before seven again, which is nice. I’ll also sleep in tomorrow, because I’m still recovering a bit.</p></li>
<li><p>I woke before my alarm!</p></li>
<li><p>In addition to praying in front of the relic, going to Mass, and spending some time praying after Mass, I also spent fifteen minutes in silent prayer at the chapel on my walk to work. I forgot how much that really makes my entire day better. I left and just felt better.</p></li>
<li><p>I finished tomorrow’s chapter today!</p></li>
<li><p>I don’t know if the net progress on plotting question is relevant anymore.</p></li>
<li><p>No poetry.</p></li>
<li><p>No album work.</p></li>
<li><p>After going to the chapel, writing things I like about myself was much easier.</p></li>
<li><p>Three things I’m excited for was also easier.</p></li>
<li><p>Gratitude journaling was as well.</p></li>
<li><p>I think that I tried to cultivate joy.</p></li>
