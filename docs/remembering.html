<p>First Published: 2022 November 8</p>

<p>Yesterday was my grandmother’s birthday. It’s a strange day for me, because it is a little sad. I still miss her, if only intellectually.</p>
<p>On the other hand, though, I can no longer remember most of what used to make me sad about her absence, let alone her. The only pieces of her voice that I can recall are from the voicemail that my dear brother had<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> for the longest time. When I try to picture her face, I can only see the photographs of her that we keep in our home.</p>
<p>It’s strange for me to realize that I’ve been without grandparents for nearly half my life now. A lot of the poems I’ve been writing this month have centered around memory, especially the generational memory that I feel like I’m missing.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In retrospect, November is a month that always has so many calls to my past, so it’s unsurprising that my reflection<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> would start centering on them.</p>
<p>So what is remembering? Is it the emotional ties that we keep to what’s now gone? Is it the intellectual knowledge of something now lost? Is it something else? I don’t really know, but I’m glad I at least had this to reflect on it for a bit.</p>
