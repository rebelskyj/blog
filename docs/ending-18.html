<p>As I finish this post in the early hours of the morning, 2018 is officially over. And, as of the end of this post, this blog has 125 posts, which is a surprisingly nice and round number for being completely unplanned.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> So, I thought I’d use this to look back at 2018.</p>
<p>2018 was a really fun year for me. Due to it being late, and my having been up for a while, I don’t remember most of it. However, looking back, five big positive events for me this year were: medaling at the Conference Swim and Dive meet, joining the Track and Field team, beginning the bagpipes, going to London,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and finally having a trimmed beard.</p>
<p>Of these, I think the final will prove to be the most impactful on my life in 2019.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Since I reflected on five big changes in 2018, I feel like I should also list five things that excite me about 2019, which are:<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> learning the accordion, figuring out what I’m going to do after college, being a senior, watching my little brother’s final high school memories being made, continuing to grow at the instruments I’m already taking.</p>
<p>Of course, three<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> of the items that were most memorable to me about 2018 as I was writing this post weren’t things that I knew would be happening at the beginning of the year.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> So, more than anything, I’m excited to find out what new and wonderful events will change my life in 2019. In the<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> words of the immortal Caesar, <em>venio, video, vivo.</em> In English, that would be:say<span>I come, I see, I live.</span> If I can’t fail to be pretentious on New Year’s Eve, then when? Anyways, best of luck to anyone reading this, and a happy end of the Christmas Season.</p>

<p>Today marks the end of 2018. As of the end of this post, I’ve posted 125 posts, which is a surprisingly nice and round number.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> 2018 was a really fun year for me.</p>
<p>Looking back, some big changes include: medaling at the Conference Swim and Dive meet, joining the Track and Field team, beginning the bagpipes, going to London,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> and finally having a trimmed beard.</p>
