<p>Mark 13:31 ‚ÄúHeaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.‚Äù</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>Today‚Äôs readings are fun for me because they‚Äôre more mystical than normal. But, despite the allegories and metaphors, there are some facts we can pull out. First, eventually mankind will reach its end. Second, we don‚Äôt know when it will be. Third, the Lord will protect his people when the world does end. Fourth, the Lord will endure, as will his works.</p>
<p>Personally, I appreciate the reminder that time is limited. Regardless of when the deadline is, it still exists. And, as often happens when I realize the existence of deadlines, it makes me more aware of the people in my life. So, today is a great day to remind those you love that you do, those you trust that you have faith in them, and those you hated that you forgive them. The Year of Grace is almost over, and so we should think about where we‚Äôve come in the past year.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today‚Äôs readings tell us two important things. First, eventually mankind will reach its end. Second, we don‚Äôt know when it will be. I guess also third, the Lord will take care of us, and fourth, he‚Äôll still be here.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a nice reminder that, try as we may to prevent it, we can‚Äôt control the future. Every single one of us has free will, and the ability to make each day the best or worst that it could be. But, everyone else also gets to make that choice.</p>

<p>For some reason, writing that title made me think of the song by Jon Svetky, ‚ÄúWhat We Talk About When We Talk About Love‚Äù.<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> But, as I wrote a post for today, I got more than 500 words in when I realized it wasn‚Äôt something I could post.</p>
<p>Most of the time, I know that I won‚Äôt be able to post a writing before I even start it. Or, in some cases, I get a paragraph or so in before I realize that it shouldn‚Äôt be published.</p>
<p>But, maybe because of discussions I‚Äôve had with my class in the Diary course I‚Äôve been taking, I reflected today on what we don‚Äôt write. Obviously, despite <a href="disclaimer.html">my disclaimer</a>, I‚Äôm not going to post things that I think will reflect horribly on me in my immediate future. So, I‚Äôm not going to write about how much I may hate a certain person, or how frustrated I am about a certain event that I have the wrong amount of control over, because it doesn‚Äôt help me at all to write about it.<a href="#fn022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>But, there are other things that don‚Äôt go here. As one of my classmates mentioned, we don‚Äôt mention the everyday. Of course, since I‚Äôve been scraping the barrel sometimes to get a post, I do mention some of the everyday.</p>
<p>We don‚Äôt mention what we‚Äôre ashamed of. Obviously, this is something that is different now from the typical image of a diary. Here, I‚Äôm publishing my work with the expectation of others reading it, much like early diaries. So, I can‚Äôt put personal information that might be hurtful to someone near me, because that‚Äôs unfair to them.</p>
<p>All this is to say, I‚Äôve realized that, much as <a href="http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~rebelsky/musings/">my inspiration</a> did in his third essay, I can‚Äôt always publish how I feel, because it may not be appropriate to the facts and realities of relationships I have. Anyways, before I start sounding maudlin,<a href="#fn023" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> I‚Äôve realized how helpful it is for me to force myself to write something every day, and to publish it, even if I‚Äôm not ready to release it. This has definitely been<a href="#fn024" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> a good way for me to grow myself, both in terms of introspection and presentation.</p>

<p>As <a href="will-he-or-wont-he.html">I mentioned a while ago</a>, I‚Äôve been meaning to go to the London Uillean Piper‚Äôs club. I finally made it.</p>
<p>It was really fun, and I‚Äôm glad I went once, if only for the chance to try the instrument. However, since I didn‚Äôt get back until nearly 12:15 in the morning, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to be something I go to again. But, I‚Äôm glad I had the chance to try it once</p>

<p>First Published 2018 November 14</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>One of the things I tend to forget is that I have somewhat of a fear of heights. More than that, I have a fear of jumping off tall heights. Maybe that isn‚Äôt a fear, the more that I think about it, and just a reasonable reaction.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, since I was never afraid of one meter, seldom of three, and not at all afraid of jumping off of five meter platforms, I decided that I would try jumping off of the 10 meter platform tonight. I got to the 7 meter, and began climbing up to the 10.</p>
<p>I didn‚Äôt realize how close to the roof I was, especially since it seemed so high before I started. Wow that was scary.</p>
<p>But, I jumped. I was in the air way too long. And then I hit the water. Next week I‚Äôll try going in head first.</p>

<p>As most of you alleged readers know, I have somewhat bad vision. And, since we live in the future, we have wearable technology that corrects for that. Most of the time, I correct my vision with glasses. On occasion, I correct it with contacts. And then there are the nights like tonight.</p>
<p>While going about my day, I paused in my room to do some homework.<a href="#fn051" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Upon preparing to leave the dorm for a talk about maps that shaped America,<a href="#fn052" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> I realized I couldn‚Äôt find my glasses. So, knowing that I knew how to get to the talk fine without seeing detail, I set off.</p>
<p>London is a much different city with poor vision. Crowds of people, who normally I didn‚Äôt register, suddenly seemed so much more sinister. My own shadow, distorted by street lights, gave me pause, as I thought I had a pursuer.</p>
<p>But, I made it to the talk safe, oddly enough. Today was nice, if only to remind myself both how blessed I am to have correctable vision, and how even the smallest of changes can drastically affect how we see the world.</p>

<p>Tonight, I had the lovely fortune of seeing George Furth and Steven Sondheim‚Äôs <em>Company</em> performed at the Gielgud Theatre. It was a show where the main character‚Äôs sex was flipped. No longer about Bobby, this show was about Bobbi.</p>
<p>It was incredibly enjoyable. The set mostly took the form of small, modular pieces which were surrounded by neon lights. They moved back and forth and up and down stage, and in some instances even up and down vertically. The music was beautiful, as is to be expected.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the orchestra was above the actors, rather than in a pit. The actors and actresses all performed brilliantly.</p>
<p>As to the production itself, for most of the show I‚Äôm unsure how different it was from the original script. I went in mostly blind, as I do for most musicals. However, I had seen a recording of the song ‚ÄúBarcelona.‚Äù</p>
<p>In this version, where the main character sleeps with a man, rather than the original which had the genders switched, there were some differences in how I felt as an audience member. Despite the fact that the staging seemed almost identical, it‚Äôs interesting how different some of the lines and blocking felt when delivered from a person of the opposite sex.</p>
<p>Overall, it was very enjoyable</p>

<p>Mark 12:44-44 ‚Äú A poor widow also came and put in two small coins worth a few cents. Calling his disciples to himself, he said to them, ‚ÄòAmen, I say to you, this poor widow put in more than all the other contributors to the treasury. For they have all contributed from their surplus wealth, but she, from her poverty, has contributed all she had, her whole livelihood.‚Äô‚Äù</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today‚Äôs Gospel gives the message that I‚Äôve always had the hardest part reconciling with the teachings we see in daily religious life. The Lord says that the widow‚Äôs gift, though small, means the most, as she has the least to give.</p>
<p>As a Catholic, I am taught that faith is a call to action. The sentiment that ‚Äúfaith without action is dead‚Äù is not an uncommon one. So, why is it that we see good deeds done by the faithless as anything but the miracles that they are?</p>
<p>When a faithful person performs a good deed, it shouldn‚Äôt be remarkable. They are simply doing what their soul tells them to do. When they make the choice to not do good, it takes an effort. But, someone who doesn‚Äôt believe doesn‚Äôt have that call. For those without faith, if we believe that faith is what calls you to action, there is no call to do good.</p>
<p>And yet, the faithless still do good. To me, that‚Äôs the most beautiful part of life</p>

<p>Assuming anyone actaully reads my daily posts, they might have noticed that yesterday, for the first time in more than 70 days, I didn‚Äôt update. In a way, it was sort of a relief. I knew that at some point, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to update every day, so getting it out of the way was a relief. I had visited Belgium to see a friend, and didn‚Äôt find the time to make a post. I also didn‚Äôt write for NaNoWriMo, but since I was well ahead of schedule,<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I‚Äôm not too worried. Anyways, now I have the difficult decision: do I keep with one a day, or do I write two today?</p>
<p>I‚Äôm unsure which I‚Äôll do</p>

<p>Today is Friday. It‚Äôs also the Friday ending what my host university calls ‚ÄúReading Week.‚Äù As class ended last week, my professor made a note of that, before commenting that little to no reading happens during reading week.</p>
<p>I planned on reading during reading week. But, Monday turned into Tuesday turned into today, and I did no studying. Somehow, I even read less of my pleasure reading than I tend to do. But, I did destress, which is important, since I didn‚Äôt realize how ragged I‚Äôd been running myself. So, I guess I read the right amount?</p>
