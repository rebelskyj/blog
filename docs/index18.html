<p>I’ve recently been thinking about how to live my life more intentionally. Something that I’ve been having a lot of luck with in the past days is having a list of activities to do each day. I really like how well it’s been going for me.</p>

<p>Lasterday I wrote about creative hobbies, so it seems only fair that today I talk about one of mine. Currently I’m moving my art from celtic knots to not doing to some symmetric art. My current piece is a line art that has vertical and horizontal symmetry.</p>
<p>I’ve almost finished, so have to decide on my next one.</p>

<p>John 2:4: “Jesus said to her, “Woman, how does your concern affect me? My hour has not yet come.””</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As I mentioned <a href="reflections-on-readings-2-ordinary-c.html">last time I read these</a>, my family really likes the readings that happen this week. This time around, the concept that the Lord’s “hour ha[d] not yet come” really stuck with me, because it says that He was there with his disciples.</p>
<p>I know that I’ve always been taught that this was the beginning of His ministry, so I’m unsure why he already has disciples. But, it’s still beautiful that He listened to His mother without question.</p>

<p>I’ve <a href="toffee-recipe.html">written before</a> about how I make toffee, but I made it again for the first time in a long while today, and that seemed appropriate to blog about here. As before, the recipe is 1:1 sugar and butter, heated to hot then cooled. This time, however, as I have <a href="candied-orange.html">too much chocolate</a>, I decided to make the toffee the way most of the internet suggests I should: chocolate covered. It came out well!</p>
<p>I guess it’s unsurprising that a recipe which<a href="#fn041" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> is just 1 part chocolate, sugar, and butter, could come out well. Nonetheless, it was really fun to see that I can, in fact, make things taste good. I unfortunately didn’t let my chocolate cool enough before mixing it into the cookie dough but that’s life I suppose, I’ll have moreso chocolate than chocolate chip cookie.</p>

<p>First Published: 2022 January 14</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Some times in my life I really think of as listening times. On some occasions that means hearing a friend as they share something deep and personal in their life. At others, it means hearing a story or tale as it weaves. Still others are when I get to sit in silence and hear my own thoughts as they interplay with the natural<a href="#fn051" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> noises around me. And finally, sometimes I get to listen to intentional music.</p>
<p>Tonight is one of those nights. I was reminded of a fantastic curated playlist that an amazing person made for me, and got to listen to it. There were no familiar songs on it, and only a few familiar artists, which made the experience fantastic. Much like me, the playlist generator used so many genres and styles, which gave a very nice experience</p>

<p>Walking in winter is always interesting to me, especially when it’s<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> warmer. Tonight it was around freezing. That being the case, I was wearing my coat unzipped, which a friend remarked on. I thought back to childhood, where my ideal winter outfit was often warm gloves, a hat, boots, shorts, and a t-shirt.</p>
<p>As I’ve grown older, some of that’s changed. I’ve adapted to colder feet, and I’ve grown my hair to keep my ears warm. My chest and legs have started getting colder, which is a little sad. But, gloves<a href="#fn062" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> remain my most crucial winter clothing article.</p>

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Sometimes when my mental health is feeling really good, I forget that it’s ever bad. And, the reverse is certainly true. When I’m not doing great mentally, my brain cannot bring to memory any time that I’ve been content and calm. I think that’s a really interesting feature of my psyche, though certainly not one I’d prefer. I’ve been trying to think of ways to get around this, and most of them come to some variation of bullet journaling.</p>
<p>I recently saw a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSwpe8r50_o">CGP Grey Video</a> about ways to improve productivity/life in a journal. I’ve been on my same<a href="#fn071" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> journal since<a href="#fn072" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> 2019, so filling the physical journal would also be fantastic. I guess I often struggle because I feel like I lack accountability with anything, especially anything self-motivated. But, I would also really like to be in a better place longer, which is fun, so I guess I should focus on it.</p>

<p>Right now I’m reading a lot of LitRPG’s and some nearby genres. I’m not sure why, but if I had to guess, it’s mostly because the books generally expect minimal mental effort from me and have interesting premises.

<h1 id="draft-0.6-20-january-2022">Draft 0.6: 20 January 2022</h1>
<p>The major motivation of my research is bridging the gap between known terrestrial life, composed of complex chains of amino acids, and the assumed lack of life extraterrestrially. In the heat of stars, where heavier elements are formed, the intense radiation will prevent any sort of molecular bonds from occurring, leaving us with ionized monatomic species. Somewhere after these atoms are ejected from stars, they can form simple molecular species.</p>
<p>As these small species keep interacting, larger and more complex chemistries have been observed as occurring. Knowing exactly what species are present in these large molecular clouds is essential in order to generate accurate reaction mechanisms.</p>
<p>Something something there’s a need for rotational spectroscopy something something.</p>

<p>The major motivation of my research is bridging the gap between known terrestrial life, composed of complex chains of amino acids, and the assumed lack of life extraterrestrially. In the heat of stars, where heavier elements are formed, the intense radiation will prevent any sort of molecular bonds from occurring, leaving us with ionized monatomic species On the other end of the question of life, prior research has shown that a terrestrial and aqueous collection of amino acids will spontaneously self assemble into repeating patterns (life) when exposed to electricity.</p>
<p>The question then becomes how we can move from these single-atom ion into amino acids. Prior research has found many molecules which could be amino acid precursors, but there are yet to be complete models which produce these amino acids. As a result, we search for ions and radicals which would form these atoms.</p>
<h1 id="draft-0-a-text-i-sent">Draft 0: A text I sent</h1>
<p>So yeah our big motivation is that like life exists (allegedly) and we’re curious how close to life you can get without a rocky planet. We know if you put a bucket of amino acids together and shock them you get life, but most historic research suggests amino acids only form on planets. Bc space there’s lots of radicals and ions (bc nothing to react w and radiation), so we look at those as precursors</p>
