<p>First Published: 2019 January 13</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>We’re getting ready to return to Grinnell. As a result, we decided to clear out our food. We had around two pounds of bread, a pound of brown sugar, salt,<a href="#fn011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and a packet of yeast. So, I decided to make bread.</p>
<p>With the one packet of yeast added to most of the flour, I dumped in the very precise measurements of “some” salt and brown sugar. That being accomplished,<a href="#fn012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> I added water to the flour. As I realized that there was still far too much flour, I found out we also had extra milk. So, I added more flour, and I<a href="#fn013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> added milk to the flour, and continued to work.</p>
<p>I then got bored while kneading, so picked up the dough and kneaded as I walked and visited other rooms. After letting it rise for 2.5 hours,<a href="#fn014" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> I rekneaded, and let rest for the entirely unreasonable length of 3 minutes.<a href="#fn015" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> I put it in the oven and walked away for ten minutes.</p>
<p>When I returned, the bread looked more like a cake. It had risen quite nicely. Of course, it wasn’t browning, even after 30 minutes, so I bumped the temp from 350 to 400.<a href="#fn016" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> It still didn’t brown, but did turn a nice light brown colour.<a href="#fn017" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Reviews from housemates were positive. As for myself, I’d give it a solid neutral. As my father would say, “c’est la vie.”<a href="#fn018" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>First Published: 2019 January 16</p>
<p>Isaiah 40:1: “Comfort, give comfort to my people, says your God.”</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today’s readings, as are to be expected from the day of the Lord’s baptism, are rather joyful. To me, the line which best sums up this week’s message is the first of Isaiah Chapter 40. The readings focus on the comfort and knowledge that the Lord has come, loves us, and chooses us each and every day.</p>
<p>In the Gospel itself, I love the fact that Luke makes it clear that “the Holy Spirit descended upon him in <strong>bodily form</strong>,”<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#fn022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> while the other two synoptic Gospels only state that the Spirit descends. For me, at least, part of the faith that is so important is the physical nature. As we’re taught about sacraments, they’re physical manifestations of internal realities. Unlike other Christian faiths, we believe that the Body and Blood is truly present in the Eucharist.</p>

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>In a class I took last semester, Creative Cartography, one of the ways we experimented with making maps was via timelapses. I very much enjoyed the process, and repeated it later in the making of the growing of my beard.<a href="#fn041" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> When I shaved my beard, I again tried a timelapse. And, recently, I tried doing so while working on a doodle that I enjoyed.</p>
<p>It’s a really fun process, and it’s a good way for me personally to do activities more mindfully. If you haven’t tried making them in the past, I’d recommend trying to make one, as it’s very rewarding.</p>

<p>Today, I had the lovely pleasure of watching the 1985 classic American film <em>Commando</em>, staring Arnold Schwarzenegger with 20 or so other members of my team. All in all, it was a great movie for why we chose it.</p>
<p>The plot was straightforward enough that the chatting and constant interjections didn’t make it hard to follow. The dialogue was dumb, but punny. The set was destroyed often. There was a high body count. So, what more could you really ask for in a college men’s athletic movie night?<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>First Published: 2019 January 08</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today, as with most days for the next few weeks, I dove. Our goal was to run through every dive, with the added hope that I might be able to put inward two and a half back in.<a href="#fn071" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Instead, I remembered why I hate inwards.</p>
<p>In front category dives, I tend to have an easy time. Regardless of how I ride the board, I can generally save it.</p>
<p>In back dives, I just need to remember to swing my arms. And, I do that often enough.</p>
<p>For reverse, I always know that I’ve gotten off the board too quickly.</p>
<p>But, for inward, the only element I really need to throw a quickly rotating dive is a good toe drive. That is, I need to throw my feet back as they come up from the board. Throwing my feet is scary, and makes me think I might hit the board.<a href="#fn072" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> So, today’s inward double attempts were interesting.</p>
<p>On the first, I underthrew just enough that I landed in what the lifeguard called a “perfect cannonball.”<a href="#fn073" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> The second I underthrew to the point that it turned into a one and a half, because I knew I wouldn’t make it, and I’ve never been horribly fond of hurting my back.<a href="#fn074" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> After recognizing this problem and addressing it through an inward dive,<a href="#fn075" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> I thought myself ready to again attempt inward double. Instead of it being under, I had a wonderful toe drive. In fact, I rotated so well that I was able to kick out at the double above the board.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this meant that I was over on the dive, and it didn’t feel pleasant. Had it been a leadup for inward two and a half or double on one meter, it would have been great. As it was, however, it was just painful. But, tomorrow is another day, and another chance to try again.</p>

<p>First Published: 2019 January 07</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As those of you who’ve been following the progress of the baking competition might know, I’ve been working hard to perfect my recipe. Now that I’m at the training trip, I thought it important to try making the recipe here, as the oven and stove might behave differently. Oddly enough, the butter seems to behave differently, though that may just be my failure to cook.</p>
<p>I’ve learned that if you boil butter, it will eventually incorporate a lot of air. If you wait until that point to fold in chocolate, you end up with a more stable final project. It received positive reviews from all, including my alleged competition.</p>
<p>For the sake of not trying to remember, below is the recipe.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Combine 1 egg, 1 egg yolk, 2 tablespoons and 2 teaspoons sugar, and 1 tablespoon flour in a bowl.</p></li>
<li><p>Mix until fully incorporated</p></li>
<li><p>Grease a cupcake tin and wipe<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Melt 1/2 stick butter in pan, stirring often</p></li>
<li><p>When butter has boiled and begins to rapidly expand in size, remove from heat</p></li>
<li><p>Stir in 2.7 oz bittersweet chocolate pieces, and when fully mixed, add the egg mixture.</p></li>
<li><p>Once fully incorporated together, pour into muffin tin and cook at 350 F.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove from oven when the sides have begun to pull away and feel mostly solid when touched.</p></li>
<li><p>While still warm, flip onto plate to remove from trays.</p></li>

<p>Isaiah 60:4A: “Raise your eyes and look about; they all gather and come to you.”</p>

<p>Today’s readings focus on the first time that we see people recognize the Lord in his human incarnation.<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> And, as the other readings point out, this is the answer to Isaiah’s prophecy, that “[Jerusalem’s] light has come, the glory of the Lord shines upon [it].”<a href="#fn092" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> And, perhaps because I went to a Mass in Haitian Creole, where the priest made a point of mention that the Mass is the same in any language, other than the words themselves,<a href="#fn093" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> that’s the part of the readings I’ve focused on.</p>
<p>The first reading tells us that all will gather and come to see the Lord. And, as the Mass is the same in every language, we can truly be a catholic<a href="#fn094" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> church, one where all can join in the song.<a href="#fn095" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> In this way, the message of today’s readings is especially relevant to the random happenstance of life.
