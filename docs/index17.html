<p>When <a href="running.html">last I mused about running</a>, I mentioned that I had achieved my goal of running 3 continuous miles. My goal with that post was to prepare for the race I ran today, which at the time was set to 5.39 miles, but ended up being 5.1 or so. My mile splits were much more regular, and I ended up going faster in my first three miles today than I did in my 5K, which is fun to realize as I write this post.</p>
<p>That being said, I did not train really at all in August. Near as I can tell, I went for a single run in August, which was only about 1.5 miles. Still, I decided I wanted to run the race today, and I managed to run the entire time.<a href="#fn001" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> It’s really cool to know that I can, in fact, run as long as I end up needing to.</p>
<p>All this being said, I still don’t really love running. I think I’m going to take up swimming again. Expect future musings on that.</p>

<h1 id="monthly-reflection"><a href="reflection-august-2022.html">Monthly Reflection</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 September 1</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Wow, once again, I have watched as a month slipped by my life. I finally finished the journal I started in November of 2019 which is really exciting.<a href="#fn011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>My goals were:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Blog daily! As with last month, I prefer having a record of my times. I also have an idea for a chemistry book/curriculum I’d like to work on, so may post notes there.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch daily. I really do feel better when I stretch more</p></li>
<li><p>Be able to run 5.49 miles. As I mentioned, I need to be able to, so might as well try.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep up with my reading buddy for BiaY. That feels self-explanatory to me</p></li>
<li><p>Practice guitar daily. I’m doing open mics with a friend<a href="#fn012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> and I’d like to not hold them back.</p></li>
<li><p>Practice accordion at least 3x a week. The above friends mentioned wanting some accordion on a song, so I’d better get better.</p></li>
<li><p>Revise the book I wrote? I don’t know if this is a good goal, but I would sure like it to be. I have certainly become a better writer since I started the book and I’d sure like to demonstrate that to myself.</p></li>
<li><p>Write 20000 words of a new story? I have an idea for an urban fantasy novel. Well. I have a few things I’d like to explore at least. At worst I can probably just write the sequel to the above book.</p></li>
<li><p>Decide what I want to write my Research Proposal on. That’s the next exam in my life, so I should work on that.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Well once again, let’s see how we did:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>I wrote a total of 13 blog posts over I think 10 or so days. I did work on the curriculum a bit, but not as much as I would have liked to.</p></li>
<li><p>I did not do this, and I can really feel it.</p></li>
<li><p>I don’t even think I ran that much total this past month.</p></li>
<li><p>I did it! We made it up to day 151 in August.<a href="#fn013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I think I practiced every other day, but managed to keep up.</p></li>
<li><p>I don’t think I did, but everyone seemed ok with my performance this past Monday, so maybe I did well enough.</p></li>
<li><p>I did not revise it at all.</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote about 1700 words</p></li>
<li><p>I have not done this</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, I met almost none of my goals, but I’m ok with that. I was having a rough month in a lot of respects, so I’m mostly proud of myself for doing as well as I could. That being said, I’m going to strive to do better this month. So, monthly goals are:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Blog daily! The more I blog, the better I do at blogging, and I think it also helps me with writing more generally.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch daily. My body is starting to ache fairly often, and I’d like it to not do that.</p></li>
<li><p>Manage to run the entire race tomorrow. That’s not really a monthly goal so much as a goal I’d like to accomplish, but it goes here anyways.</p></li>
<li><p>Continue keeping up with my BiaY buddy.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a poem every day. I find that my ability to write songs has started to suffer, plus I really like filling my notebook more quickly.</p></li>
<li><p>Journal every day. As much as I love this blog, its inherent semi-public nature means that there are a lot of topics I won’t<a href="#fn014" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> write about in it. I still think it’s good for me to discuss them, plus I need to fill this new notebook.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I’ve taken the musical goals off the list because I don’t really know if that’s a goal I have anymore. I certainly want to practice enough to not hold my band back, but that’s not necessarily a quantity thing for me anymore. Now it’s more about learning specific songs.</p>

<p>First Published: 2022 September 1</p>
<p>Luke 14:14 “blessed indeed will you be because of their inability to repay you. For you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous”</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>The common theme this week I saw was a fairly straightforward exhortation to seek the Lord our G-d. The best way to do so, as the Gospel points out, is through corporal works of mercy. That is, seeing Christ in the poor and needy, and giving to them.</p>
<p>As I thought about the Gospel, something else came to mind as well. We can never repay the Lord for any of the good that He gives us. In that way, striving to be like the Lord means doing good to those who cannot do good to us.</p>
<p>The Second Reading is also powerful this week, especially since I’m currently reading the part of the Bible referenced in it. In this reading, St. Paul reminds us of the difference between seeking Christ and seeking the Father without Christ. Without Christ, the Lord’s presence is too awesome for us to behold.</p>

<p>Thanks for following me on this journey! I think that I revisited it a little too infrequently for the hope of intentionality to seep too far. I did feel motivated to try a few more things these past weeks. Now that I’ve completed the list, I think this is something I want to try again with each following year of my life. There are an infinite number of things that I can do, which means there’re an infinite number of things I haven’t done yet.</p>

<p>Psalm 117:1 “Praise the LORD, all you nations!</p>
<p>Extol him, all you peoples”</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Oh boy is there a lot to talk about this week. The theme common to all three readings was that of the Lord as Father, especially Father of All.</p>
<p>However, there are also other pieces to talk about. The Second Reading was written by Paul to the Jewish people. In it, he reminds us that, just as children may not understand the reason for punishment or discipline from a just parent, so too do we sometimes misunderstand the reasons for suffering in our own lives.</p>

<h1 id="board-games"><a href="board-games.html">Board Games</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 August 22</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>This was supposed to come out Saturday, but life got in the way.</p>
<p>This past Saturday I spent more or less the entire day playing board games. It was really incredible.</p>
<p>The day began with a 6 hour DnD session.<a href="#fn051" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> It was really fun to try an officially published encounter, for all that it lacked the organic feel of homebrew.</p>
<p>After that, I went to a board game night. There I found out that original rules Risk goes significantly faster. I assume this is due to the three following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Starting territories are randomly assigned<a href="#fn052" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>There’s no initial reinforcement phase<a href="#fn053" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>The number of units gained from reinforcements grows quickly<a href="#fn054" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
</ol>
<p>More or less, this meant that I had 15 soldiers<a href="#fn055" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> to take over Australia. Once I did, I then gained 15 troops from eliminating someone, which spiraled out of control quickly. I think the fact that all of us played an aggressive game also helped.</p>
<p>After that, we played some Anomia, which is always fun.</p>
<p>I then learned how to play euchre. And, then it had been 12 hours of board games!</p>

<p>This was supposed to come out Friday, but life got in the way.</p>
<p>Anyways, this past Friday I went to my first supper club. It’s apparently a Wisconsin thing. More or less, it felt like a restaurant, with a major difference: you did all the food ordering before getting a seat, only getting a table when your food was ready. It was great to see a friend before they leave Madison!</p>

<p>In October of 2018, I apparently wrote about <a href="writing-a-song.html">writing a song</a>. Despite the fact that I’ve done a lot of composing, I realize now that most of it happened in the dark ages.<a href="#fn071" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> As a result, I don’t know that I’ve talked about writing a song at all.</p>
<p>Anyways, I wrote most of a song, which I’ve shared about previously.<a href="#fn072" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> I shared the song with the person I play open mics with yesterday, and he liked it.<a href="#fn073" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> It’s really scary to share things you make with people around you, so I’m glad for his reaction.

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Like my <a href="open-mic.html">last post on the topic</a>, I missed writing and uploading a post last night because I was at an open mic. Unlike last time, though, I was performing at this one. A friend from my graduate program and I have played at this open mic twice now, and it was a great time.</p>
<p>The vibes are really nice at the place. The crowd is generally supportive but not hyperfocused on the music.<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The other performers were almost universally better than me, but incredibly supportive.<a href="#fn082" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> So yeah!

<h1 id="reflections-on-todays-gospel"><a href="reflections-on-readings-20-ordinary-c-22.html">Reflections on Today’s Gospel</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 August 14</p>
<p>Jeremiah 38:4 “Then the princes said to the king, ‘This man ought to be put to death. He is weakening the resolve of the soldiers left in this city and of all the people, by saying such things to them; he is not seeking the welfare of our people, but their ruin.’”</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Again I start this reflection reflecting on the lack of cheer. All three readings point to a single common element today: the Peace we are promised is not temporal. That is, though living a Christian life will bring us peace, that does not mean we will live without conflict. Each reading points to a different way in which our struggles to live as Christ commands will be redoubled by the world.</p>
<p>In the first reading, we hear Jeremiah being condemned by the nobility in the city. In the context of today’s readings, this reminds us that to live a holy life is to be persecuted for righteousness. Now, this isn’t to say that people being mad at your choices means they’re holy, there are plenty of ways to be persecuted rightly. But, to truly live a life centered around the Lord’s will means going against the powers of the day.</p>
<p>The second reading reminds us that, though our spiritual struggles are painful, we are spared from the worst of it. Indeed, there is no way that we could redeem ourselves through merit alone. It is through the grace of our Lord alone that we have the strength to resist sin, and it is through His sacrifice that we are redeemed. This reading reminds us that, though we can always strive more, we should strive always to model Christ.</p>
<p>The final reading is in many regards the hardest. The Church has always had enemies with temporal power, and hopefully there’s no need to be reminded that Christ suffered for us. Instead, the Gospel today tells us that even the people we love most in this world may be at odds with us in following a holy life. There’s an expression I’ve heard, that all love on Earth is only good in so far as how it orients us to He who is Love, but having it expressed as Christ does showcases the pain. There is a more joyful reading though: the love a parent has for their child is nothing compared to the love that Love has for us.</p>
