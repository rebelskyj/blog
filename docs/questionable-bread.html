<p>We’re getting ready to return to Grinnell. As a result, we decided to clear out our food. We had around two pounds of bread, a pound of brown sugar, salt,<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and a packet of yeast. So, I decided to make bread.</p>
<p>With the one packet of yeast added to most of the flour, I dumped in the very precise measurements of <span>“#1”</span> salt and brown sugar. That being accomplished,<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> I added water to the flour. As I realized that there was still far too much flour, I found out we also had extra milk. So, I added more flour, and I<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> added milk to the flour, and continued to work.</p>
<p>I then got bored while kneading, so picked up the dough and kneaded as I walked and visited other rooms. After letting it rise for 2.5 hours,<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> I rekneaded, and let rest for the entirely unreasonable length of 3 minutes.<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> I put it in the oven and walked away for ten minutes.</p>
<p>When I returned, the bread looked more like a cake. It had risen quite nicely. Of course, it wasn’t browning, even after 30 minutes, so I bumped the temp from 350 to 400.<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> It still didn’t brown, but did turn a nice light brown colour.<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Reviews from housemates were positive. As for myself, I’d give it a solid neutral. As my father would say, <span>“#1”</span><a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
