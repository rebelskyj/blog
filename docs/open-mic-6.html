<p>First Published: 2023 June 6</p>

<p>Oh wow, it’s been a few months since the last time I blogged about going to open mics. I think it’s been about that long since I went to an open mic, which is sadder. It’s hard for me to balance going to the open mic, which I enjoy, and going to sleep early, which I enjoy <a href="do-versus-done.html">having done</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Still, when a friend said that they missed my presence at open mics<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, I decided it was time to dust<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> off my old<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> guitar.</p>
<p>It was hard for me to pick what I would play. For one, while I have been playing guitar, that has mostly meant doing some picking patterns, some scales, and a few songs that I don’t love singing along to in public.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> My staple open mic songs are all fairly stale, which also didn’t seem like an ideal situation. So, like all great folk musicians,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> I retuned my guitar to DADGAD.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> I’d been working on a Great Big Sea song<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> that’s in Celtic tuning<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>, and I felt like I probably knew a Stan Roger’s song<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> well enough to do them.</p>
<p>As it turns out, I knew the Great Big Sea song well enough, and I stumbled through the end of the Stan Rogers’<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> piece. Also I learned a fun fact! My throat feeling clogged before open mics is most likely a consequence of having brassicas<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> and not being nervous, as I had historically believed!</p>

<li id="fn1" role="doc-endnote"><p>wow look at that callback. I’m truly a master of the genre.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2" role="doc-endnote"><p>not in those exact words, but that is the interpretation I’m choosing to live with<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3" role="doc-endnote"><p>metaphorically. I had literally played it at Mass that night and was practicing at least a few times a week before that<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4" role="doc-endnote"><p>it’s not really. I got it around a year ago, since I wanted an acoustic guitar that A: was in tune and B: had an amp hookup.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5" role="doc-endnote"><p>mostly because I still don’t know Fisherman’s Wharf (the song I play the most) well enough to want to share it with others<a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6" role="doc-endnote"><p>I’m not one, and it’s almost certainly overly reductive to say they all did this. I do know that Stan Rogers was encouraged to do this, though, so I assume others were as well<a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7" role="doc-endnote"><p>I.e. bottom, top, and second from the top strings all tuned down one step.<a href="#fnref7" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
