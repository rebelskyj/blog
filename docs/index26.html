<p>As each month slowly passes by, I find that I will think in rhymes and rhythms that obey the poems I should ink. And so today I thought I’d try to write a post like that. But wow, it’s hard conveying thoughts when each beat has a place.</p>

<p>Jeremiah 17:7: “ Blessed are those who trust in the LORD; the LORD will be their trust”</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today’s readings speak about trusting the Lord, for better and for worse. Should we trust in the Lord, we are told that we will be cared for in times of sorrow. However, we are also told that those times of sorrow will come If we are weeping now, laughter will come to us.<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> If we are laughing now, however, we will weep later.<a href="#fn022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Now, this isn’t to say that we should be in a perpetual state of weeping, with hopes that our joy will come later.<a href="#fn023" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Rather, we are to remember that the good in our lives will comes to an end, just as the bad will.</p>

<p>Today was the second and final day of the Conference Championship diving meet. I placed fourth. I threw my 203a for the first time, and it went pretty well. All in all, it was a fun season.</p>

<p>Today was my last practice before Conference. My coach decided it would be a really short practice. Hopefully I do well tomorrow.</p>

<p>Isaiah 6:8: “Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, ‘Whom shall I send? Who will go for us?’ ‘Here I am,’ I said; ‘send me!’”</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today’s readings speak about the nature of God’s relationship with us. As Isaiah was, we are to be awed and fearing.<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> As Simon was, we are to be unquestioning,<a href="#fn092" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> and again, fearful.<a href="#fn093" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>But this is not all that the relationship is. For just after Isaiah speaks about his unworthiness, he is made pure.<a href="#fn094" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> And when Simon and his partners too followed God, they are exhorted, “Do not be afraid; from now on you will be catching men.”<a href="#fn095" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> All in all, that’s nice to think about. We can trust wholly in the Lord our God, and he will make us pure and worthy.</p>
