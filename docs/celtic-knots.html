<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As I’ve mentioned <a href="celtic-crochet.html">before</a>, I like crocheting Celtic knots. I also like drawing them. One issue I often have with them, though, is that extant knotwork often has motifs other than just an interwoven strand.</p>
<p>A very common motif is some sort of animal shape, which I’ve always struggled to draw. So, recently I decided it would be fun to learn how to draw a dragon,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> so that I could make better<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> knotwork.</p>
<p>It went really slowly at first. Every dragon I drew looked somewhat goofy, which I only realized later was because of a lack of details.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Eventually I figured out how to draw nice<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> dragon heads, and even made a convincing knot or two with them. Then I decided to learn to draw wings, for some reason.</p>
<p>I’ve always struggled with wings, probably because of the inherent need for a 3D perspective. For whatever reason, though, this time I drew good enough wings within like 15 minutes of trying, which is fun. Anyways, I’m enjoying the Celtic knot resurgence in my life.</p>
