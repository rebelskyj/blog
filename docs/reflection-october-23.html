<p>First Written: 2023 October 3</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Shoot, somehow it’s the end of October. I really feel like I blinked and suddenly the month has completely vanished.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Despite the fact that this month is gone without any blog postings, I still managed to keep up my five a days.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> As a result, I can still give some highlights for the month.</p>
<p>This past month I:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Went to a fancy PChem banquet in the department</p></li>
<li><p>Gave my last planned talks for a while!</p></li>
<li><p>Talked to children!<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Met with a high school friend</p></li>
<li><p>Visited home</p></li>
<li><p>Made ravioli</p></li>
<li><p>Went to Rocky Horror Picture Show!<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Went diving for the first time in ages!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s see how that lines up with my things I was excited for from last month’s reflection.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I have a friend staying with me! That’s always exciting.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I’m giving two real talks this week!<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>There’s a cool dinner tomorrow I get to go to<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I’m going to a school to talk to the kids about careers in STEM!<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I’m going to a science fair next week!<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Hey, that’s pretty close to overlap. As always, there are new and exciting things that I did not know I was going to do at the start of the month. I also set my standards incredibly low, which made it easy for the lists to overlap. Let’s see how we did against last month’s goals, though.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Blog more. I somehow blogged less.</p></li>
<li><p>Get ahead on Jeb. I am planning to write another chapter of Jeb right after I write this post, which will technically be slightly ahead.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep my home clean. My home is about as clean now as it was at the start of the month, which is nice. It fell apart in the middle, but I got it back.</p></li>
<li><p>Pray better. I’ve started doing a daily rosary before bed, which is, at the very least, more prayer.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch more. I stretched a total of five times, compared to 6 in September. Whoops.</p></li>
<li><p>Get back into writing letters to friends. I wrote not a single letter. I didn’t even address a letter wow.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So, as expected, I did not do a great job on my goals. But, there’s always the future to improve, and that’s what my goal is now. Next month, I’m excited for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Going home for Thanksgiving</p></li>
<li><p>Doing NaNoWriMo with a friend</p></li>
<li><p>I’m guest teaching a class, which is fun.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I’m going to a cool discussion about Pascal.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once again, a fairly small list, though one that’s spaced a little more over the month, which is probably good for me. Goals for the upcoming month:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Write 1700 words a day for my NaNo project. I averaged more than this last year, and I think that I can do it fairly quickly, especially since I even plotted this novel.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Write a chapter of Jeb every day. So, this is such an outlandish goal, except that I don’t do as many social activities anymore, and I will already be in the swing of writing for NaNoWriMo. If I cut myself off from writing too much more than 1700 words a day for that, the extra creative juice will have to flow somewhere, and it may as well be into Jeb.</p></li>
<li><p>Blog every day. Now, lots of people say that the correct way to build a habit is by picking a single incremental change to your life and implementing it. They’re probably right. Nonetheless, I want to do my best here, rather than simply doing something. I very often have monthly goals of writing more blog posts, and this month I will already have the daily momentum of Jeb and NaNo to keep me blogging.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch every day. There is really nothing about my life that is not improved when I stretch more. Given that I will be hunched over a computer more this upcoming month<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a>, it is almost certainly going to be necessary for me to at least stretch my neck, shoulders, and hands. Also, there’s now a club diving team at my school, so I can go diving again. My body was not flexible enough for it last time, but that’s only more reason for me to improve.</p></li>
<li><p>Improve the cleanliness of my home. Last month I raised my standards for what my home should be like. I would like to do that again.</p></li>
<li><p>Pray better. I have gotten to the point that a daily rosary is what I do, but it’s not always<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> particularly mindful. At a minimum, it would be good for me to be better about that.</p></li>
<li><p>Write letters to friends. At a minimum, there are three people I owe a letter to and at least one other person I would like to send a letter to. We’re almost at the time of year that holiday cards become appropriate, and I could consider doing those this year.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This means that I’ll have a daily reflection that looks like:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write 1700 words for NaNoWriMo? /1700</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch?</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing better at prayer than a rushed and thoughtless rosary?</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing a good job writing letters to friends?</p></li>
</ul>
