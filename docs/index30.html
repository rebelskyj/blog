<p>First Published: 2022 January 26</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As I mentioned yesterday, I’m currently writing a piece which could be described as aleatoric lite music. More or less, my goal was to create a piece that can be continued for as long as needed. Then I decided to add constraints, because what’s the point of life without a little<a href="#fn001" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> chaos?</p>
<p>My first constraint was that I wanted it to be a round and/or canon melody.<a href="#fn002" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Those are fairly easy to write, as it turns out, so that was great to learn.</p>
<p>My second constraint changed. Initially, I wanted to have each voice have the melody, writing four part voice leading to make that fit. However, the issue with that is that then you functionally have to write four different parts. So, I decided that I would add a new constraint: there would be one harmony set, and the voices would trade to produce the different arrangements for voices. I’m still unsure between my current plan of having 4 voicings and having 12, but since the tenor<a href="#fn003" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> line and the bass line as melody currently are the same basically, I’m not sure what difference the audience might hear between the two options. Though, as I write this I realize that one of the goals was to keep it musically interesting moreso for the performers than for the crowd, so I guess the 12 options is more fun.</p>
<p>A new idea that’s come to me since writing this blog is to have non-even loop lengths. In all honesty, that should have been my first idea for aleatoric music. The general idea behind the concept is that you have, for instance, a three beat line, a four beat line, and a five beat line. If you start them all together and then let it run, with each voice looping as soon as it finishes, you end up with 4*3*5 =60 beats. From 12 beats of written music, that isn’t so bad. Of course, that scales really well. If you write a 12 beat and a 13 beat part, for instance, those 25 beats you’ve written generate 156 distinct beats. A 13,14, and 15 beat part gives you 2370 beats of music for 42 beats of writing. The issue for me is that generally if you want these beats to sound good, you’re pretty limited to a single chord, though I guess it isn’t at all uncommon to have them in the same diatonic world. Once I finish the four part writing, I might try generating something that doesn’t evenly go into 32<a href="#fn004" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>, and see if maybe that sounds nice. The biggest issue there is that timing becomes harder, because unless you copy paste the same melody line over and over, people tend not to like phasing. I guess I’ll check with the conductress and see if she has any thoughts on the looping idea. Maybe she’ll like it, though I really doubt it.</p>
<p>Anyways, I’ve got the first two measures of the four part harmony written, and the whole canon is finished as well. At this rate I should be finished by the end of the week, but that’s a dangerous thing to claim.</p>

<p>First Published: 2022 January 25</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today is the first day of my new Spring semester. It was a fun day!</p>
<p>Out of the blue, I happened to see someone I care deeply about. I got to write a letter to that same person, which was claimed to be appreciated. I got a letter in turn from the exact same person!<a href="#fn011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> In my choir class I got to see a bunch of friends from last semester. In the same choir class, I got to see<a href="#fn012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> the new music that I’m going to be singing this semester, and found out that we’re performing at an early music festival<a href="#fn013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, which is incredibly fun and exciting. My ISM class<a href="#fn014" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> met, and I’m learning interesting things in it/sure I’ll learn many more.</p>
<p>On the research side, a piece I needed machined in the shop was finished, so I got to spend some time playing with electronic-adjacent pieces<a href="#fn015" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. I got to see my group and have long and productive conversations with them all about research.</p>
<p>In productivity, I got through more of my items today than I did yesterday, which is incredible and a little bit disappointing in how I did yesterday. I started a massive revision of a small choral piece I’m working on, which<a href="#fn016" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> I will write about below.</p>
<p>The piece is designed to be performed during the Ash Wednesday ashing<a href="#fn017" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>. As a result, I want to have a piece which can be performed for some arbitrary amount of time, so that everyone who wants ashes can do so to the music, without it necessarily needing to repeat in a perfect loop. The easiest answer to that problem is to simply have aleatoric music, but simple answers aren’t always good answers. The biggest problem with aleatoric music is that I am almost positive the performers would hate it.</p>
<p>So, we then move to aleatoric music lite. My goal is a four part melody that can be sung as a round or as four part harmony, where each of the four voices can take each of the four parts. I am not going to be so extra so as to plan for the whole 4 factorial<a href="#fn018" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> combinations possible, especially because most of them should be the same-ish sounding. There are some problems with that, however. The biggest problem is that there is a very small range that<a href="#fn019" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> can be sung by all four voice parts. After that, figuring out the rules for inverting counterpoint are relatively easier.<a href="#fn0110" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> In the choir I’m writing for, the range I think that I can have all four parts sing is G-G<a href="#fn0111" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>. Since it’s for Ash Wednesday, I want a sad tune, and since it’s liturgical adjacent I would like something modal. As a result, the piece is in Phrygian.<a href="#fn0112" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Without this footer I’m at 461 no footnotes and 77 footnote words, which meets my goal. Maybe tomorrow I should keep writing about this, since it seems to be easy to come out</p>

<p>There are days of my life which seem to fly by, filled with joy and productivity. There are days of my life where I feel sick, and feel myself recover, even though nothing major happens. And, there are days like today, where everything just feels slightly off. I’m hopeful that this time tomorrow I’ll feel like my normal, energized self again.</p>
<p>It’s the first day of classes, which is exciting and fun. It’s the second to last day that my upperclassman is in town for a while, which is sad. It’s<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> the first day in a while I’ll get to leave a like letter. So, I really hope that I wake up tomorrow filled with joy and excitement for the day.</p>
<p>At the very least, I’d love to feel something. Today is one of those days where all I really feel is exhausted, which is sad since I did next to nothing today.</p>
<p>This is only one hundred and sixty<a href="#fn022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> words, which is nowhere near my goal. I wish I cared enough to keep going.</p>

<h1 id="reflections-on-todays-gospel"><a href="reflections-on-readings-3-ordinary-c-2022.html">Reflections on Today’s Gospel</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 January 23</p>
<p>Nehemiah 8:8: “Ezra read clearly from the book of the law of God, interpreting it so that all could understand what was read.”</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>According to the priest at Mass tonight, today is the celebration of the Word of G-d. If that’s the case, then the readings are especially appropriate. The first reading has Ezra reading the Lord’s word to the people of Israel. The Gospel has the Word made Flesh in the person of Jesus Christ reading the prophecy that he himself fulfilled.</p>
<p>There’s something beautiful about that to me. It’s really fantastic to see how so much of the bible is mirrored between the Old and New Testaments. Last time I heard these readings, I thought of them as <a href="reflections-on-readings-3-ordinary-c.html">“one of the more straightforward Gospels”</a> It’s so weird to me how these readings used to seem plain and simple. Looking at them now, they seem incredibly deep, more-so to me at least than a lot of weeks.</p>
<p>The second reading in particular is something I feel that I should read more often. It reminds me of a quote from<a href="#fn031" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> St. Therese of Lisieux which says something along the lines that a garden of nothing but roses is not more beautiful than a garden with all the flowers of nature, and a daisy is not made better by being a rose. There’s no part of me that was not lovingly fashioned by the Lord and Creator of all things, and I need to remember that more in my day to day life. We are not unloved beings in an uncaring universe, but deeply loved and beloved beings made in the image of the Lord, who is Love.</p>

<h1 id="on-villanelles"><a href="on-villanelles.html">On Villanelles</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 January 22</p>
<p>Prereading note: I’ve decided I’m going to try to shoot for 500<a href="#fn041" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> words a post from now on so that I know what 1000 words feels like.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today as I pulled up my text editor to work on the blog post, I realized that I was about to hit writer’s block. That is, I could not think of anything to write today. Thankfully, old Jonathan knew this day might one day arise, and helpfully <a href="restarting.html">gave me some ideas.</a><a href="#fn042" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> One of them was to write about my newfound enjoyment of villanelles.</p>
<p>I’ve written before<a href="#fn043" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> about how, among my many goals for self-enrichment, I have had a goal to write more poetry. When I began this blog, probably due to my location, I focused on sonnets. For whatever reason, sonnets don’t really speak to my soul the way other forms do. I just cannot connect to pentameter.</p>
<p>That being said, one thing that I loved about sonnets is their constraint. I found that having the very restrictive rhyme and rhythm helped me not only to write them, which was the first-level goal of my doing so, but also to write better outside of poetry, because I became more aware of cadence. When I wanted to restart writing poetry again, therefore, I thought it might be helpful to find another constrained pattern for writing.</p>
<p>I don’t know if you’ve ever tried searching the internet for a list of poetic forms and how they work, but I could not find a good list. So, I used my brain and thought about who in my life might have a list of poetic forms easily at hand. And so, I messaged one of my close friends, who was an English major.<a href="#fn044" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> She pointed me to the villanelle, which is constrained in a very odd way.</p>
<p>A villanelle is a nineteen line poem, comprised of six stanzas. Five of the stanzas contain three lines, and the sixth contains four. The second lines of each of the stanzas rhyme with each other, which is fairly normal. The odd constraint comes with the interplay of the first stanza and the last line<a href="#fn045" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> of each remaining stanza. The first line of the first stanza is the third line of the second, fourth, and sixth stanza of the villanelle. The last line of the first stanza is the last line of the third, fifth, and sixth stanza. And, the first line of each of the remaining stanzas must also rhyme with these lines.</p>
<p>As a result, you technically only need to write thirteen lines to fill a villanelle. But, the repetition of the lines means that you need to think about how each line can serve multiple story elements. The most famous example<a href="#fn046" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> of <a href="https://poets.org/poem/do-not-go-gentle-good-night">“Do Not Go Gentle into the Good Night”</a> by Dylan Thomas.</p>
<p>Writing them has been really illuminating for me, because it has really forced me to improve a skill that I previously had left fairly undeveloped: revising and editing a poem. Villanelles almost require revision, because I at least will often realize that the rhyme I chose is too constrictive, or the line isn’t evocative enough. That being said, the cadence of a villanelle is incredibly moving to me, so I hope that I’ll keep writing them.</p>
<p>Not counting this text: 545 words outside footnotes, 58 with footnotes.</p>

<h1 id="losing-my-marbles"><a href="losing-marbles.html">Losing My Marbles</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 January 21</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Sometimes there are perfect storms in my life, where multiple, seemingly unrelated events conspire to cause something to occur to my mind. Today I got to experience one again! As always, I’m very excited by the concept of metacognition.</p>
<p>First, the background. I’m reading a book called “Don’t Teach Coding (Until You Read This Book)”, a book about teaching computer science targeted to secondary and below teachers, many of whom do not have formal training in computer science themselves. Rather than being a manual of how to learn Java<a href="#fn051" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, the book<a href="#fn052" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> instead takes an incredibly high-level approach to computer science. It begins by defining computer science less as bits on the page and more as a formal language. Without continuing this digression, one important topic it mentions is the concept of extended memory.</p>
<p>Extended memory is a concept which more or less says that when you need to look at your phone to remember someone’s phone number, it’s not that you’ve forgotten it, it’s that your brain is using your phone as an external storage device for memory. I really like it as a concept, both because it appears consistent with scientific findings<a href="#fn053" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, but mostly because it is anti-Ludditical. One extended memory I’ve been using since I started this blog<a href="#fn054" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> is a series of journals.</p>
<p>If I remember correctly, I’m now on journal four, which was started November 24, 2019.<a href="#fn055" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Since switching many of my note-taking and artistic concepts to other media, I’ve struggled to find a use for the journal, which is a large reason why it’s lasted so long. As I’ve mentioned <a href="living-scheduled.html">a few</a> <a href="thinking-about-life.html">other times</a>, I’ve recently started bullet-journaling lite. It’s been really helpful when I decide to do it.</p>
<p>But, what happens when<a href="#fn056" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> I lose the journal itself. In searching for it, I realized that I would be out more than the pages of writings and art that I’ve made, but also my ability to keep organized. I don’t really have a good solution to that, but it made me think about my reliance on this medium. Hopefully over time I will need it less, but I’m not really thinking that’s likely.</p>

<p>Ideally, I would rather that the creation be something physical, though that bias may come from other sources,<a href="#fn094" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> but I’m not including it because I’m still working through how I feel about it.</p>
<p>Now I guess I should support the claim. Disclaimer for readers<a href="#fn095" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>, I’m going to be entering into a lot of speculative theology here, please feel free to correct me if I am in error anywhere. In the beginning of the Bible, we see the Lord make man in His image. There are<a href="#fn096" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> countless tomes written about what it means that man exists in the image of the Most High. Today, I’d like to posit that a<a href="#fn097" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> way we are like Him is in our inherent drive to creation.</p>
<p>Before He creates man, the Lord begins by creating the universe. He creates all the living things which populate the earth, the stars in their courses, and the laws which govern nature. And it is all beautiful.</p>
<p>While we cannot create planets and stars, we can still create beauty, and so show ourselves in reflection of the Almighty. Now we must move a few verses ahead to the creation of man. The Lord makes man for<a href="#fn098" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> at least<a href="#fn099" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> one reason, to share in the beauty of His creation. So too, we act in the likeness of the Lord when we share things we have created with each other.</p>
<p>Moving from the Genesis/religious argument, I think hobbies which create have an inherent goodness to them due to their adding of the sum beauty in the world. The worst written poem still has some joy within it, and a burnt pie may still taste ok.<a href="#fn0910" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Too, giving to others means that you don’t end up creating only for yourself, as our lives aren’t meant for ourselves. We’re meant to share all that we are to lead all people to the Lord.<a href="#fn0911" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Our Lord is the G-d of beauty and of love, and so any time we help people to experience either we are helping them to know the Most High.</p>
<p>I guess I should give examples of creation-hobbies. There are the obvious ones in hobbies which create<a href="#fn0912" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> permanent physical goods such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Woodworking</p></li>
<li><p>Crochet</p></li>
<li><p>Knitting</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are hobbies which create<a href="#fn0913" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> impermanent physical goods such a:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cooking</p></li>
<li><p>Soap making</p></li>
<li><p>Baking</p></li>
</ul>
<p>And there are hobbies which create intangibles, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Writing</p></li>
<li><p>Drawing</p></li>
<li><p>Music</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To me, all of these are creation-hobbies. Obviously, this is a non-exhaustive list, and I would not even stake a claim that my three categories are themselves exhaustive. But, in the first category, you can create goods which others look at time and time again, reminding them that they are loved each time they do. The second, though transient, can show that you were thinking of them and, in the first and third, share the most vital of human connections, food. The third shares our mind and heart with others in the most direct way, which can make it the hardest to truly share. But, all of them are wonderful and I obviously think sharing and creating more beauty is a good thing</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>I recently read a post that claimed everyone should have at least one hobby which creates. Something about that really stuck with me over the past week or so, and I’m using today’s post to try to explore why.<a href="#fn0914" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>First, I guess I should give the claim. I believe that every person should have at least one hobby which involves two<a href="#fn0915" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> components:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Creating something</p></li>
<li><p>Sharing that creation with other people</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Ideally, I would rather that the creation be something physical, though that bias may come from other sources,<a href="#fn0916" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> but I’m not including it because I’m still working through how I feel about it.</p>
<p>Now I guess I should support the claim. Disclaimer for readers<a href="#fn0917" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>, I’m going to be entering into a lot of speculative theology here, please feel free to correct me if I am in error anywhere.
