<p>First Published: 2023 November 1</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Well, it‚Äôs another November, which means it‚Äôs time for another installment in ‚ÄúI<a href="#fn001" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> try my hardest to drive myself insane by doing something related to NaNoWriMo again.‚Äù In 2018, when I began this blog<a href="#fn002" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, I did not have the drive to actually write a novel. Instead, I <a href="nanowrimo.html">attempted to add fifty thousand words to my ‚Äôblog postings over the course of the month.</a> As I am sure you<a href="#fn003" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> can guess, I was unsuccessful at that mission.</p>
<p>By 2019, I had forgotten about my musings well before November rolled around. 2020 and 2021 likewise passed by me without anything to point at.<a href="#fn004" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> I suppose that there may not actually be all that much from 2021, given that I worked on the same journal from November of 2019<a href="#fn005" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> through August of last year.</p>
<p>Last year, as I certainly remember, I <a href="nanowrimo-2.html">attempted to do NaNoWriMo</a> for what I had a vague idea was my first time ever. As it turns out, I had made an account back in 2011, and had attempted to do NaNoWriMo that year. I, unsurprisingly, failed at that goal.</p>
<p>Last year, however, I was successful, at least in terms of writing 50000 words of fiction and finishing one narrative. The two did not align with each other, as I needed to start a sequel in order to get to the needed word count. Of course, I gave up on the story almost as soon as I could. One year later, I have no interest in revisiting that story.</p>
<p>I also wrote a story this past April, as part of a writing competition for the website where I currently post my ongoing novel.<a href="#fn006" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> I made it to the word count for that book<a href="#fn007" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>, but was tired of writing it by the end of the word count and rushed the ending.</p>
<p>Well, rushed may be a bit of an understatement. The book was set over the course of twelve years. I spent all but fifteen hundred of the words on the first three weeks, then rushed through the next twelve years in the remaining word count. One commenter‚Äôs reply was that they were grateful that I did not leave the work unfinished, for all that the ending was incredibly unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>So, that brings us to November. As I mentioned <a href="reflection-october-23.html">yesterday</a>, I am also trying to revive this ‚Äôblog and get further ahead in my other book at the same time. Will it work?</p>
<p>Who knows.</p>
<p>Will I burn out before the month is done?</p>
<p>Almost certainly.</p>
<p>Am I still going to ride this train for as long as I can, in hopes that I might be able to salvage a number of words from the situation?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Anyways, the book this year is something I‚Äôve never tried before. I realize I‚Äôve only really written third person limited in the past, so I‚Äôm writing this book in first person. Now, whether that‚Äôs going to be a good idea is yet to be determined.</p>
<p>The general plot of the book is that there‚Äôs an order of vampire fighting werewolf priests in the modern day United States.<a href="#fn008" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> I‚Äôm not sure how much of the balance I‚Äôll have between conversation and action, but given that I‚Äôve spent all of today‚Äôs content<a href="#fn009" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> on the main character getting ready to meet with the monastery, odds are good that this book will also end up somewhat rushed.</p>
<p>In any case, it‚Äôll be the book I try to write.s I‚Äôm hopeful that I can tell a story, and a story with faith, since I haven‚Äôt really touched my faith in any of the writing I‚Äôve done.<a href="#fn0010" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be able to do it to anyone‚Äôs satisfaction, let alone my own, but I have been thinking a fair amount about how to interface my faith and writing.</p>
<p>I feel like that topic deserves far more consideration than I can give it at this point in the night.<a href="#fn0011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> It‚Äôs currently past my bedtime, and I‚Äôm well above my word goal for the day.<a href="#fn0012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write 1700 words for NaNoWriMo? Yes! I did two fifteen minute sprints<a href="#fn0013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>, 1798/1700. Nice I am 100 words ahead of schedule now.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb? I did! I just finished it, and, as seems always true, it felt much harder to write the chapter at the beginning<a href="#fn0014" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> than it ended up being.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? I am blogging now! Currently working on a streak, which is nice.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? Shoot! I will do that as soon as I finish here</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing better at prayer than a rushed and thoughtless rosary? I remembered to do an<a href="#fn0015" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> Angelus just before noon, when my alarm went off. Otherwise, I tried to be more mindful about my prayer last night, for all that I don‚Äôt know if it really was.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing a good job writing letters to friends? I found my stamps, envelopes, and cards. I also addressed an envelope. That feels like enough for the day, especially since I want to make the letters feel as easy as possible. Tomorrow I‚Äôll try to address another letter, but we‚Äôll see how I‚Äôm doing on time.</p></li>

<h1 id="monthly-reflection"><a href="reflection-october-23.html">Monthly Reflection</a></h1>
<p>First Written: 2023 October 3</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Shoot, somehow it‚Äôs the end of October. I really feel like I blinked and suddenly the month has completely vanished.<a href="#fn011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Despite the fact that this month is gone without any blog postings, I still managed to keep up my five a days.<a href="#fn012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> As a result, I can still give some highlights for the month.</p>
<p>This past month I:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Went to a fancy PChem banquet in the department</p></li>
<li><p>Gave my last planned talks for a while!</p></li>
<li><p>Talked to children!<a href="#fn014" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Met with a high school friend</p></li>
<li><p>Visited home</p></li>
<li><p>Made ravioli</p></li>
<li><p>Went to Rocky Horror Picture Show!<a href="#fn015" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Went diving for the first time in ages!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let‚Äôs see how that lines up with my things I was excited for from last month‚Äôs reflection.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I have a friend staying with me! That‚Äôs always exciting.<a href="#fn016" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I‚Äôm giving two real talks this week!<a href="#fn017" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>There‚Äôs a cool dinner tomorrow I get to go to<a href="#fn018" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I‚Äôm going to a school to talk to the kids about careers in STEM!<a href="#fn019" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I‚Äôm going to a science fair next week!<a href="#fn0110" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Hey, that‚Äôs pretty close to overlap. As always, there are new and exciting things that I did not know I was going to do at the start of the month. I also set my standards incredibly low, which made it easy for the lists to overlap. Let‚Äôs see how we did against last month‚Äôs goals, though.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Blog more. I somehow blogged less.</p></li>
<li><p>Get ahead on Jeb. I am planning to write another chapter of Jeb right after I write this post, which will technically be slightly ahead.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep my home clean. My home is about as clean now as it was at the start of the month, which is nice. It fell apart in the middle, but I got it back.</p></li>
<li><p>Pray better. I‚Äôve started doing a daily rosary before bed, which is, at the very least, more prayer.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch more. I stretched a total of five times, compared to 6 in September. Whoops.</p></li>
<li><p>Get back into writing letters to friends. I wrote not a single letter. I didn‚Äôt even address a letter wow.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So, as expected, I did not do a great job on my goals. But, there‚Äôs always the future to improve, and that‚Äôs what my goal is now. Next month, I‚Äôm excited for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Going home for Thanksgiving</p></li>
<li><p>Doing NaNoWriMo with a friend</p></li>
<li><p>I‚Äôm guest teaching a class, which is fun.<a href="#fn0111" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I‚Äôm going to a cool discussion about Pascal.<a href="#fn0112" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once again, a fairly small list, though one that‚Äôs spaced a little more over the month, which is probably good for me. Goals for the upcoming month:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Write 1700 words a day for my NaNo project. I averaged more than this last year, and I think that I can do it fairly quickly, especially since I even plotted this novel.<a href="#fn0113" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Write a chapter of Jeb every day. So, this is such an outlandish goal, except that I don‚Äôt do as many social activities anymore, and I will already be in the swing of writing for NaNoWriMo. If I cut myself off from writing too much more than 1700 words a day for that, the extra creative juice will have to flow somewhere, and it may as well be into Jeb.</p></li>
<li><p>Blog every day. Now, lots of people say that the correct way to build a habit is by picking a single incremental change to your life and implementing it. They‚Äôre probably right. Nonetheless, I want to do my best here, rather than simply doing something. I very often have monthly goals of writing more blog posts, and this month I will already have the daily momentum of Jeb and NaNo to keep me blogging.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch every day. There is really nothing about my life that is not improved when I stretch more. Given that I will be hunched over a computer more this upcoming month<a href="#fn0114" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>, it is almost certainly going to be necessary for me to at least stretch my neck, shoulders, and hands. Also, there‚Äôs now a club diving team at my school, so I can go diving again. My body was not flexible enough for it last time, but that‚Äôs only more reason for me to improve.</p></li>
<li><p>Improve the cleanliness of my home. Last month I raised my standards for what my home should be like. I would like to do that again.</p></li>
<li><p>Pray better. I have gotten to the point that a daily rosary is what I do, but it‚Äôs not always<a href="#fn0115" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> particularly mindful. At a minimum, it would be good for me to be better about that.</p></li>
<li><p>Write letters to friends. At a minimum, there are three people I owe a letter to and at least one other person I would like to send a letter to. We‚Äôre almost at the time of year that holiday cards become appropriate, and I could consider doing those this year.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This means that I‚Äôll have a daily reflection that looks like:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write 1700 words for NaNoWriMo? /1700</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch?</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing better at prayer than a rushed and thoughtless rosary?</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing a good job writing letters to friends?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>First Written: 2023 October 1 First Published: 2023 October 31<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Well, another month as flown by, carried away on the wings of time.<a href="#fn022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> As you<a href="#fn023" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> can tell from the lack of posts lately,<a href="#fn024" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> there are many updates since the last time I talked.</p>
<p>In short, I:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Bound a book with friends!<a href="#fn025" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Made cookies in lab<a href="#fn026" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Did not win a pinball tournament</p></li>
<li><p>Learned blender<a href="#fn027" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Did a graduate recruiting event/weekend</p></li>
<li><p>Went to a workshop on how to effectively give and receive feedback<a href="#fn028" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Had a poker night with friends.</p></li>
<li><p>Saw the relic of St. Jude.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let‚Äôs see once again how that compares to the list that I tried to make about things I was excited for this month.<a href="#fn029" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Running more than five miles again!<a href="#fn0210" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Swimming with friends!<a href="#fn0211" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Giving my final talk in the parks for the season<a href="#fn0212" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Coincidentally, this is also the final of the talk series for any speaker.</p></li>
<li><p>Recording a song!</p></li>
<li><p>Being ready for my upcoming talks</p></li>
<li><p>Maybe<a href="#fn0213" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> give or at least hash out details for me to give my first invited talk at a college I do not attend.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Oof ok. So, I did do the first three of those, but I had already done them by the last reflection. I did not record a song, which is a bit of a shame. As you might guess from the lack of postings lately, last month was not a good month for me in many regards.<a href="#fn0214" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>I‚Äôm mostly ready for my upcoming talks, though that‚Äôs a brand new development. Yesterday I gave a practice version of the talks to my groupmates, who resoundingly hated the talk. In their defense, I agree with absolutely all of their comments. They mostly boiled down to the fact that a public presentation should be a story that‚Äôs somewhat educational. Instead, all that I had was a list of facts.</p>
<p>As a result, I more or less restarted, this time much more focused on collecting pretty images than anything like having a coherent set of facts. After all, it‚Äôs far easier to make a coherent set of facts when you have a story than it is to make a story from a set of facts. I don‚Äôt think that I have quite enough content yet, though, so I‚Äôll need to think about other ways that I can pad the content. One option is obviously just to add in some more specific facts about what the different kinds of months are?<a href="#fn0215" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>I started hashing out the planning for the talk I‚Äôm giving at a real school. It‚Äôs for sure happening, which is really nice. I even have a date<a href="#fn0216" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> nailed down, which is great. Other than that, I vaguely know what I‚Äôm going to talk about.</p>
<p>So, what am I excited for this month?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I have a friend staying with me! That‚Äôs always exciting</p></li>
<li><p>I‚Äôm giving two real talks this week!<a href="#fn0217" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>There‚Äôs a cool dinner tomorrow I get to go to</p></li>
<li><p>I‚Äôm going to a school to talk to the kids about careers in STEM!<a href="#fn0218" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I‚Äôm going to a science fair next week!<a href="#fn0219" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, it‚Äôs looking like it‚Äôll be a pretty calm month, which will be nice, especially with how hectic my summer was.<a href="#fn0220" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> I‚Äôm sure that I did a bad job with my goals last month, but let‚Äôs see just how bad.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Finish/make my talk on the eclipses. Hey nice! I did it.</p></li>
<li><p>Make my home clean again. Also did this. Well, at least I made half of my home really clean. It‚Äôs the half that anyone has a reason to see, which is good enough.</p></li>
<li><p>Blog more! Objectively, I failed at this goal.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch and exercise more. Technically I did this! I made it to the gym a couple of times with a friend.</p></li>
<li><p>As before, sleep enough, and try to prioritize sleeping earlier. I think I did this. It was hard, especially since I felt like I needed tons more sleep than I should.</p></li>
<li><p>As always, be more intentional about prayer. That was a mixed goal. I started to pray a rosary every night, which is nice. I‚Äôm not always praying it well, but that‚Äôs progress at least.</p></li>
<li><p>Actually get ahead on my book. Oof. Ok so I did plot out to the end of this arc, but I‚Äôm writing so far off of that plan. I‚Äôve been basically writing each chapter as I need it.</p></li>
<li><p>Write more poetry. I did not write any poetry.</p></li>
<li><p>Write or record a song. I don‚Äôt think that I did this.</p></li>
<li><p>Write five things I like about myself every day<a href="#fn0221" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>, three things I‚Äôm excited for, and ten things I‚Äôm grateful for. Well, I gave up on this quickly, but was then told it‚Äôs ok that i did.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Goals for this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Blog more. I feel like this is self explanatory</p></li>
<li><p>Get ahead on Jeb. As above.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep my home clean. I like how it looks right now and I like that I can do things in it.</p></li>
<li><p>Pray better. I‚Äôll need to spend some time figuring out exactly what this means.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch more. I need to start taking care of myself.</p></li>
<li><p>Get back into writing letters to friends. I have fallen so hard off of this, and a lot of my friends deserve responses to their letters.</p></li>

<p>Today I had the opportunity to see the relic of St. Jude.<a href="#fn031" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> It was a beautiful experience, made more so by the fact that I got to sing at a Mass led by the Bishop.<a href="#fn032" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Unfortunately, that did mean that it‚Äôs later now than I‚Äôd like it to be, and continuing to blog will take more time than I think that I want to spend.</p>

<h1 id="euchre-tournament"><a href="euchre-tournament.html">Euchre Tournament</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 September 13</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As I mentioned <a href="talk-planning-eclipse-1">yesterday</a>, I have done a number of things during my downtime from blogging. I‚Äôd say one of the most fun of them was going to a friend‚Äôs euchre tournament last Saturday.<a href="#fn041" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>I think that I knew how to play euchre before the tournament, though I‚Äôm not entirely sure if I ever actually did. For those who don‚Äôt already know what euchre is, it‚Äôs a trick taking game. As far as I‚Äôve ever played it, it has four players.<a href="#fn042" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> The deck is comprised of a standard deck of cards, though with only cards 9 and higher.</p>
<p>Each hand is played in the same way. The dealer passes out five cards to each player, then turns up the top card of the remainder. If someone wants that to be the trump suit, they tell the dealer to pick it up, at which point it becomes trump, and the dealer gets to replace any card in their hand with it.<a href="#fn043" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> From there, the person to the dealer‚Äôs left leads with the first trick. If no one tells the dealer to pick it up, the card is discarded and everyone once more goes around and can choose to pick trump. If no one does the second time through, there</p>
<p>Points are scored at the end of each hand. If your team<a href="#fn044" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> took a majority of the tricks<a href="#fn045" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>, you get a point. You get another point for taking all five tricks, and another if the other team called trump. I‚Äôm told there‚Äôs also a benefit if you choose to go alone, though that was banned at the tournament I went to.</p>
<p>For those who‚Äôve never played a trick taking game, the general rules are that high cards win a trick. Each trick‚Äôs suit is the suit that the first player led with<a href="#fn046" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>. However, the trump suit always beats any other suit.</p>
<p>In euchre, you are mandated to play in suit if you can, including if you have trump in your hand. That‚Äôs an interesting variation, and one that I‚Äôll have to consider more as I keep playing it. I‚Äôm sure that it does things to the strategy that I did not immediately think about.</p>
<p>Euchre also introduces an interesting variation on trump, where the Jack of trump suit becomes the highest value card. The second highest value card is the jack of the other same colored suit.<a href="#fn047" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn048" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> After that, trump goes down ace, king, queen, 10, 9. It‚Äôs kind of fun that jack goes from being a middling card to the best one if and only if the suit is trump. I‚Äôm not sure how that impacts when you should have the dealer pick up the card, but I am certain that it will.</p>
<p>Ok so, explanation of euchre out of the way, let‚Äôs talk about the tournament. Of the twelve participants, three had played before, and I vaguely knew the rules of trick taking games. I ended up on a team with one of my group mates, and we got absolutely destroyed in the first game. I primarily blame luck for that, as it‚Äôs hard to win a game when you don‚Äôt have any trump cards in your hand.</p>
<p>The winning teams all rotated, and the second game began. Just as time was running out, we were down one point. I was dealer, and I gave myself<a href="#fn049" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> the ace, queen, and jack of spades, along with the jack of clubs. I also had the nine of clubs, but that doesn‚Äôt matter as much. What‚Äôs most important is that the card that declared suit was the king of spades.</p>
<p>Obviously, no one else wanted spades to be trump<a href="#fn0410" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> When the choice came to me, I, obviously, took it, and immediately declared that we had taken all five tricks as time was called for the game. That lucky streak remained in our next game, and we ended up winning 2/3 games, which put us in second place.<a href="#fn0411" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> It was a really fun time, and then the hosts took us to their back yard for a fire.</p>
<p>The fire was incredible, especially because they had some fancy fire pit with holes in the bottom, which means that the fire both never suffocated and also burned incredibly hot and fast. The fact that the wood was incredibly dry probably helped that, but it was mesmerizing to watch the flames.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I‚Äôm watching a blender tutorial after this, which is progress, if only meta.</p></li>
<li><p>I‚Äôm going to clean after the blender tutorial! That is some fighting against entropy.</p></li>
<li><p>Blogging streak is returning, which is great and fun and exciting and happy.</p></li>
<li><p>I actually did stretch, which is wild to me. It felt nice, but wow is my entire body stiff. I should stretch again tonight.</p></li>
<li><p>No exercise today, but I did walk, which is good.</p></li>
<li><p>I went to bed a little late last night, but set the alarm for much later.</p></li>
<li><p>I woke up before my alarm and everything!</p></li>
<li><p>I‚Äôm not sure that I‚Äôm not sick, so I stayed out of the chapel on purpose today.</p></li>
<li><p>If I write more Jeb today, which I plan to, I will be ahead, which is nice.</p></li>
<li><p>Book remains totally plotted, though I have been considering dropping the total number of chapters from 500 to 400 or even 300. At a rate of three chapters per day, there are a little under two and a half years left in the book. I would rather it be done before then, which either means I need to have fewer chapters or release them faster.<a href="#fn0412" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Every hundred chapters I drop is about two thirds of a year less, which is weird to think about.</p>
<p>In actual reasoning, though, I‚Äôm not sure if the third, fourth, and fifth sentences describing the book actually need and deserve their own total arcs.</p></li>
<li><p>No poetry, for all that I should.</p></li>
<li><p>Oh gosh, that‚Äôs something I keep forgetting to do. I will work on my album after cleaning and tutorial.</p></li>
<li><p>I just now wrote 5 things I like about myself.</p></li>
<li><p>I just now wrote three things I‚Äôm excited for.</p></li>
<li><p>As above, just wrote ten more things I‚Äôm grateful for.</p></li>
<li><p>I think that in general I‚Äôve been doing pretty well cultivating joy. I certainly am living more in the present, which is nice.</p></li>

<h1 id="talk-planning-eclipse"><a href="talk-planning-eclipse-1.html">Talk Planning (Eclipse)</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 September 12</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>First, sorry about the sudden radio silence. If I had to blame anything, I would blame the combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Getting suddenly busy<a href="#fn051" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="spoons-2">getting out of mental space</a>.<a href="#fn052" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Without further ado, though, I do have another talk in<a href="#fn053" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> just over three weeks. With twenty something days to go, it feels like an appropriate time to shift my planning from completely analog to something with a bit more structure. I‚Äôll be giving a talk on the eclipses that are coming up. I think I‚Äôve mentioned on here before<a href="#fn054" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>, but there are four upcoming eclipses on the continental US.<a href="#fn055" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> In order, these are a partial solar eclipse on October 14, a partial lunar eclipse on October 28, a penumbral lunar eclipse on March 25, and a total solar eclipse on April 8 (the first since 2017, and the last until<a href="#fn056" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> 2044).<a href="#fn057" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>There are a lot of ways that I could frame an eclipse talk. Having now talked to a number of people who have materials prepared, I realize that I don‚Äôt love most of the ways that they do. Being, as I am<a href="#fn058" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>, myself, the way that I‚Äôm choosing to frame the talk is by answering the following questions<a href="#fn059" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>What is an eclipse?<a href="#fn0510" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>How many kinds of eclipse are there?<a href="#fn0511" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Why do eclipses happen?<a href="#fn0512" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Why don‚Äôt eclipses happen?<a href="#fn0513" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>How do we know when eclipses will happen?<a href="#fn0514" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>So, really, only one of those questions actually requires any effort from me. My ‚ÄúWhat is an eclipse‚Äù slide<a href="#fn0515" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> will just be a picture of a pretty eclipse with the text definition of one. My ‚ÄúHow many kinds‚Äù slides or section will be a picture of each kind with a description of how they work.<a href="#fn0516" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> My ‚ÄúWhy do they happen‚Äù slide will just be ‚Äúwow we‚Äôre truly blessed.‚Äù My ‚ÄúHow do we know‚Äù is also pretty easy. Like, the answer is really just pattern matching,<a href="#fn0517" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> and the hardest part will be not going off on a rant about harmonics (see footnote).</p>
<p>Now, of course, you‚Äôll notice that I did not talk about ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt they happen?‚Äù. And that‚Äôs because the answer is really hard.</p>
<p>Ok, so, without graphics. The sun exists. That feels like a good place to start. Since we live in a vaguely heliocentric world<a href="#fn0518" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>, everything we care about exists in reference to the sun.</p>
<p>Now, we also know that there is an earth. The Earth, in fact.<a href="#fn0519" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> The Earth moves around the sun.</p>
<p>Now, there are some fun things about that. Imagine if the Earth didn‚Äôt rotate at all.<a href="#fn0520" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> We would have one day every year. That would be really bad, I think.<a href="#fn0521" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> Even worse, though, the Earth could be tidally locked, which would mean that, at least in respect to the sun, the earth never rotated. Ope, actually, since we‚Äôre saying that the sun is the point of reference, we can thankfully ignore the Earth being stationary from an above inertial reference frame.<a href="#fn0522" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Ok so we have the sun. The sun is orbited by the Earth. If the Earth was tidally locked<a href="#fn0523" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> we would have half the earth bathed in flame and half bathed in ice.<a href="#fn0524" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> Instead, we are lucky that the Earth rotates about four hundred times per rotation around the sun.<a href="#fn0525" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>Now, if the Earth rotated around the sun without a tilt, there would be no seasons.<a href="#fn0526" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> Of course, as we know, we have seasons, which means that we orbit at a tilt. That does then raise the question of what a day is. After all, if you‚Äôre on either of the poles, there would be entire calendar days with no apparent change in the location of the sun in the sky.<a href="#fn0527" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> Also, anywhere you are, a fun thing to do is to find that the sun sets later on the days following the longest day of the year than it did on that day. That‚Äôs because the day is more than 24 hours during that point. Oh cool, the length of a day can vary by as much as 8 seconds during the course of the earth‚Äôs orbit. Hmm, that doesn‚Äôt explain why sun sets later.</p>
<p>Oh gosh, it has to do with incident tilt of the earth and therefore apparent amounts of sunlight, along with the fact that the amount of sunshine we get is shifted slightly later, I guess. That is way more than I ever wanted to know and learn, at least for this talk, so I guess I have to leave out the fun fact about how the sun sets later.</p>
<p>Diversions aside, we now have the sun and the earth, which rotates at its tilt across the sun. It‚Äôs at this point I want to use blender to animate, because I do not want to hand animate this, and also my ability to animate in python is very limited.<a href="#fn0528" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> But, more importantly, we then add in the moon.</p>
<p>So, first of all, if the moon was the wrong angular size in the sky, we would have much different numbers of eclipses. Shoot, I‚Äôll have to discuss angular size here. Actually, is that the first place to go? I think that the first place I should do it is by going ‚Äúok so the moon is actually bound to the earth, rather than the sun, which feels weird.‚Äù</p>
<p>The moon is tidally locked to the earth, so we only see one face. If you think of it like a mirror, we can see a full moon when it‚Äôs opposite the earth from the sun, and we see a new moon when the moon is between the earth and the sun. This is where the question of why not all eclipses becomes relevant.</p>
<p>So first, we have size on sky. If moon big, more solar eclipses. If moon very big, no chance for total lunar.</p>
<p>But, of course, assumption will start with everything in the same plane, because of course it will. Instead, moon orbits earth at an angle. Because of that, we can only have the intersection at certain times of year. This is really what I want the animation for, because the two dimensional static drawings aren‚Äôt totally helpful.</p>
<p>Anyways, a friend also said that if I‚Äôm interested in public outreach generally, I should start a youtube channel and post my talks there. It‚Äôs not a bad idea, for all that I know it would make me incredibly neurotic.</p>

<li><p>This is progress!</p></li>
<li><p>Kind of fought entropy. I meal prepped this past Sunday, which also did a lot to give me food for the week.</p></li>

<li id="fn0511" role="doc-endnote"><p>ok so there‚Äôs solar and lunar, which is two. There‚Äôs partial and total, which applies to both, so four.

I don‚Äôt know if a partial penumbral eclipse is a meaningful kind, but I still see at least five kinds of eclipse when I quickly google (partial and total solar, partial, total, and penumbral lunar.<a href="#fn05ref11" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">‚Ü©Ô∏é</a></p></li>

<h1 id="universe-in-the-park-part-5"><a href="universe-5.html">Universe in the Park Part 5</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 September 4</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Well, first off, sorry for anyone who tried to read <a href="universe-4">my last post</a>. I apparently completely forgot how to do formatting. I don‚Äôt have the spoons<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> to fix it right now, but I will try my hardest to remember to do so in the future.</p>
<p>Unlike my last post, this reflection is only on a single Universe in the Park<a href="#fn062" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, rather than five. I think I said this yesterday, but it was not only my final talk of the summer, it was also the final talk of this program for the summer. It had good attendance, for all that the crowd wasn‚Äôt as great as I would‚Äôve loved. Most of the first few questions were just polite ways of asking ‚Äúright, but like, what‚Äôs the point?‚Äù Thankfully, there were three children there.<a href="#fn063" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> I can always rely on children to ask many and interesting<a href="#fn064" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> questions.</p>
<p>Some highlights from last night include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Do the stars we see at night move?<a href="#fn065" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Are there rocky planets other than the moon?<a href="#fn066" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Two versions of ‚Äúwhat color are planets?‚Äù</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As always, after the formal talk portion of the night, I tried to set up my telescope. It was looking cloudy beforehand, so I did not have any of the prep work done, but I thankfully was able to make quick work of it.<a href="#fn067" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> The moon was large and beautiful<a href="#fn068" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>, so I started pointing at it. Someone told me that Saturn was apparently visible, so I hesitantly pointed the telescope there next.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that Saturn was partially hidden behind a cloud, I think it was the coolest thing I‚Äôve pointed at this summer. The moon is great, but it mostly just looks like a higher definition image of the moon. Most stars just look like brighter dots on the sky. The occasional double is cool, but it‚Äôs just two close by dots. Saturn, on the other hand, had resolvable disks!<a href="#fn069" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>After that, I used my trusty star finding app to point me to a nice double given what part of the sky I could see.<a href="#fn0610" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> There was a nice double, and people seemed very<a href="#fn0611" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> excited to see it. After that, there were just a few stragglers, so I showed them Polaris<a href="#fn0612" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> and then not so subtly suggested that they should go home.</p>
<p>It did not feel like a good talk, but I got tons of compliments afterwards. In retrospect, I was in a really bad head space, and while I don‚Äôt think it negatively affected my talk too terribly much, I think it absolutely crushed my idea of how well the talk went. It was my tenth of the season and my I think twelfth overall.<a href="#fn0613" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> There are, as it turns out, sixty eight state parks in this state. Given the overlap and the fact that my first talk of the summer wasn‚Äôt at a state park<a href="#fn0614" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>, I have slim hopes of making it to all of them for a talk before I leave graduate school. Still, I can try my hardest I suppose.</p>
<p>The park as a whole was pretty beautiful. It was on one of the nice lakes<a href="#fn0615" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>, and it had dunes. I didn‚Äôt get in until lateish, and so I didn‚Äôt want to go swimming.<a href="#fn0616" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> I then left early in the morning because I had a fairly packed schedule that day.</p>
<p>Anyways, I had a lovely season of these talks, and I‚Äôm grateful for the chance to have done them.<a href="#fn0617" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>I made a little progress, in that I learned how to record an animation in blender.</p></li>
<li><p>I did not fight in the least against the entropy in my home.</p></li>
<li><p>I suppose I‚Äôm better, in that I did it again today.</p></li>
<li><p>I stretched a little while lifting, but only in so far as a low weight lift is a stretch.</p></li>
<li><p>I went lifting with a friend!</p></li>
<li><p>I did not prioritize sleep. Instead, I went to a friend‚Äôs party.</p></li>
<li><p>I woke like three hours earlier than I‚Äôd hoped. That is not a positive.</p></li>
<li><p>I am very tired, and so only spent five or so. It was still a great use of time, and I will make sure to do more tomorrow, especially since I can do it on the walk to work instead of on the way home from the gym</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote about four hundred words, which is a little less than I need if I write that much every day. That being said, I also have three days to write that chapter, so.</p></li>
<li><p>I plotted out<a href="#fn0618" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> the rest of the book.</p></li>
<li><p>I did not write poetry.</p></li>
<li><p>I jammed with a friend and shared the new song with him, so sure. I also realized that my installation of Musescore had broken, so I fixed that.</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote five things I like about myself.</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote three things I was excited to have done today.<a href="#fn0619" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I wrote ten things I‚Äôm grateful for.</p></li>
<li><p>I did not generally cultivate joy.</p></li>

<h1 id="monthly-reflection"><a href="reflection-august-23.html">Monthly Reflection</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 September 3</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>And, like sand through an hourglass, my own hours have passed silently by. Whoops, that‚Äôs a little maudlin. Let‚Äôs try opening again.</p>
<p>Like the moon which rises and falls each day, waxing and waning over the course of a month, my own month was filled with intermediate highs and lows.<a href="#fn071" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>August, like a summer‚Äôs day, felt so long in the moment and yet so short upon reflection.<a href="#fn072" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> I gave my <a href="universe-4.html">last</a> few<a href="#fn073" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> talks for the summer! I went to a concert!<a href="#fn074" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> I <a href="ms-holmes-ms-watson.hmtl">went to a play!</a></p>
<p>I turned <a href="twenty-five">twenty five</a>! I gave my accordion away to be repaired. I competed in a pinball tournament! I went to a friend‚Äôs thesis defense!</p>
<p>I wrote a few letters. I swam in a Great Lake!<a href="#fn075" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> I visited my family!</p>
<p>Ok, so in retrospect, I suppose that I did actually do a lot. It still doesn‚Äôt feel like it, but as they<a href="#fn076" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> say, c‚Äôest la vie.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs see how that list compares with what I said I was excited for.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>My birthday! Hey nice I did say that.</p></li>
<li><p>Giving five talks in state parks. I at least alluded to this!</p></li>
<li><p>Sharing lemon wine with friends I did! I didn‚Äôt think it was notable, though, but I suppose that it was. Once again, generally positive reviews<a href="#fn077" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Finishing my stack of letters. I also had a passive aggressive comment about getting a letter back. I not only finished the stack, I got three!<a href="#fn078" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> letters back.</p></li>
<li><p>Starting to do open mics regularly again I think I did one or two. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm in an open mic frame of mind anymore. Maybe it will come back to my life again at some point, but it certainly isn‚Äôt there now.</p></li>
<li><p>Staying up on all of my book clubs. I dropped one book club, and otherwise I think I did manage to do that.</p></li>
<li><p>Making progress on research. I did! My instrument makes plasma now, and my computational project got approved as a real thing I can devote actual energy to.<a href="#fn079" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Monetizing my story? I did not, though I did just get a review of my book that explicitly asked me to, so I guess that gets to go on this month‚Äôs?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at last month‚Äôs goals:<a href="#fn0710" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Finish my presentation on the Pleiades. Hey nice! I did it.</p></li>
<li><p>Make my home clean again. I made progress, which is like a success.</p></li>
<li><p>Blog more. Ummm, let me check. I blogged three more times!<a href="#fn0711" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Stretch daily. I stretched seven times. That is much less than daily, especially since I know that at least two of them happened in the same day.</p></li>
<li><p>Sleep enough and have a sleep schedule based around waking up no later than 6. I think I did more of the former and less of the latter. I guess I don‚Äôt even know if that‚Äôs true, upon thinking. I don‚Äôt wake up to alarms, but I don‚Äôt feel well rested. Maybe I need more vitamin D.</p></li>
<li><p>Be more intentional about prayer. Oops! This is becoming a perennial goal that I never reach. Maybe this month!</p></li>
<li><p>Get further ahead on the book. In particular, I‚Äôd like to set the goal of more than four chapters a week. Well, I did not do that at all. I fell slightly behind, I think, because I was a little ahead at the start of the month and ended exactly at cue. As you might expect from the lack of blogging during a two week period, there was minimal writing of the book going on then.</p></li>
<li><p>Write poetry every day. I wrote some poetry, though not much at all.</p></li>
<li><p>Finish stack of letters, and maybe think of more people to write to? Otherwise, start journaling during my morning time? I finished the stack, though I didn‚Äôt think of anyone new, and I did not start writing in a journal. I did use my blog much more as a journal, though, so I suppose that kind of counts, right?</p></li>
<li><p>Write a song. Wow! A goal that I reached with no qualifiers. Not only did I write a whole song, but I even have vocal drafts<a href="#fn0712" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> of a few more songs.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Things that I‚Äôm excited for this month:<a href="#fn0713" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Running more than five miles again!<a href="#fn0714" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Swimming with friends!<a href="#fn0715" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Giving my final talk in the parks for the season<a href="#fn0716" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> Coincidentally, this is also the final of the talk series for any speaker.</p></li>
<li><p>Recording a song!</p></li>
<li><p>Being ready for my upcoming talks.</p></li>
<li><p>Maybe<a href="#fn0717" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> give or at least hash out details for me to give my first invited talk at a college I do not attend.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Using last month‚Äôs goals, things I am excited about,<a href="#fn0718" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>, and my goals for this year of life as inspiration, this month‚Äôs goals:<a href="#fn0719" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Finish/make my talk on the eclipses. I have a lot of ideas, and I need to bang my head against the wall of learning how to animate until that wall breaks or I lose the motivation to do anything.</p></li>
<li><p>Make my home clean again. Listen, if I have the goal long enough, it might set in finally.</p></li>
<li><p>Blog more! I‚Äôm off to a terrible start, given that I‚Äôm writing this reflection on the third, but.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch and exercise more. I know that it is incredibly important to my mental health that I remain physically active.<a href="#fn0720" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> I also know that I hate how inflexible I am generally, and especially how inflexible I am now.</p></li>
<li><p>As before, sleep enough, and try to prioritize sleeping earlier. I know that my best sleep happens earlier in the night. I might try experimenting with biphasic sleeping<a href="#fn0721" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> since I seem to remember that working for me at some point in my life.</p></li>
<li><p>As always, be more intentional about prayer. Once more off to a bad start, but I really do feel better when I do. I think that spending at least fifteen minutes in the chapel each day<a href="#fn0722" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> is not an unreasonable goal. There isn‚Äôt anything that I need to do that I can‚Äôt push fifteen minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>Actually get ahead on my book. I would like to be five chapters ahead and to have plotted out the rest of this arc.<a href="#fn0723" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Write more poetry. Daily may not be realistic, especially since I haven‚Äôt written much this month.</p></li>
<li><p>Write or record a song. I have the year‚Äôs goal of recording an album. If there are twelve songs on my album<a href="#fn0724" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>, I need to record on average a little more than a song a month<a href="#fn0725" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>. I also want to do almost exclusively, if not actually exclusively, originals on my album.<a href="#fn0726" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Write five<a href="#fn0727" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> things I like about myself every day<a href="#fn0728" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>, three things I‚Äôm excited for, and ten things I‚Äôm grateful for. I keep seeing things about cultivating positivity, and I really need to do that right now.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Given these goals, the questions that I will need to answer each day:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I make progress on my eclipse talk(s)?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I fight against the entropy in my living space?</p></li>
<li><p>Have I been better about blogging?<a href="#fn0729" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I exercise?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I prioritize sleep?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I wake as early as I‚Äôd hoped?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I spend fifteen minutes in the chapel?</p></li>
<li><p>Am I writing more than the bare minimum for my book?</p></li>
<li><p>Am I making net progress on plotting my book?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write poetry?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I work on my album?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write five things I like about myself?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write three things I‚Äôm excited for?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write ten things I‚Äôm grateful for?</p></li>
<li><p>Generally, did I cultivate joy?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>And, as a day in September<a href="#fn0730" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a>, today‚Äôs responses:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I did not make progress in my talks, though last night I did realize how badly I explain them without props or images, which is like progress.</p></li>
<li><p>I have not, and may or may not today, honestly.</p></li>
<li><p>I mean, at the current rate of 1/3 days, no. I will not exceed 11 posts this month.</p></li>
<li><p>I‚Äôll stretch after this post.</p></li>
<li><p>I swam with friends!!</p></li>
<li><p>Oof. I mean, in my defense, I forgot an eye mask and was camping. In my offense<a href="#fn0731" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a>, I could‚Äôve remembered that or taken a nap at any point today.</p></li>
<li><p>I woke up a few times<a href="#fn0732" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a>, and got up around six thirty I think. That feels fine.</p></li>
<li><p>I‚Äôll go and do so after stretching/before I go to Mass tonight.</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote a chapter, which is arguably more. I‚Äôll try to at least plot out my goal for the next chapter<a href="#fn0733" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I mean, in the sense that I plotted four points to hit in the last chapter and hit one, yes.</p></li>
<li><p>No poetry. I‚Äôll see how I feel tonight.</p></li>
<li><p>I realized on the drive last night that at least one song needs to have a really driving piano beat.<a href="#fn0734" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> and I thought about what I might want, so kind of.</p></li>
<li><p>I typed, because I forgot my pen outside of my home and it‚Äôs not worth getting up to go get it right now.</p></li>
<li><p>Apparently ibid does not, in fact, like I always thought, mean ‚Äúsee above.‚Äù It instead means previous citation. I‚Äôll keep using it my way, though since it works. Anyways, that‚Äôs a long winded way of saying ibid.</p></li>
<li><p>ibid.</p></li>
<li><p>I don‚Äôt know; I think I tried, at least a little.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Oof, that was a bit of a marathon post. Sorry.</p>

<h1 id="family-board-games"><a href="board-game-night.html">Family Board Games</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 August 30</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Last night my family had our first<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> board game night. It was a really fun time, for all that it was much shorter than our historic marathon nights. We checked that we were able to play two games,<a href="#fn082" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> and we played through one of them.</p>
<p>Playing Ticket to Ride virtually is a much different experience than playing it live. Thankfully, it is not a game that has significant intrigue, and so the fact that I was playing with the rest of my family from behind a screen didn‚Äôt make too much of a difference. It was also really nice to not have to carefully place each of the incredibly small plastic trains on the page. The game layout also makes it incredibly clear how much of the game is left.<a href="#fn083" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>One interesting feature that the game offered is that, like some variations of chess, each player only has so much time to make every choice they will over the course of the game. I chose forty<a href="#fn084" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> five minutes per player, because that was the default for the game, and I didn‚Äôt know what changing it would do. I am now curious what would happen if you ran out of time, though. Would it skip your turn? Make you queue your move? I should try it sometime.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>No work on presentations. I might try to spend some time tomorrow or this weekend on it.</p></li>

<h1 id="talk-planning-redux"><a href="talk-planning-redux-1.html">Talk Planning, Redux</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 August 29</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p><a href="talk-planning-1">Last</a> <a href="talk-planning-2">year</a> <a href="talk-planning-3">I</a> gave a talk that was in part about tuning theory. Unsurprisingly, especially given the fact I had been thinking about that talk for years beforehand, I am not entirely happy with the talk that I gave. Mostly, I think that‚Äôs because I fell into the same trap that everyone does. Namely: it‚Äôs easy to explain how 3 to the n is never equal to 2 to the m<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, which means any system is inherently flawed.</p>
<p>As I keep thinking, though, there are other elements I could touch as well. After all, if you only want two notes, you can have a perfectly tuned scale with C and G.<a href="#fn092" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> If you want three notes, then you can even have a well tuned one with C, F, and G.<a href="#fn093" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The first issue, I suppose, comes between using three and five limit tuning. Now, for those who don‚Äôt already know,<a href="#fn094" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> limit tuning refers to the largest prime factor you can have in the denominator or numerator. Going through in order:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>One limit tuning: you can play a single note. Arguably, since it‚Äôs a single note, it is definitionally in tune</p></li>
<li><p>Two limit tuning: you can play octaves! Wow, harmony!<a href="#fn095" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Three limit tuning: you now get the fifth. Stacking two fifths<a href="#fn096" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> gives you a major second. Stacking three gives you a minor third, and so on until you build the twelve tone scale. Notably, it takes 7 fifths to build a diatonic scale, assuming you start from the correct note.<a href="#fn097" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> That works, but it gives you really wonky thirds, because</p></li>
<li><p>Five limit tuning<a href="#fn098" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>: adds the major and by extension minor third. When building up the ratios, 1 to 2 is an octave, 2 to 3 is a fifth, 3 to 4 is a fourth<a href="#fn099" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>, 4 to 5 is a major third, 5 to 6 is a minor third.<a href="#fn0910" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> The third in 3 limit tuning is<a href="#fn0911" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> 81:64, which is not quite the same. From this, you only need F, C, and G to produce a diatonic scale! Wow, progress</p></li>
<li><p>Seven limit tuning introduces the harmonic seventh. For those who haven‚Äôt heard of that, that‚Äôs because we don‚Äôt really use it in western music.<a href="#fn0912" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Since the harmonic seventh of C lies more or less equidistant between B flat and B,<a href="#fn0913" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> there isn‚Äôt much of a use for it, and by extension, any further limit in western tuning.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Ok how did I get here? Right, how tuning theory is broken for multiple reasons. I think that a five limit diatonic scale should work perfectly, assuming you only want to play in one key. I have an inclination that it would break down even as fast as adding the dominant or subdominant keys.<a href="#fn0914" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> Yeah it breaks down immediately.</p>
<p>Ok I know that I‚Äôve done other prep work for the talk, but my notes are all very far away, and getting to them feels like a lot of effort with minimal payoff. Anyways, all this to say, the new talk on tuning theory will go deeper into the math than my last one did, even if I never give it to a single real person.</p>

<li id="fn092" role="doc-endnote"><p>why I always start my scales on C is beyond me. Probably all the accidents relating to white note keys. Eh, it‚Äôs not worth being concerned about I suppose<a href="#fn09ref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">‚Ü©Ô∏é</a></p></li>
<li id="fn093" role="doc-endnote"><p>I‚Äôm not totally sure what a minor 7th is supposed to be, but at least the first three notes are fine.<a href="#fn09ref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">‚Ü©Ô∏é</a></p></li>

<li id="fn095" role="doc-endnote"><p>ok so actually, there‚Äôs a concept for consonance and dissonance where it‚Äôs how far the notes are harmonically (I mean duh, but my words aren‚Äôt working, hence why I‚Äôm doing talk planning). The most consonant interval is obviously the octave (since unison isn‚Äôt really an interval), and it has a distance of one. A fifth has a distance of two, as does two octaves. I think that matches my experience well, though I need to find the source paper so I can read it (I think I saw it in a 12tone video at some point). From a quick google, it seems like they might be doing log of the least common multiple of the two notes. In that case, once again, there is no way to make a fifth and octaves be the same harmonic distance. At a first order, though, a fifth (2:3) would be six as LCM, and so lies between two and three octaves in terms of dissonance. Ok enough diversion, back to the actual text<a href="#fn09ref5" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">‚Ü©Ô∏é</a></p></li>
<li id="fn096" role="doc-endnote"><p>for this and everything, assume that I still believe in octave equivalence (for all that I‚Äôm more and more intellectually willing to not)<a href="#fn09ref6" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">‚Ü©Ô∏é</a></p></li>
<li id="fn097" role="doc-endnote"><p>in this case, building from the fourth (fa, or F (hmmmm I wonder if there‚Äôs something to the fact that the fourth (f) is fa (f) and the note f (f). eh probably nothing new)<a href="#fn09ref7" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">‚Ü©Ô∏é</a></p></li>
<li id="fn098" role="doc-endnote"><p>remember, it‚Äôs primes, so four adds nothing new<a href="#fn09ref8" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">‚Ü©Ô∏é</a></p></li>
<li id="fn099" role="doc-endnote"><p>because we define a fifth and a fourth to be an octave, and 2 to four is absolutely an octave<a href="#fn09ref9" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">‚Ü©Ô∏é</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0910" role="doc-endnote"><p>because we define a major and a minor third to be a fifth, and four to six is a fifth<a href="#fn09ref10" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">‚Ü©Ô∏é</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0911" role="doc-endnote"><p>ok some quick math: 3/2 is G, 3/2 times 3/2 is 9/8 (octave equiv) is D, 3/2 more is 27/16 is A, 81/64 is E. 1.265<a href="#fn09ref11" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">‚Ü©Ô∏é</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0912" role="doc-endnote"><p>though there are a lot of arguments that the blues and jazz use it, since they use something known as a blue note, which is halfway between a major and minor third, like this is<a href="#fn09ref12" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">‚Ü©Ô∏é</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0913" role="doc-endnote"><p>968 cents, according to wikipedia (and no, I will not be getting into what a cent is right now, because I don‚Äôt care that much)<a href="#fn09ref13" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">‚Ü©Ô∏é</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0914" role="doc-endnote"><p>but I should really work out the math. Let‚Äôs see, we get A from F and then A from D if we do dominant. A from D would be 27/16, whereas A from F is 4/3 for F and then the fifth is 4 to 5 so 15/8. Nope, 5/3 actually. That makes more sense. 1.6875 is not quite 1.6 repeating, though they are shockingly close. I suppose that playing the two together could work. I also suppose taking the harmonic (i think that‚Äôs the right word, the log based one) average of the two could work<a href="#fn09ref14" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">‚Ü©Ô∏é</a></p></li>
