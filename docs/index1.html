    <h1 id="what-i-read-and-wrote"><a href="reading-writing-23-12-28.html">What I Read and Wrote</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 December 28</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As I mentioned <a href="schedules-3.html">yesterday</a>, Thursdays are going to be reserved for what I’m reading and writing lately. It is currently a form of vacation for me right now, which means that I am doing far less of both than normal.<a href="#fn001" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>In terms of reading, this past month<a href="#fn002" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> I finished:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Genesis of Gender by Abigail Favale. The book came recommended to me, and it’s a deconstruction of modern gender theory from a former gender theory professor who converted to Catholicism. I found it better the more I read the book, probably because the focus shifted towards the latter parts. I may or may not discuss it in greater depth in the future, depending on how starved for content I become.</p></li>
<li><p>There’s a serialized version of C.S. Lewis’s Screwtape Letters<a href="#fn003" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> that ended this year’s run in December. It was a much different experience to read the book in short weekly snippets.</p></li>
<li><p>I listened through C. Mantis’s Path of Ascension<a href="#fn004" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. I think that it’s my third or fourth read through, since I’ve been following the serial since early on in its career on the internet.</p></li>
<li><p>I also listened through Casualfarmer’s Beware of Chicken, which is another former web serial turned book available from an indie publisher.</p></li>
<li><p>I read through Peter Kreeft’s Fundamentals of the Faith. It was a really beautiful book, but I unfortunately<a href="#fn005" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> gave it away to a friend.</p></li>
<li><p>I finished Dr. Bessel van der Kolk’s The Body Keeps the Score, which I’ve been working on in theory since last year. I found that it was much easier to get through in audio format, but that may have just been where I was at for that week.</p></li>
<li><p>I listened to one of the recommended reads for my entire campus, Clint Smith’s How the Word is Passed. It was an interesting reflection on the way that America has or hasn’t dealt with slavery and the consequences of chattel slavery. I know that it changed my views of the Confederacy at least a little, if only because I tend to be sympathetic to foot soldiers.<a href="#fn006" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I listened to Travis Baldree’s Legends and Lattes. I know the author primarily as an audio book reader, so I was very interested in his book when it came out. It’s apparently become a fairly well known book, at least in the sense that I’ve seen it more places than any of the books I’ve heard of his.</p></li>
<li><p>After watching CGP Grey’s video about how to be miserable<a href="#fn007" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>, I read the book that he based it on, How to Be Miserable: 40 Strategies you already use by Randy Paterson. It was really eye opening to me how half of the items or so I read and went “who would ever do that?” and the other half were habits I hardly realized I had, they were so ingrained.</p></li>
<li><p>I generally kept up on the web serials that I’m reading. Path of Ascension and Beware of Chicken both post fairly consistent updates, which is fun. It’s wild how far ahead the freely available content is from the nominally published.<a href="#fn008" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>That more or less sums up the reading<a href="#fn009" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> that I’ve been doing. In terms of writing, I’ve written a fair amount of code, though that’s been a lot of writing long functions just to delete them when I realize that I don’t want the functionality they provide.<a href="#fn0010" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> I’ve recently been taking a break from Jeb, which has been really restful, though I am excited to get back to writing it. I wrote a fair number of sonnets this month, and I finally got to the point that writing a sonnet is hardly an effort, even if it isn’t good.</p>
<p>Oh! I suppose that I’ve also been reading the book on writing, Writing Well by Sven Birkerts and Donald Hall. It’s a fantastic book, and I’m really enjoying the way that it’s making me think about the way that I write and consume language. I just finished the section of words, and one piece of advice they kept repeating in that section is that “a change in style, however slight, is a change in meaning, however slight”. I feel like often, at least in my experience, people don’t treat rephrased sentences as different meaning. As someone who does legitimately believe that no distinguishable wordings are fungible,<a href="#fn0011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> it was nice to have that take explicitly stated. Even the difference between “I read a book” and “a book was read by me” has a shade of difference, even outside of the taste. Of course, the taste of words is not something that they underestimate. One piece of advice they stress almost as much as not mixing metaphors or using dead cliches is having sentences flow. I’ve just started the sentence section, so I haven’t heard exactly what they mean by it, but I am excited to find out.</p>
<p>I also just started the first of my Saturday Musings, which is focused about copyright. I don’t know if it will end up being the first Saturday Musing I post, because it’s a lot to write about, but I hope to do the subject justice. I’d also like to start plotting out the next few chapters of my web serial, and now is as good of a time as any, I suppose. Plotted out the next three and a half chapters, and I’m excited to write them again. If I was smart, I would find a writing guide that actually teaches how plotting works, since right now I just kind of free associate what I want to see and then write in details.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I embroider today? Shoot! I should do that tomorrow. It’s too late o clock right now.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I play guitar today? No, sadly today was more focused on real work.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I practice touch typing today? Once again, a few lessons. I think that it might not be the best choice ever to go straight from 50 wpm goal to 75 wpm. Might be a smarter choice to do smaller, more iterative versions, where I go up by like 5 wpm at a time. Then again, it isn’t like I need to worry about optimizing this. Any typing practice is probably ninety percent as effective as any other.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Reading</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have I made progress on my Currently Reading Shelf? I am!</p></li>
<li><p>Did I read the book on craft? I read it a little last night and then a fair amount this morning!</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I blog? Kind of! More brain dump than anything else, but that’s life sometimes.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write ahead on Jeb? I plotted out a few chapters, which is nice.</p></li>
<li><p>Letter to friends? I met with one and set up a meeting with another!</p></li>
<li><p>Paper? I once again proved to myself and the smart people<a href="#fn0012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> in my life that, not only can I not use derivative based methods for most of the work, I cannot even use most derivative free methods for optimization.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Wellness</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How well did I pray? Remaining less than great. This is something I’d like to work on in the future.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I spend my time well? Kind of! I spent a lot of time with family again, caught up with a close friend, and did some research work. Between that, pretty well.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? sadness.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I exercise? sorrow.</p></li>
<li><p>Water? Remembered I was thirsty at one occasion and then drank water! That counts for something!</p></li>
</ul></li>

<h1 id="on-schedules"><a href="schedules-3.html">On Schedules</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 December 27</p>
<h1 id="draft-3">Draft 3</h1>
<p>I’ve mused <a href="schedules.html">a</a> <a href="meta-schedules.html">few</a> <a href="schedules-2.html">times</a> about schedules on this blog. I have also mused more than a few times about writer’s block or general struggles to find a prompt for the day.<a href="#fn011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Finally, I’ve started realizing that I want to try writing better essays, and that the most effective way to do that is by spending more chronological time with the essay as a work in progress. There’s an old expression about birds and stones that feels relevant here.</p>
<p>To write better musings, I need to be able to spend more time on a musing. The amount of mental energy that it takes to come up with a prompt and start exploring it is such that I cannot really dedicate myself to writing two completely disparate and unique musings at once.<a href="#fn012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Additionally, I do better with deadlines. There’s an expression I once heard in a class<a href="#fn013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, which goes something like “a work of art isn’t finished until it’s wrested from the author’s grasp”. Or, in slightly more real terms, as Jim Butcher once said, “I don’t have a muse, I have a mortgage”.</p>
<p>All that to say, I think that it is important for me to schedule not just a day where I post more in depth musings, but also a more scheduled way of musing overall so that I have the mental space to write it.<a href="#fn014" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Having spoken to my family, they still think that it is too ambitious to write a blog post every day, keep up with my research and work, record an album, and keep up with my web novel.<a href="#fn015" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> However, I think that I have the space to be able to do so, at least for now, as long as I make some changes.</p>
<p>Moving forwards, I will reduce the mental load on myself by scheduling each day’s activity. Sundays, as you might expect, will continue to be dedicated to Reflections on the Readings.<a href="#fn016" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Fridays, as well, will remain focused on Flash Fiction Friday musings.<a href="#fn017" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Saturdays, I have decided, will be for long form writing.</p>
<p>Now, this is three of seven days. Even that is more planning than I have been typically doing<a href="#fn018" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>, but that’s not enough. Also, as mentioned, my family is worried about my ability to remain focused on research. To help with that, I will be dedicating the Monday Musing of each week to Thesis Work.<a href="#fn019" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> My thought there is that starting each week with writing explicitly focused on my thesis will help me to remain focused on my life goal.<a href="#fn0110" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>On Wednesdays I will muse about the progress on my album. Wednesdays tend to be one of my freest nights, which gives me the space to do some last minute writing or recording if I feel behind. Additionally, since it will often be a short reflection, that will give me more time for writing.</p>
<p>Thursdays will be dedicated to quick recaps of what I have been reading or writing. Partially, this is because Thursdays tend to be busy nights for me, and often what I read and write does not change week to week. However, I do also want to be more intentional about what I’m reading and writing, and I think that needing to reflect on them weekly will help me with that.</p>
<p>The astute among<a href="#fn0111" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> readers may note that this only describes six days of the week. The week, however,<a href="#fn0112" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> is seven days long. I know that many musings that I might be interested in pursuing do not deserve or warrant<a href="#fn0113" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> a full week of consideration<a href="#fn0114" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>, and I want the freedom to be able to write about whatever I want at least once a week. I think that I know myself well enough to know that I do best when I have some freedom, however constrained. Giving myself one day a week to let musings die will probably be a good valve for my stress to escape.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I embroider today? I went through another needle’s worth of embroidery! I think that I only need two or three more total strands, given that I’ve filled in about a quarter of the grid.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I play guitar today? I also took today off, which is probably less great given that I want to start writing for an album.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I practice touch typing today? A few lessons! I’m kind of unsure how it prioritizes which letters go when, but I think that it might be lowest wpm letter<a href="#fn0115" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> going through?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Reading</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have I made progress on my Currently Reading Shelf? I’m enjoying the book once more, which is really nice.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I read the book on craft? I brought it with me, but it is currently dark, so I don’t think that I’ll be reading it for at least a little longer (if at all)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I blog? Three drafts may have been the right number for this musing.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write ahead on Jeb? I should probably start Jeb again tomorrow.</p></li>
<li><p>Letter to friends? Met with two and set up a meeting with a third!</p></li>
<li><p>Paper? I will try to work on it tomorrow as well.<a href="#fn0116" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Wellness</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How well did I pray? oof.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I spend my time well? Eh! I wrote this which I’m pretty proud of, and I spent a lot of time with family.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? Should probably delete this goal. Won’t but will continue to feel bad.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I exercise? Nope</p></li>
<li><p>Water? Eh. not a lot</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>I’ve mused <a href="schedules.html">a</a> <a href="meta-schedules.html">few</a> <a href="schedules-2.html">times</a> about schedules on this blog. Additionally, I have mused more than a few times about writer’s block or general struggles to find a prompt for the day.<a href="#fn0117" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> There’s an old expression about birds and stones that feels relevant here.</p>
<p>As I’ve grown older, I’ve realized that schedules generally make my life better. I not only prefer to know where I’m going and what I’m doing when, but also find that it makes me more productive. As I’ve grown older, though, I’ve also gotten more and more freedom to set my own schedules.</p>
<p>Because I know that I need schedules, I have begun to find ways to govern myself. At least once every few months, I try some strategy to keep me productive through every minute of the day.<a href="#fn0118" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> Without fail, these plans fail. However, I’ve gotten better at following the advice of some random blogger somewhere, who said that it’s far far healthier to reframe that. That is, rather than saying that I failed to keep up my tracking activities to the minute, I could instead say that for the week I did track my time, I was more productive. Things can serve you for short periods of time without becoming permanent fixtures.<a href="#fn0119" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>However, there are kinds of schedules that I do find I can keep myself on, at least in general.<a href="#fn0120" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> In general, things which occur monthly or weekly are much easier for me to keep up on. Daily activities that don’t need to be done in a schedule can also be easier to keep up on, which isn’t really relevant here. The fact that I can do things with a weekly schedule is the way that I can kill the birds with a stone.</p>
<p>There is even a third bird that my suggestion will help ricochet to.</p>
<p>Sorry, I have written about 500 words in footnotes for this draft, and I find that I’ve completely lost the thread of this musing. Time to try again (if you didn’t read the footnotes, they’re a time).</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>I’ve mused a few times before<a href="#fn0121" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> about schedules. As I come to another day where none of the prompts that I have feel particularly good, I’m going to jump the gun on 2024’s New Year’s Resolutions and start talking about my schedule. I’d like to start writing one really good essay a week.<a href="#fn0122" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>I think that one way I can get through that is by scheduling other blog posts to be more mundane, and therefore require less energy, with the goal and expectation that I then use the extra time and mental space to write parts of a longer and better thought out musing. So, what are things that I want to keep up on every week?</p>
<p>Maybe I should take a step back and ask what things I want to prioritize in the next year.</p>
<p>Nope, that’s a bad idea because most of what I want to prioritize are habits.</p>
<p>There are seven days each week. If Sundays are reserved for Reflections on the Gospel or Readings generally<a href="#fn0123" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>, and I want to spend Saturdays on a more in depth writing, what do I do with the other five days?</p>
<p>I want to do more composition, so one day a week could be reserved for my progress getting through species counterpoint. Actually, let’s take a moment and decide whether I actually want to keep learning species counterpoint. The choir I’m in has implied that it would be willing<a href="#fn0124" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> to let me compose some music, but I don’t really know if that’s something that fits into my life. Right now writing is really becoming a huge part of it, and I think that I would like that to continue.</p>
<p>One day a week could be reserved for me to reflect on the writing I’ve done over the past week. I think that monthly and daily checkins might be the wrong level for me to be motivated to outwrite on my web novel.</p>
<p>Since I want to make progress on the album, one day a week could be reserved for talking about it. Right now, I need to write and record and all the other parts of songs, so there’s bound to be stuff to talk about re: difficulties, fun parts, etc. That brings us to four.</p>
<p>If I continue doing open mics semi regularly, talking about them could be fun. When I consider that open mics tend to run opposite a DND campaign that I’m in, we get Mondays taken care of. Then again, I don’t want to have to force myself to do those activities or muse about them.</p>
<p>Still, four days a week of musings is better than one. One day a week could be a brief review of everything that I’ve read.<a href="#fn0125" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> That actually sounds really fun, especially because I can also jot down my notes somewhere more cogent. On weeks that I feel like reviewing a book, it can go there, and on other weeks I can just discuss the reading that I’ve been doing.</p>
<p>One day a week devoted to working on my thesis would probably not go amiss. Since I want it to be fairly long, I do need to get a lot of writing done. I do worry about the fact that I would like those to also be edited, and the musing format tends to be more informal than I’d like. Still, I am sure that I could find at least one thing to quickly talk about each week, especially since I want to work on making a lot of my research more approachable to the general person.</p>
<p>(took a break to play some backgammon, time to start musing again)</p>
<p>Right now we have:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sunday: Reflections on Readings</p></li>
<li><p>Saturday: Better Musing</p></li>
<li><p>A Day: What I’ve been Reading</p></li>
<li><p>A Day: Thesis Work (very nominal, can be as vague as needed)</p></li>
<li><p>A Day: Progress on the Album</p></li>
<li><p>A Day: Progress on writing generally</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Oh shoot! I also have flash fiction fridays! That takes up my whole weekend, so then we should probably get rid of one of the seven so that I have time to have one day free? There are absolutely topics I want to discuss that I don’t think deserve a full length essay.<a href="#fn0126" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>so:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sunday: Reflections on Readings</p>
<p>Rationale: I’m obligated to attend Mass on Sunday, it’s the day that I’ve been told I should set aside for the Lord, and it’s a good habit to make me more prayerful.</p></li>
<li><p>Monday: Thesis Work.</p>
<p>Rationale: Starting the week with active productivity will make me better at work generally and should help me prime the week to come.</p></li>
<li><p>Tuesday: Free day.</p>
<p>Rationale: I filled the other six days and I want one day where I’m free to write whatever is on my mind/ generally have a day to discuss what’s going on.</p></li>
<li><p>Wednesday: Progress on the Album.</p>
<p>Rationale: Wednesdays are my freest evenings, for all that I teach a discussion section until 5pm those days. As a result, when I’m not as far along as I want to be, I can use the rest of the night to write or record</p></li>
<li><p>Thursday What I’m reading/ writing.</p>
<p>Rationale: I think that it makes most sense to alternate these or maybe do both each week. Of the things that I want to do, these are the freest, and so I feel like deserve to get crammed together.</p></li>
<li><p>Friday: Flash Fiction Friday.</p>
<p>Rationale: the event is on Fridays, and I think that it will continue to do me good to think about it.</p></li>
<li><p>Saturday: Long form Musing.</p>
<p>Rationale: Saturdays should be days of rest, and that way I have the whole week to look forward to the writing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For all that this feels very ordered on the page, a retrospective note should say that I wrote it in order: Sunday, Monday, Friday, Saturday, Wednesday, Thursday, Tuesday.</p>
<p>1000 words later, let’s try to make this coherent?</p>

<h1 id="on-practicing-scales"><a href="practicing-scales.html">On Practicing Scales</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 December 26</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>I’ve talked on this blog many times about the fact that I often struggle with finding a topic for my musings. Today I began to look for inspiration in that best of places, my own blog.<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I found an old footnote about the fact that I don’t really like the phrase eating your vegetables, and prefer practicing your scales.</p>
<p>There are a variety of reasons for that. Obviously, there’s the fact that I tend to enjoy vegetables,<a href="#fn022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> which makes the expression not resonate for me. Additionally, there is the fact that<a href="#fn023" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> I tend to hear eating your vegetables in the context of things which are beneficial to a small domain of tasks, while eating vegetables is something which is generally good and helpful for overall life quality. And, most importantly,<a href="#fn024" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> I tend to find that people use the expression not as a way of expressing need, but as a way to emphasize the difference between Amateur and Dilettante.<a href="#fn025" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>What do I mean by that?<a href="#fn026" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>I mean that I’ll be using the words as they initially were meant<a href="#fn027" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>, or for those less comfortable with that, I’ll be using the words based on their Latin roots.<a href="#fn028" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> That is, an Amateur is one who loves a craft, while a Dilettante simply enjoys it<a href="#fn029" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>. What’s the difference?<a href="#fn0210" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Well, what’s the difference between love and enjoyment? Love, to me, at least, has an element of growth. Enjoyment, on the other hand, asks and assumes nothing of that.</p>
<p>To practice scales, then, is to accept the unpleasant parts of a craft because you understand the benefits. As someone<a href="#fn0211" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> says, you don’t get to choose whether you go in the dirt, only what dirt you go in.<a href="#fn0212" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>I think it’s an important distinction, and one that really will be helpful to me as I continue framing my life.<a href="#fn0213" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> What does it mean to practice scales?</p>
<p>On almost every instrument, one of the assignments that an instructor gives fairly early in the pedagogy is practicing scales and variations thereof.<a href="#fn0214" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> Why?<a href="#fn0215" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> Even though almost no song is exclusively a scale,<a href="#fn0216" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> the majority of most music, especially music in the canon<a href="#fn0217" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> is primarily written in a scalar fashion. The reasons for that are ancient and long enduring, but it is generally easier for most people to sing scalar melodies.<a href="#fn0218" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>However, unless you are dedicating yourself to the craft,<a href="#fn0219" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> you almost never need to work on scales. If we move to the kitchen, one of the first tasks that I’ve heard every culinary institute or restaurant requires of its chefs is chopping loads and loads of vegetables perfectly and uniformly. As someone who merely enjoys cooking, I will probably never bother to do that. However, I also accept that the fact that I do not practice julienning or any other technique on countless thousands of carrots does mean that there is a level of reproducibility and refinement that my cooking will never have.</p>
<p>So, as someone who does not believe that it’s necessary to practice scales, I can choose to do so. When I practice scales, it is with the knowledge that, assuming my goal is to improve at the craft, the best use of my time is probably spent working on scales. However, there are many things that I do but do not love doing.<a href="#fn0220" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> Even if I enjoy them, it is not worth the effort of getting better for the sake of getting better.</p>
<p>When I work on embroidery, though, right now I am actively striving to improve. There may be something questionable in the fact that I intrinsically tie love with desire to improve, but I don’t know if I want to unpack that right now.<a href="#fn0221" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> Since I am dedicated to improving, I am willing to take time to simply embroider a specific stitch or test swatch over and over until it’s perfect.</p>
<p>In crochet, however, I don’t really care about getting better. Right now I know that I am good enough at crochet to make anything that I want to make. As a result, I’m not going to spend time, energy, and yarn, working on a specific skill simply to be better at that skill, even if it would be generally helpful to my overall craft.</p>
<p>Woof. This musing got away from me a little. Eh, I think that I got somewhere good, even if it’s only coherent to me.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I embroider today? I plotted out the actual next project I have and then started it.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I play guitar today? Took today off.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I practice touch typing today? Spent a little bit of time on it, I don’t know if I actually made any progress.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Reading</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have I made progress on my Currently Reading Shelf? A little bit. I’m not enjoying the book right now, but that could have any number of causes.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I read the book on craft? I did not, for all that I thought about it a lot.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write a sonnet? I think that I’m done with sonnets for the month. I can do them quickly, and right now I want to just spend my time with my family<a href="#fn0222" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? Look at this! It even has some elements of growth.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write ahead on Jeb? At some point I need to start again. If I want to be five chapters ahead by the third, I really need to pick up the pace.</p></li>
<li><p>Letter to friends? Nope! A friend set up a meeting time, though, so that’s good enough.</p></li>
<li><p>Paper? I’ve started thinking again.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Wellness</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How well did I pray? Badly, but maybe better.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I spend my time well? I’ve decided that anything that I do with family counts as time well spent.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? Nope.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I exercise? Kind of! Because we had activities, if no other reason.</p></li>
<li><p>Water? Eh, not really.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As much as I do trust the book on writing, I want to write my musings as essays only. So, despite the fact that they recommend writing my essays where the first draft is not a full essay, but as pieces, I will not be taking their advice. Of course, I am starting my musing<a href="#fn0223" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> from a much further point than normal. I already know what I want to muse about, and I already even have some concepts ready.</p>
<p>I was struggling to come up with a musing idea today. I read through some old musings that I made, and found inspiration. Today I finally started embroidering again. I thought that could be a good place to start, so I read through my old musings on embroidering.</p>
<p>In the footnote of <a href="embroidery-2.html">my second musing</a>, I mentioned that something good to muse about could be the concept of practicing your scales. Practicing your scales, to me at least, is a better metaphor than eating your vegetables. There are a few reasons for that.</p>
<p>First, I honestly tend to enjoy eating vegetables. The concept of eating your vegetables tends to be something unenjoyable but necessary.</p>
<p>Second, and far more importantly, I tend to think of eating your vegetables as something you do that is undesirable but good for a specific activity. Eating your vegetables is<a href="#fn0224" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> something that you have to do for general life purposes.</p>
<p>So, what does practicing your scales mean?</p>
<p>First, I don’t know that I’ve ever actually met someone who enjoys working on scales.<a href="#fn0225" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> Second<a href="#fn0226" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a>, working on scales is not, strictly speaking, necessary.<a href="#fn0227" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> Scales make music far easier, especially when you take scale not just mean playing the notes of a given key up and down stepwise, but also with some small intervals, like thirds and maybe fourths.<a href="#fn0228" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> The fact that they are not needed but make life far easier and better is really where this metaphor works.</p>
<p>So, at this point in the musing, we can either go for how we can use the metaphors or why scales are helpful. Or, I guess that the initial musing talked about how I’m only now enough of an adult to practice my scales, so I suppose that I could focus there. I think that I want to go with the first.</p>
<p>What does it mean to practice scales in other domains?</p>
<p>What are other domains? I suppose that for many athletes, cardio or strength is the equivalent. If you enjoy running or lifting, though, that metaphor breaks down a little.</p>
<p>Other domains include writing? I suppose that the practice I’m doing typing could count. Let’s talk about that (in the next draft).<a href="#fn0229" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> What else could count? In some regards, the reading about writing that I do is practicing scales.</p>
<p>Oh gosh, there’s a concern now that I could treat the parts of my craft I’m comparing here to practicing scales as something that is less than enjoyable. I assume that this will not be an issue, since I don’t plan on remembering this.<a href="#fn0230" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>Ok so reading about writing, practicing touch typing, arguably even the writing that I’m doing right now.</p>
<p>In music, there’s scales and fingering exercises, obviously.</p>
<p>In cooking, there’s repeating recipes? Practicing cutting? Oh yeah that’s the equivalent. Practicing just cutting to make everything perfect.</p>
<p>Oh hey, that makes me think that practicing scales is what separates masters from amateurs.<a href="#fn0231" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>As the above footnote points out, to be an amateur is historically to do something for love. Where did that shift come from? Oh duh, the word was initially used to refer to the rich gentlemen of England, who pursued a craft out of love, rather than to make a living. When we shift to the fact that America doesn’t really believe in class<a href="#fn0232" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a>, it makes sense that there would be a semantic shift. Dilettante is apparently a similar word.</p>
<p>Anyways, what separates the amateur from the not?</p>
<p>What’s the opposite of an amateur?</p>
<p>Because of how fully the world has shifted to thinking of amateur<a href="#fn0233" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> as non professional, it’s hard to think of the type of person who does the work primarily for the need. Oh wait, my opposite is not one who works for a living, but one who does not truly love a craft.</p>
<p>Dilettante<a href="#fn0234" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> works great for that. It comes from delight, with connotations historically and always as one who does something because it’s fun.</p>
<p>Ok so practicing scales is what separates the Amateur<a href="#fn0235" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> from the Dilettante. Great! That sounds like a good musing idea.<a href="#fn0236" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>So, let’s start with “what does it mean to practice scales?”</p>
<p>Practicing scales is similar to something that other people talk about: eating your vegetables.</p>
<p>Ok so as much as I want to focus on dilettante rather than amateur, I do still want to title the file practicing scales. I also do want to muse about that, for all that it doesn’t take much to do that. I feel like one hundred words is enough to explain it. Let’s try second draft and see what it looks like.</p>

<h1 id="christmas-2023"><a href="christmas-2023.html">Christmas 2023</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 December 25</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>This is now <a href="christmas-2018.html">my</a> <a href="christmas-2022.html">third</a> musing on Christmas. As with the other two, I’m publishing it on Christmas Day.<a href="#fn031" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>My previous musings about Christmas have been fairly short. The first<a href="#fn032" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> was four sentences. Half of those were less than four words a piece.<a href="#fn033" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> The second was a little longer, but focused almost exclusively on the liturgical readings.</p>
<p>Today, I’d like to focus a little on the traditions that my family has kept. As I grow older, I find that I’ve been thinking a lot more about what parts of my life I’d like to keep forever, what parts I wish never happened, and what I think served its purpose and is no longer needed.</p>
<p>Our Christmas mornings tend to start with cinnamon rolls. This past Thanksgiving, my little brother<a href="#fn034" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> and I realized that we both had fond memories of orange rolls as children. We still are not entirely certain which family member we had the rolls for,<a href="#fn035" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> but we do know why we stopped having them. In short, none of the extant adults in my family like them.<a href="#fn036" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> I did not remember that, however, and got orange rolls for the morning after Thanksgiving.<a href="#fn037" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> My little brother and I loved them, and so this year’s Christmas morning breakfast also included orange rolls.<a href="#fn038" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Moving slightly back in the chronology, we get matching pajamas as a family every year. We open them on Christmas Eve, and then we all wear them on Christmas day. A related tradition: the children take a photo with Santa every year. Once we reached an age that it stopped seeming reasonable to go to the Santa in town,<a href="#fn039" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> we started taking them as a family on Christmas morning. We’ve now merged the two traditions, and it’s really fun getting to look back and see the siblings in matching clothes.</p>
<p>We do a gift exchange after the photos<a href="#fn0310" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>, and then we make a quick breakfast and eat it. After that, we play a board game.<a href="#fn0311" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> By that point, we’re all tired of each other<a href="#fn0312" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>, so we tend to be free until dinner. For some reason, I have no memories of what we historically eat for Christmas dinner.</p>
<p>All in all, I love the fact that my family’s Christmas is what it is. I’m sure that at least some portion of my attachment to the traditions comes from the fact that they’re the traditions that we have. If I had grown with others, I am sure that I would have loved them just as much.<a href="#fn0313" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I embroider today? I plotted out the next embroidery project I want to work on. Unfortunately, I did not start on it until 2100, and that is far too late to start embroidering for the day. Maybe tomorrow.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I play guitar today? Just a touch! But I did enjoy the amount that I did.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I practice touch typing today? I made it all the way to Q! It bothers me more than a little that the last letter we get is J, but as soon as I make it through the Q, I’m through all the letters at at least 50 wpm, which means that it becomes time to reset the goal with much higher wpm. Probably closer to 70, since that really is my goal speed. Then again, it isn’t really like I need to be able to type q at 70 wpm, since most of the time I won’t need it. B is the big issue letter today<a href="#fn0314" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>, so at least that’s progress, since C no longer is a struggle for me I guess.</p>
<p>Update a few minutes later, I’ve officially gotten the entire alphabet at 50 words per minute. Now it’s time to up the goal to 75 and see what happens. Ooh cool! It saves my progress, so now I just had to restart with A, and then go to Y. That’s pretty fun. I am wondering whether it might be in my best interest to set the intermediate goal a little lower. Idk.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Reading</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have I made progress on my Currently Reading Shelf? Nope! But that’s ok! I spent the day with my family instead.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I read the book on craft? Shoot! Hopefully tomorrow.</p></li>
<li><p>Have I read the library books? Not even a little. Let’s see if we cannot do more of that next month in particular. I feel like my schedule doesn’t really exist when I’m at home.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write a sonnet? I wrote one yesterday, and I’m going to take today off from writing one, since it’s very late out, and I would rather sleep.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? Another day where I’m not thrilled with the quality, but that’s life, I suppose.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write ahead on Jeb? It’s Christmas, so that’s obviously not happening either.</p></li>
<li><p>Letter to friends? I sent all the Christmas notes, and I had some good conversations with friends.</p></li>
<li><p>Paper? It remains a holy day.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Wellness</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How well did I pray? Not great.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I spend my time well? I think so!</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? No. Sad.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I exercise? Shockingly! A little, if only because there were some activities today.</p></li>
<li><p>Water? I drank water to the point that I no longer wanted it today! I’m very proud of myself.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>This is now <a href="christmas-2018.html">my</a> <a href="christmas-2022.html">third</a> musing on Christmas. As with the other two, I’m publishing it on Christmas Day.<a href="#fn0315" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> Apparently both of my musings on Christmas have been fairly short.</p>
<p>My initial musing, published in the initial iteration of this blog, was four sentences, half of which were under four words. My musing last year, being a combined Christmas and Reflection on Readings, was a little longer, and focused more on the liturgical aspect of the season.</p>
<p>This year, however, I am writing this musing early enough that I have time to actually think,<a href="#fn0316" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> and not on a Sunday.<a href="#fn0317" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> As a result, I find that I have more time to consider what I want to muse about.</p>
<p>So, what do I want to muse about? The book on the craft of writing suggests that it’s best to plan to spend half the time you have allotted to an essay on planning and half on actually writing. I don’t think that will be a part of my life for a while, but let’s try some of what they suggest.</p>
<p>One piece of advice was to do some free association. Christmas to Christmas movies to Scrooge. Christmas, advent, awaiting, Christmas, stockings, family, loved ones.</p>
<p>OK my mind doesn’t do free word association well right now.<a href="#fn0318" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>What are things that I did today?</p>
<p>Texted wishes for a happy Christmas to friends<a href="#fn0319" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>, and had some nice digital conversations with them. I spent time with family, which was lovely as always!<a href="#fn0320" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> In particular, we played games as a family, had some meals together, and did a small gift exchange.</p>
<p>I’ve started writing this musing, which is something. I honestly think that may be literally everything that I’ve done today. Ok so maybe musing about today as a thing isn’t a great idea. My family’s reaction to me saying who all I was texting today makes me think a musing about that might not be welcome either.</p>
<p>That’s really it for today. So, let’s think about what Christmas in general means to me? Let’s see what that sparks. I guess the question is if I want to focus on the cultural or religious connotations that Christmas has for me.<a href="#fn0321" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>Having now made, eaten, and cleaned up from dinner, there’s probably something I can muse about combining my post about family recipes, the fact that we only use red potatoes for mashed potatoes, and the fact that no one on the internet will say they’re meant for that. However, I don’t really know if I can connect that to Christmas, especially today. It might be a good idea to think more about it for future musings about family recipes.</p>
<p>Ok so let’s try to make a coherent draft. I still haven’t figured out what I want to muse about. The writing book says that you should spend a few days on this process, but acknowledges that you may not always have the option to do so.</p>
<p>Christmas. What’s it about? No that feels too trite and over done.</p>
<p>Christmas. Fears that I have related to it? Feels too personal to this blog.</p>
<p>Christmas. Why is it so hot out today? Could be good.</p>
<p>Christmas. Changes?</p>
<p>Hmmm. What can we talk about for changes?</p>
<p>There’s the obvious, that the weather is changing as the climate gets worse. There’s the way that family traditions change. There’s the voice in my head that says this might be the last Christmas we have together.<a href="#fn0322" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> There’s the fact that life hasn’t really returned to a stasis since Covid? Idk let’s see what happens if we just go like that.</p>

<h1 id="reflections-on-todays-gospel"><a href="reflections-on-readings-4-advent-b-23.html">Reflections on Today’s Gospel</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 December 24</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>Today is the Fourth Sunday of Advent. It’s a strange set of readings, especially when we look at the readings that we have had for the past few weeks. The first reading, as expected, is a reading from the Old Testament. Unlike most of the other readings, today’s does not come from one of the explicitly prophetic books. Instead, we have an excerpt<a href="#fn041" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> from the Second Book of Samuel. We follow David, who wants to build the Ark of the Covenant a better dwelling place.</p>
<p>Of course, as Catholics, we know that the Ark was a foreshadowing of Mary, who carried the Christ into the world.<a href="#fn042" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> And so, it’s only fitting that the Gospel today focus on Mary. In particular, we see one thread continuing from the time of David the king to the time of Christ the King: The Almighty’s angels. The Angel Gabriel delivers messages both to David and to Mary. And so, in the final hours before Christmas<a href="#fn043" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, I think it’s good to reflect on what Mary said to the Angel of the Most High, “may it be done unto me according to your word.”<a href="#fn044" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> The Pater Noster may be the perfect form of prayer, but Mary’s Fiat<a href="#fn045" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> is bound to be a close second. David wanted to build a fitting home for the Ark, but did not know what to ask.</p>

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>It’s the fourth Sunday of Advent, and it almost feels like Christmas.<a href="#fn049" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Today’s readings were pretty standard “be ready for Christmas” readings. The first reading comes from the Second book of Samuel, where we see David trying to pay homage to his Lord. He looks around, realizing that he lives in a beautiful home, while the Lord is being kept in a tent. The prophet of the day<a href="#fn0410" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> assures him that the Lord will appreciate any efforts that Daniel puts forth.</p>
<p>The Lord, however, comes to Nathan in a dream,<a href="#fn0411" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> and tells him to tell Daniel not to build a temple. More than that, though, the Lord says that he will establish an eternal kingdom from David’s descendants. As Catholics, we know what that kingdom is, and who the heir is. The Gospel, of course, makes that explicit.</p>
<p>The angel<a href="#fn0412" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Gabriel<a href="#fn0413" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> comes to Mary. Importantly, he is the same angel who came to Daniel to interpret his visions. It’s something that very rarely comes up in homilies that I’ve heard, probably for some good reason.</p>
<p>Of course, one reason could very easily just be that the Ave Maria<a href="#fn0414" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> is allegedly a very unpopular prayer among Protestants.<a href="#fn0415" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> The fact that the opening line comes directly from an angel<a href="#fn0416" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> of the Lord should, in theory, help assuage concerns about the prayer. Then again, I don’t know if anyone attending Mass on the Fourth Sunday of Advent<a href="#fn0417" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> needs to be convinced that Mary is a good and holy person, worthy of admiration.<a href="#fn0418" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Advent in general, as the priest today reminded us, is a season focused on Mary. It feels a little strange to me that we only really care about the last month of Mary’s pregnancy, but I suppose that otherwise we’d have to start Advent as soon as Easter ended.<a href="#fn0419" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> I’m sure there’s something to think about in the fact that we only really talk about Christ as a newborn child and as a thirty three year old. It is a little strange to think that, were I Christ, nothing that I’ve really done with my life so far would have been recorded.</p>
<p>Post writing note: I’m not really happy with the musing right now, for all that I don’t really know what else there is to reflect on in the readings. Maybe I should come back to this in a little bit?</p>

<p>First Published: 2023 December 23</p>
<h1 id="draft-3-december-23">Draft 3: December 23</h1>
<p>Holidays are a time to remember. For many, it is a time when the entire family shows up in the same space to share a meal and fellowship. Traditions form as people bond to a specific food or ritual. As older members die and newer people join the family, traditions mutate and change.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, traditions last until they are questioned. I’m reminded of one from my own family, where we used to trim the ends off of each roast before cooking. When we finally reconstructed the narrative, it turned out that the only roasting pan one of the family owned was too small for the roasts. Even as we got larger pans, however, we continued trimming the roast.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I was reminded of this as I prepared the only family recipe I get from my mother’s half of the family. Now, earlier drafts<a href="#fn051" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> focused far more on the specific dish. I think that it’s worth taking a step back and thinking more about what family recipes tell us in general.</p>
<p>Until just a few years ago, for instance, I thought that we had a family recipe for green bean casserole. In some regards we do. We prepare the meal the same way, and it’s a recipe we use for every important meal.<a href="#fn052" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> However, it turns out that the recipe we follow comes directly from the French’s Fried Onion box.</p>
<p>I have read a number of so called family recipes that adapt<a href="#fn053" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> from a recipe book that someone’s mother or grandmother or aunt read. In the times before the internet, it was difficult to source information. If someone brought a dish you liked, asking them for a recipe would not necessarily come with the recipe’s provenance.</p>
<p>Honestly, my mind is blank today, and I do not know what else I could say. I’m sure that there’s more I could muse on, but I don’t know what.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I embroider today? I still haven’t figured out who I’d give the gift to, though I do like the last design I made. It could be fun to just make more letters.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I play guitar today? Just for a moment! It was fun, and I’m starting to enjoy E Major as a chord, for all that I still dislike B Major.<a href="#fn054" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Did I practice touch typing today? I did! I made it through P and am now ready to start on B tomorrow. I was once again stopped on c for a bit, which isn’t fantastic, but it is what it is.</p></li>

<p>Holidays are a time of memories. For many households in modern America, holidays are the one time a year that the entire intergenerational family is under one roof. Flavors and specific preparations can be handed down from the people with the greatest attachment to them. As the oldest members of the family die and younger family members are born, recipes and meal plans change. Sometimes, things continue to be done the same way, simply because there is no need to question the way things are always done.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, someone new<a href="#fn055" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> will ask what the point is of some tradition. I’m reminded of one from my own family, where we used to trim the ends off of each roast before cooking. When we finally reconstructed the narrative, it turned out that the only roasting pan one of the family owned was too small for the roasts. Even as we got larger pans, however, we continued trimming the roast.</p>
<p>In my own household, we have very little of this generational memory. In part, it comes from the fact that many members of my family in recent generations have disowned or been disowned by their relatives.<a href="#fn056" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h1 id="draft-1-december-22">Draft 1: December 22</h1>
<p>Today I made one of<a href="#fn057" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> the family recipes I’ve inherited. We’ve always called it halishki<a href="#fn058" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>: a dish of dropped egg noodles in a chicken and cream sauce. When you google the word, I mostly find a Polish word for a dish with noodles and cabbage in a pork based sauce. There’s more or less nothing in common with my family recipe and that.</p>
<p>However, this presupposes that my family recipe is Polish. We really don’t know where most of my family came from, especially this part of the family. I’ve always been told it was somewhere Slavic, but that really does not narrow it down too much. If we start searching for Polish drop noodles, we find kluski. Wikipedia for kluski takes us to a similar dish in other portions of Eastern Europe, halusky<a href="#fn059" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>. Halusky is small dropped egg noodles, which does accurately describe the dish that I make, for all that it is also described as typically being served with cabbage.</p>
<p>However, I know that many members of my family have been unable to eat cabbage. That could explain the lack of cabbage in the family recipe. At this point, though, I was excited to learn more.</p>
<p>I got the last name<a href="#fn0510" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> of the person we initially got the recipe from.<a href="#fn0511" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> The last name does come from the areas listed in the second Wikipedia article, which is pretty cool. One of the two variant spellings is allegedly Jewish in origin, which is interesting. I’m sure that there’s a fascinating history there that is now lost to the mists of time.</p>
<p>So, what is the family recipe? As far as I can tell, the recipe is more or less just chicken and dumplings in a cream sauce. I don’t see many recipes for chicken and dumplings that call for cream sauce.</p>
<p>How do I make it, though? I think that every time that I have been personally a part of making it<a href="#fn0512" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>, I’ve followed a slightly different recipe. However, this time through I think will be my recipe going forwards.</p>
<p>I started by melting some butter in a large stock pot and then browning some chicken.<a href="#fn0513" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> The goal was really just getting a bit of color on the meat and a touch of fond on the pan. Once the chicken was browned, we put some butter in the pot and then some white onion. Once the onion looked soft, I added in the chicken stock and let it come to a boil.</p>
<p>We made a very simple dumpling dough<a href="#fn0514" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> out of egg, flour, salt, and pepper.<a href="#fn0515" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> We then spoon some portions of the dough<a href="#fn0516" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> into the boiling stock, chop some celery and add it in, and add the chicken<a href="#fn0517" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> back. From there, I let it simmer covered fora bout an hour, and then uncovered it to let the stock reduce a fair amount. Just before serving, we taste the broth for seasoning, and then add cream to taste and texture.</p>
<p>This time around, we made a huge recipe of it, which should be really nice for leftovers. Historically, it’s tasted far better the next day, as all of the flavors have had time to meld together.</p>
<p>Post Script:</p>
<p>As I look at the past six hundred words, I realize that I want to focus more on the family recipe aspect than the specific recipe we followed. Let’s see how that goes, moving from the specific case to more of a general one?<a href="#fn0518" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<h1 id="flash-fiction-friday"><a href="flash-fiction-232.html">Flash Fiction Friday</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 December 22</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Another Friday, which means it’s time to try to answer another prompt. The prompt this week is among any option. I had no idea how to respond to this prompt, and reading the description didn’t make the prompt any more sensible. However, it did give me some ideas.</p>
<p>The prompt implies a choice. If we keep that in mind, then the prompt shifts to choosing between any option. What could be a good response for that prompt?</p>
<p>My mind is falling immediately to love, but I have to wonder how much of that is just me choosing a new creative rut. I think that the last few times that I’ve written a FFF, it’s been about romance of some sort. What else could we set as a number of choices?</p>
<p>I mean basically anything can be a set of choices, which makes this prompt feel almost too broad. I guess that more or less any writing I produce will be good for the prompt. A part of me really doesn’t like that, though, because part of my ideal for prompts is that it constrains my writing.</p>
<p>So, where else does my mind immediately go?</p>
<p>Given that we did a family recipe for dinner<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, I’m finding that I’m thinking about choosing foods. As the new Percy Jackson television series<a href="#fn062" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> is coming out, there’s choices about media we consume, hero’s choices, and the like. Since we play board games as a family, the idea of what game to play comes up a lot.</p>
<p>The hero’s choices feel like something that I want to interact with. What do heroes do? Or, rather, what terrible choice could a hero be forced into?<a href="#fn063" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>I’m still circling around the idea of romance, which may be something that I could do?</p>
<p>So, we have a hero<a href="#fn064" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> who needs to make a choice. Maybe there’s something to say about like deciding between the person you love and the work you need to do? Alright, how can we frame it in a way that hasn’t been done to death a million times?</p>
<p>Or, just as much in the choice, how do we do what we want to do with our full self, ignoring all the self doubt and negative self talk?</p>
<p>A hero has a choice. How explicit do I need to make that? I think that at this point I really need to focus on the writing, which means I need to stop writing about writing and start actually writing.<a href="#fn065" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Actually, wait, let’s think about the normal questions we have. Do I want to have first or third person? I don’t really know. I think that we should write it and see what happens.</p>
<p>Ok so about five hundred words of writing later, I find that I got too far from the prompt. I more or less wrote a retrospective, ten years later. I think that I focused too much on the retrospective, rather than the actual set of choices. Maybe I could do something looking forwards instead?</p>
<p>Ooh, I actually really like the FFF I wrote. Let’s see if there’s anything I can do to spice it up for take three, but if not, I am actually going to be ok with it. I assume that I’ll see something that I want to change, but you never know until you try.</p>
<p>Ooh, wow, the revision is way stronger, I think. I more or less replaced every word, which is kind of funny when you think about it. The scene played out more or less the same, though, which is interesting. I do still feel like I rushed the ending, which is more and more something I realize I struggle with. The ending of a story always seems to come too quickly, and I don’t quite know how to wrap it<a href="#fn066" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> up satisfyingly.</p>
<p>All this to say, good night.</p>

<h1 id="thewords-review"><a href="4thewords.html">4thewords Review</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 December 21</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>I’ve talked a fair amount in these musings about the new site I’m using for writing. As I’ve mentioned on more than a few occasions, I often have trouble motivating myself to write.<a href="#fn071" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> You may have also noticed recently that I’ve more or less been able to put out a post basically every day. There’s a few reasons for that.</p>
<p>I’ve been writing every morning with a friend, for one. I found an internal reason to write daily, for another. Both of those, however, are why I am able to write a blog post every day, not how. Today, I’d really like to spend some time discussing how I’ve been able to write so much more.</p>
<p>Since apparently mid august, I’ve been using a website called 4thewords.<a href="#fn072" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> I guess that knowing I’ve been using it since August doesn’t exactly lend credence to the idea that it helps me write. However, it is working now.</p>
<p>So, what is 4thewords, and how does it motivate me to write more?</p>
<p>4thewords is a few things bundled into one. It is a fairly lightweight word processor<a href="#fn073" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. There’s a fairly active and incredibly positive forum. And, its real selling point, 4thewords is also an RPG.<a href="#fn074" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>That is, you play as a character exploring through the world, completing quests and getting rewards. Like many RPG<a href="#fn075" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>, 4thewords also lets you decorate your character, both with stat boosting and completely cosmetic items. In what I think is a really brilliant choice, they have completely separated the two. That is, you can choose to equip the best equipment for statistics without compromising on your artistic vision.</p>
<p>At this point, you might be wondering how they manage to combine a word processor with an RPG. Most quests are completed by fighting monsters. Monsters are fought by writing words against a time limit. Unlike in a lot of RPG, there is generally no way for the monsters to strike back.</p>
<p>Most of the monsters require a certain number of words written within a given number of minutes. They tend not to require a pace faster than ten words per minute, which is nice when doing something slower than free writing. Even when I’m at my most type a few words and delete, I still average more than ten words typed a minute. There are a few monsters which are called endurance monsters. Rather than requiring a certain number of words, it requires a constant clip. I generally dislike them, because I’m more motivated by “here’s the number of words you have left” than “this is the amount of time you have left.”</p>
<p>However, fighting does not an RPG make. Another important aspect of an RPG is items. Most RPG have both decorative and functional items. 4thewords is no different.</p>
<p>Unlike more RPG, however, the form and function are completely separated. You can choose to equip whatever items give you the stats you want along with whatever items give you the appearance you want. Both sets of items are purchased in the in game stores for mostly in game available items, which you can get by fighting monsters and finishing quests.</p>
<p>Functional items feel a little strange in a game like this. It seems odd that a game where the only combat is writing words within a timeline would have items that affect the gameplay. And, thankfully, there are only three stats: attack, defense, and luck.</p>
<p>Attack follows a formula, where the higher your attack, the fewer words it takes to take down a monster. It doesn’t change the stated numbers, but two words might count for three. Defense increases the amount of time that you have to fight a monster. Unlike attack, it does change the number of seconds that you have to write. A second still lasts exactly<a href="#fn076" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Finally, there is luck, which nominally affects the drops that a monster gives. There’s some variance to what monsters can drop, though there is usually a floor and a ceiling, and the two numbers are not always different.</p>
<p>So, why do I feel like this app helps me write?</p>
<p>I think that there are a few reasons.</p>
<p>First and foremost, I like the fact that there are a series of small goals that I can set to automatically start. Writing 500 words is often a reasonable amount for me at once. Especially if I’m writing quickly, I can generally get through one in about ten minutes. Small monsters, with around 100 words to complete, give an almost constant source of dopamine.</p>
<p>After writing two paragraphs, I tend to take a break for a second or so, because my mind needs a little bit of time to process what I said. Four paragraphs is almost always at least 100 words, which means that after I write them, I get another monster.</p>
<p>The time also helps. Without deadlines, I find that I procrastinate almost indefinitely. Every so often, I’ll look and see that there’s only two minutes left to write 100 words, or twenty minutes left to write 1000. When that happens, I put my nose to the metphorical grindstone and start working as hard as I can to get the words out.</p>
<p>Those two facts do a lot to help motivate me to write. However, there are also a lot of small little features on the site that make it more friendly for me. The overall design is fairly unobtrusive, which means that I’m not horribly distracted while I write. However, the overall design is also very bright, which makes it fun, and I get pretty pictures to cheer me up.</p>
<p>Also, the site is explicit that their goal is helping users to meet their own writing goals. Unlike some sites, which track incredibly hard to make sure that no one is doing anything that could even begin to think of cheating. Even though there are some community aspects to the game, it’s almost exclusively single player. Because of that, the developers are very clear that you should use the site however works best for you.</p>
<p>For some people, that means copy pasting a few hundred words of lorem ipsum after they’ve done some editing or chores. Personally, I tend not to copy paste, though I’ve started thinking of situations where I feel better about it.<a href="#fn077" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> There are also almost no negative consequences in the game. Losing a monster doesn’t affect you in any way except for a single tally somewhere fairly hidden in the game.<a href="#fn078" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> I find that negative consequences can make me want to avoid a situation, and so the absence makes it nice.</p>
<p>And, finally, the game is in active development! I don’t mean that in the way of “the site is full of bugs and major gameplay changes happen daily”, but in the “the developers clearly care about they’re doing, and they add lots of new and exciting seasonal events.” Right now, we’re in the middle of the winter wonderland, which has a few time limited monsters and some special snow themed quests. Just before that, however, was a really exciting quest series for NaNoWriMo!</p>
<p>Anyways, if this inspires you to try the application<a href="#fn079" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> at all, please reach out.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I embroider today? Shoot! Tomorrow for sure.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I play guitar today? Shoot! Tomorrow or tonight for sure.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I practice touch typing today? I made it past c for a second, and then got back to it. I think that right now my struggle letters are r, which I want to type with my ring finger, y, which I want to type with my left hand, and c, which I want to type with my index finger. Since I haven’t gotten all of the letters unlocked, it’s more than likely that other letters (like p) will be an issue.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Reading</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have I made progress on my Currently Reading Shelf? I finished the second book with a friend and started the third. However, I did read both of the books that I wanted to finish this month, I think.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I read the book on craft? I have it, and may remember to do tonight, will keep posted.</p></li>
<li><p>Have I read the library books? Still shoot. I have them with me, though, so may read tomorrow.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write a sonnet? I did not write one two days ago, and yesterday’s was mediocre. Hopefully I remember to write today’s before I’m too tired for it.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I revise a sonnet? Somehow when I’m tired I write sonnets thoughtlessly. That’s probably because I don’t care if the rhyme feels forced or if the story makes no sense.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? Hooray!</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write ahead on Jeb? I’m about one third through tomorrow’s chapter, so will try to do more in the next few hours.</p></li>
<li><p>Letter to friends? I played real life pathfinder with some friends<a href="#fn0710" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>, and I got coffee with a dear friend!</p></li>
<li><p>Paper? I was grateful not to be an experimentalist today.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Wellness</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How well did I pray? Yeah oof remains accurate.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I spend my time well? Once again with family! Today also with friends, and that’s great.</p></li>

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>I know that I’ve talked a fair amount in my daily reflections about the site that I’ve started using. Since I don’t know if I’ve explicitly named the site, I use 4thewords, which is a site that tries to gamify writing. The central concept of the game is that you choose to fight monsters, which come with a set number of words and time to defeat them. By and large, this is not terribly difficult. Most of the monsters require around 10 words per minute in order to defeat them.</p>
<p>Of course, like all good RPG<a href="#fn0711" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>, there are stat boosting items. In the case of 4thewords, there are three stats: attack, defense, and luck. I’ve listed them in that order in large part because that’s the order that they’re relevant to me. Attack means that each word you write has a greater effect on the monster you’re fighting<a href="#fn0712" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>. The site gives vague approximations, but the fan site gives the explicit formula.</p>
<p>The words it takes to kill a monster are its default words times one hundred divided by one hundred plus your attack. So, one hundred attack means that it takes half the words to defeat a monster that it claims it should. The part of me that remembers math tells me that n divided by n plus x shrinks very slowly. I think they call it exponential decay. That makes sense, because in order to halve the words again, you would need three hundred attack, and then seven hundred, and so on.</p>
<p>Defense, unsurprisingly, does a similar thing. Defense increases the amount of time that you have to fight the monster. Although it will still say the same amount of time when its waiting in the queue,<a href="#fn0713" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> when the monster fight starts, the timer will show a greater amount of time. I prefer that to seconds not ticking down at the same rate, if only because I like to be able to use the timer as an egg timer of sorts.<a href="#fn0714" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> There’s a similar equation somewhere, though I have not looked it up.<a href="#fn0715" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Finally, we have luck. As this is an RPG, monsters drop loot when they die. Luck affects the amount of loot that is dropped, though last time I checked, it was less clear exactly what the mechanism is for that. Unlike with attack and defense, there is an optimal value for luck.<a href="#fn0716" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Now, I’ve been saying monster in the generic term. There are a lot of unique, hand drawn monsters.<a href="#fn0717" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> One question that you might have is which monster to kill.</p>
<p>I’m actually realizing that I’m falling way too far into the weeds. Let’s restart, this time focusing more on the fact that I want this to be a review.</p>

<h1 id="on-why-versus-how"><a href="why-versus-how.html">On Why Versus How</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 December 20</p>
<h1 id="draft-5">Draft 5</h1>
<p>Why and how feel like such close questions. And yet, there is an unseen gulf of meaning between the two. Far too often, we stop the mind from looking upward by focusing it downward.</p>
<p>Why asks the reason, the cause, the philosophical reason that something is. How, by contrast, asks the mechanism, the physical description of what is. That is, why is to metaphysics what how is to physics.<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Children are always gazing upward, considering the nature of the world.<a href="#fn082" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Children ask why the world is the way it is, not how it is. When we tell them that the world is the way it is because of history, that reduces all of creation to a series of forced events. We lose agency in this world.</p>
<p>Why is the sky blue? Rayleigh scattering is true, but it is how the sky is blue. Rayleigh scattering explains that some light is diffracted differently.<a href="#fn083" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> If physics is all that makes the sky blue, then there must not be anything more than physics, is what our minds are lead to believe. By answering questions of why with how language, we fall into the trap of scientism.</p>
<p>More than that, though, we fall into an issue endemic to computer science. Computer scientists are famous for creating solutions to problems without considering the secondary effects, or the reasons the problems may exist. The most famous example that I can think of is a Stanford student who found that when you challenge a parking ticket, most jurisdictions will just drop the charge, because it isn’t worth the hassle to fight it. So, the student wrote an app to automatically contest all parking tickets.</p>
<p>Deep down, the question being asked was how do parking tickets work, not why do they exist. I think that we can all agree it is generally better to not park in disabled spaces<a href="#fn084" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> or in front of fire hydrants. This why and how can also lead to an intellectual stagnation.</p>
<p>Let’s take the example of the research that my group does. We look for the origins of life in star forming regions. From now on, each statement will have an implicit how question attached to it.</p>
<p>We use telescopes such as ALMA and NOEMA to measure the radio frequencies emitted from star forming regions and tie them to specific molecular transitions.</p>
<p>We have catalogs of molecular line information, which we can assign to the spectra coming from space.</p>
<p>We can purchase molecules and collect their rotational spectra.</p>
<p>We can shine known wavelengths of light on known molecules and detect whether or not the molecule absorbs at that wavelength.</p>
<p>We can see a change in voltage, which is directly correlated to the change in light.</p>
<p>Notice how even here, we’ve fallen almost completely away from the actual research goal of searching for the origins of life in star forming regions. All of the how questions are absolutely essential, because without answers, we would not be able to measure transitions or assign them. However, imagine if instead we start asking why.</p>
<p>I’m going to work backwards.</p>
<p>We can see a change in voltage, which is directly correlated to the change in light. (Why?) The software we use is designed to function with an instrument that has a variable resistor. It measures changes in photons as changes in temperature as changes in resistance. V=IR, so that can make a change in I or V if you hold the other constant. (Why?) It’s a detector very similar to the ones that astronomers use? (Why?) Calibrating based on temperature is easier?<a href="#fn085" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>We can shine known wavelengths of light on known molecules and detect whether or not the molecule absorbs at that wavelength. (Why?) We want to know what frequencies the molecule absorbs light at. (Why?) When we know what frequencies the molecule absorbs light at, we can assign its spectra using a limited number of rotational constants. (Why?) Rotational transitions are low energy, which means that a lot of the cold regions of space still have active populations in multiple rotational states, which allows us to quantify temperature and density. (Why?) Knowing what space is like helps us to model it, and can help us learn where we come from. (Hey look we got to the question of origins)</p>
<p>We can purchase molecules and collect their rotational spectra. I feel like this one follows the same train of thought.</p>
<p>We have catalogs of molecular line information, which we can assign to the spectra coming from space. This one follows the same starting from “rotational transitions are low energy”.</p>
<p>So, one thing that I notice is that how questions lead me deeper into the subject, reducing the scope of the question, while why questions bring me higher. There is absolutely a space for both, and I think that both are needed. The ideal is to have feel firmly anchored on the ground and a head floating in the clouds, after all.<a href="#fn086" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>It is important to look deeper at the question. Physics as a field is built on the concept of reductionism. For all that it has limits, as every other method of discovery does, it is an incredibly powerful tool when applied correctly.</p>
<p>However, the same is true for why. Without motivating the work we do, there is no way to connect it to others. Since all that we do is for the greater glory of G-d, and we are called to bring all creation to Him, we need everything we do to be in connection to the rest of the world, especially the rest of humanity.<a href="#fn087" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<h1 id="draft-4">Draft 4</h1>
<p>I often find myself considering language. There are a lot of reasons for it, as I come to realize more and more with each passing year. One of the more common issues that I find myself considering is the shade of difference between similar words. Two of these words are “why” and “how”.<a href="#fn089" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>So, what is the difference between these two words?</p>
<p>Why is focused on the reason behind an act, and how focuses on the process behind it. This distinction, for all that it took me far too long to find, rather than simply looking it up, is a somewhat subtle one. Often, we treat the words as interchangeable.</p>
<p>For example, think of that most basic scientific question: “why is the sky blue?”</p>
<p>Most often, we answer this with mechanistic answers. The sky is blue, we explain, because of rayleigh scattering<a href="#fn0810" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>, or because air is blue<a href="#fn0811" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>, or any of a number of other answers. That is, we tell children how the sky is blue.</p>
<p>Why is that a problem?</p>
<p>I think that it’s a subtle thing. By answering questions where someone looks for a reason with a mechanism, we start to point to mechanisms as reasons themselves. That is, the world we create when why questions are answered with how lacks transcendence.<a href="#fn0812" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> When we see the world as nothing but a machine, moving thoughtlessly along, we feel as though actions cease to matter. After all, if the why is the how, then free will makes no sense.</p>
<p>We can look and see the issue from the opposite perspective. If we answer a how question with a why answer, we fall down to fundamentalism.</p>
<p>How do we celebrate Hanukkah?<a href="#fn0813" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>We celebrate Hanukkah because Hashem preserved the Jewish people before, and He will continue to do so in the future.</p>
<p>I don’t know if that quite works. It feels almost like a non sequitor, and I realize now that there are ways to frame the question that start from a science question, rather than a religious point.</p>
<p>How does a computer program work? We write computer programs to make life easier. We can, hmm no.</p>
<p>By adding the work at the end of the sentence, you cannot really substitute a why.</p>
<p>How do we use computers?</p>
<p>Computers make life easier because they can do a lot of math really quickly. As it turns out, problems which are easy for people to solve tend to involve concepts, while questions that are easy for computers to solve tend to involve caluclations.</p>
<p>That doesn’t answer the question. I think that this is showing me my own bias. I have a far easier time accepting that a process explains a reason than that a reason explains a process. Then again, I find myself incredibly uncomfortable with fundamentalism as a concept. What do I mean by fundamentalism?</p>
<p>That’s a fantastic question. Fundamentalism is answering how questions with a why. When finding the way that something works, we can always delve deeper.</p>
<p>How does rotational spectroscopy work? Molecules rotate.</p>
<p>How do molecules form? Atoms bond.</p>
<p>How do they bond/how are they formed? You see, we can go on and on.</p>
<p>If we answer “how do molecules form” with “because it is favorable for them to do so”<a href="#fn0814" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>, we shift the question from mechanisms to reasons. Actually, as I think about it, the framing of an answer is often the difference between why and how. Why do molecules bond? It’s energetically favorable. How do they bond? Two atoms draw close enough that they release energy by drawing closer.</p>
<p>I don’t think that’s the point I’m trying to make, though. Let’s try one last time, focusing entirely on the whole “using a how to answer a why kills belief in greater workings and makes the world as though automata.”</p>
<h1 id="draft-3">Draft 3</h1>
<p>One question that children stereotypically ask is “why?”.<a href="#fn0815" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> One question that children ask far less often<a href="#fn0816" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> is how. To be honest, I think that the lack of distinction in children’s questions is the start of every issue that we have in communication.<a href="#fn0817" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>Think about explaining grass as green, either because it reflects green light, or because it has chlorophyll. Each of those answers would satisfy the question of either why or how grass is green. And yet, to me, at least, these two sets of responses feel different. If they don’t to you, this musing is only downhill from here. Be forewarned.</p>
<p>So, what is the difference between why and how?</p>
<p>In basic terms, I generally feel like how is looking within, while why looks without. Or, how asks the mechanism by which something operates. Why assumes that there’s a broader meaning to it.</p>
<p>Is that all, though?</p>
<p>If so, it does lend credence to the idea that why questions are questions of faith, while<a href="#fn0818" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> how questions are questions of science. This definition, of course, relies on science being defined as a mechanistic search for the way that the universe functions, while faith is concerned with understanding the reasons which make the universe.<a href="#fn0819" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>Something that I keep needing to remind myself is that there needs to be a takeaway from whatever I write. Given that I don’t know what the point of this musing. I guess we can ask the two questions of this musing?</p>
<p>Why am I writing this musing?</p>
<p>I am writing this musing because I have a vague sense of dis-ease<a href="#fn0820" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> about the difference between the words, their meaning, and their use. The two words need to be different, if only because they are different words.</p>
<p>Why else?</p>
<p>I don’t think that there’s a deeper meaning to this musing, at least yet. So, let’s assume that the why has been covered.</p>
<p>How am I writing this musing?</p>
<p>I’m writing this musing by making different drafts of the musing. I’m writing this musing by trying to think about what I think the differences are. I’m writing this musing by figuring out what I think the words mean in connection to other words.</p>
<p>Any other ways that I’m writing this musing? I honestly think that may be it. That’s how I’m writing it.</p>
<p>So I guess the way that I responded to the questions confirms my thoughts about how they differ. Why does seem to point to meaning, and how seems to point to methods. Great.</p>
<p>Let’s move past that though. That last sentence in the how feels striking to me. Words have meaning almost exclusively in how they relate to other words.</p>
<p>When we answer a why question with a how answer, or a how question with a why answer, we do a disservice to others. Or, instead, let’s take the other view. Most of the people that I know do not care so much about the precise usage of language. Instead of saying that the rest of the world is wrong, let us see if I cannot find a way that I can shift my own views of language.</p>
<p>After all, as Randall Munroe once pointed out, language and communication requires two people. What is different about the language that others use where this does not feel like an issue? Only now, twenty five hundred words later, do I feel like it is a good time to look up and see if there’s anything that others would think</p>
<p>Oh gosh <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/5563/how-come-vs-why">someone</a> pointed out that why and how come have the same usage, though how come is less formal. If we put it into my framework, how come is also a mechanistic explanation? I think? Honestly, I don’t know how I feel about it. Oh good, the rest of the internet generally agrees with me that the difference is between process and reason.</p>
<p>I feel really dissatisfied with this end of musing, however. Why? Because I kind of feel like I’ve gotten nowhere after all these words. How? I have failed to answer the question, which is difference in usage.</p>
<p>I probably have time for one more draft. Let’s do everything in our power to focus exclusively on why I think it’s a problem that we answer process questions with reason answers or vice versa. I’m sure that there’s a reason if I stop to think about it.</p>
<h1 id="draft-2.5-metawriting-to-figure-out-how-i-feel">Draft 2.5: metawriting to figure out how I feel</h1>
<p>Why do I muse?</p>
<p>I have talked about this a number of times. In short, I muse because I find it helpful to my life and growth as a person.</p>
<p>How do I muse?</p>
<p>I don’t think I’ve ever explicitly thought about this. This question can be answered in so many ways, with varying levels of granularity.</p>
<p>I muse by posting my thoughts on the blog. I muse by coming up with an idea, writing about it, revising it<a href="#fn0821" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>, and then posting it. I muse by typing words on a digital page. I muse by having thoughts and expressing them.</p>
<p>Why do I hurt?<a href="#fn0822" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>I made a mistake while working out. I fell down. I don’t stretch enough.</p>
<p>How do I hurt?</p>
<p>My leg aches, or my arm feels like daggers are being driven into it.</p>
<p>Does that help me?</p>
<p>Why is causal? Like why presumes a reason, while how just explains mechanisms?</p>
<p>Why is grass green?</p>
<p>Because it doesn’t absorb green light. That’s mechanistic.</p>
<p>Because it’s filled with chlorophyll, which is green. That’s also still a mechanism.</p>
<p>How is grass green?</p>
<p>Because it doesn’t absorb green light. Because it’s filled with chlorophyll, which is green.</p>
<p>Somehow, despite the fact that both of those answers are the same, it still feels vastly different to me. I don’t actually know if there’s anything more that I can say about that. Let’s try, though.</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>I’ve been thinking recently about the difference between why and how. The two words have to be different<a href="#fn0823" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>, but I’ve been struggling to figure out in what way.<a href="#fn0824" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>How feels like something descriptive. That is, I figure out how to end a sentence, because I already know that I’m going to end a sentence. Why, on the other hand, feels prescriptive. If I am figuring out why to end a sentence, it is because I don’t know what its purpose is.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s the way to figure out the difference between how and why: write a few sentences that could use either word and see the way that the meaning changes.<a href="#fn0825" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>I’m going to restart this musing, and I will try my best to use either word only intentionally.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>While writing my reflection on the readings, I mentioned faith like a child. As I drove to religious ed, I thought about faith like a child, and I thought about faith and science. One half formed memory I have<a href="#fn0826" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> was that the difference between faith and science is which questions they seek to answer. Science seeks to answer how, while religion seeks to answer why.</p>
<p>Of course, I then immediately thought about the question that a young child asks. Children do not<a href="#fn0827" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> ask how. They ask why. When a child asks why the sky is blue, however, we tend to give how answers.</p>
<p>That bothered me, for a reason that I’m going to try to work through here in this musing.</p>
<p>Ok, so the most obvious bother is that if the difference between why and how is science and faith, and the two live in different domains, then it’s wrong to answer a why with a how. Now that I’ve expressed the concern, I can set it aside.<a href="#fn0828" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>I’ll trust that the sentence above describes my concern. At least one of those claims is untrue, so let’s list them.<a href="#fn0829" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Explicit: there is a difference between science and faith</p></li>
<li><p>Explicit: science answers how questions</p></li>
<li><p>Explicit: faith answers why questions</p></li>
<li><p>Explicit: the two have different domains</p></li>
<li><p>Explicit: you should answer how with how and why with why</p></li>
<li><p>Implicit: you should answer the question that people asked, not what you want to answer</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Are there other claims? I don’t really think so.<a href="#fn0830" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> There may be, however, so I’ll be willing to add to the list if I need to.</p>
<p>Alright, let’s try to answer the claims one at a time, and see if we can’t find the one that isn’t ringing in tune.</p>
<p>There is a difference between science and faith. No, that’s absolutely true. For all that I’ve talked about how science and mysticism are intrinsically linked, the method of discovering knowledge is inherently different. Science is different than math is different than faith.</p>
<p>By that, I mean that science gains knowledge<a href="#fn0831" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> by measuring and reproducing measurements. Mathematics generates knowledge by testing hypotheses using logic. Faith generates knowledge by divine revelation.</p>
<p>Oh! A claim in there is that why and how are fundamentally different questions. There we go, that’s the sticking point that I have right now.</p>
<p>So let’s see what the difference is between the two. How describes process, while why ascribes meaning? That feels kind of resonant.</p>
<p>That is, how is a descriptive thing, while why is a prescriptive. Ok, that does also work with the difference between faith and science, so let’s run with that take. Now then, what’s wrong with answering why questions with how or vice versa?</p>
<p>Ok, let’s remove the explicit case of the children’s question. Let’s look at the election.</p>
<p>Why do we have a president?</p>
<p>We have a president because we set up a system wherein we elect someone to run the country. That is a why answer to a why question. Oh, yeah, no, that’s definitely the issue.</p>
<p>When a kid asks why the sky is blue, we treat it as though they’re asking how the sky is blue. The sky is blue because air is blue.<a href="#fn0832" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> But, why is the sky blue? That’s a much more difficult question to answer. Honestly, there isn’t an answer that I know of for why the sky is blue, other than the fact that the universe was created in such a way to cause the sky to be blue.</p>
<p>What are other questions that children stereotypically ask?</p>
<p>When a child asks why we have to go to school, on the other hand, we do give them a prescriptive answer. We have to go to school because it’s good to learn, or something.<a href="#fn0833" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>Ok, so I guess my issue is really just with the answer to why the sky is blue. That is, however the only children’s question about science that I can think of.</p>
<p>Oh, wait.</p>
<p>Why is grass green? That sounds like something that a child would ask.</p>
<p>We can answer that descriptively <a href="#fn0834" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a>. Can we answer that prescriptively?</p>
<p>If not, does that show me the issue? Is there a way to frame scientific questions that are why based, rather than how based?</p>
<p>Ooh, that may very well be the issue that I have right now.</p>
<p>Is how is grass green a different question than why is grass green?</p>
<p>On the face of it, yes?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Grass is green because of chlorophyll</p></li>
<li><p>Grass is green because it preferentially reflects or emits green light<a href="#fn0835" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Yeah that’s about it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Why?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Because that’s the best wavelength to absorb light for energy<a href="#fn0836" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Because it was made to be green.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>I guess those are shades of different meaning, for all that I cannot really point to anything specific about it. However, what is the difference between a child’s response to each of those?</p>
<p>If we assume that a child is an automaton, the child will ask why in response to everything else.</p>
<p>So: Grass is green because of chlorophyll. Why?</p>
<p>Because grass gets its color from chlorophyll. Why?</p>
<p>Because there’s a lot of chlorophyll in grass. Why?</p>
<p>Ok I can’t find a good way to continue from there.</p>
<p>Grass is green because it emits green light. Why?</p>
<p>Because chlorophyll emits green light, and that’s what looks green. Why?</p>
<p>Because that’s the best wavelength to gain energy. Why?</p>
<p>Because the sun emits light across a whole wavelength, maximizing at the green. Why?</p>
<p>Because something something quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Ok that’s also not great. That also does cover the actual why answer, which is slowly leading me to the actual issue I have. Despite the fact that I have different senses of the meaning, my impulse is to answer the why questions more or less interchangeably.</p>
<p>What can I do with this?</p>
<p>I think I might have fallen too far into the weeds. Let’s pull back and re evaluate.</p>

As the resident librarian put it “She has written so many objectively twisted but deeply compelling plots”)). Wild how my memory links. Also, now that I’m down the rabbit hole, wow early 2000s child lit was filled with a lot of wild dystopian literature. Then again, I also read Octavia Butler’s Wild Seed, which though not children’s lit (I think) or from the early 2000s, was still messed up. Ok back to the real musing (but new idea just dropped). Also I need to reread and then write about the Patternist series, because there’s so much in there that’s immediately relevant to modern political discourse.<a href="#fn08ref26" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

Most of the time, I’m on team line break after each sentence (since a professor taught me how much easier it made editing and seeing edits), which LaTeX ignores (I don’t know if the many conversions I use will break if I try to have special formatting for the word, so I’m going to pretend that the normal orthography (which may or may not be the proper term, depending on how important the positioning of letters is to the meaning of the word) is acceptable). However, every so often I find that I have two sentences that feel like a single thought, and so get to use a single line. Also most footnotes tend to be a single line, which makes me think that I really do use line breaks to signal thought shifts.

<h1 id="on-being-seen"><a href="being-seen.html">On Being Seen</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 December 19</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>I find that it’s always interesting to learn how others see me. I’d like to think that my own self image of myself hasn’t changed over the years, for all that I know that it has. Without delving too deeply into those, it’s been a long and fun journey to really feel like myself in my own skin, which is something I’m glad for.</p>
<p>But, this musing isn’t about how I see myself. It’s about how others see me. I recently realized, after a few conversations, that the way I am perceived is far different than it once was.</p>
<p>Through high school, I think that I was seen mostly as a member of my family. That’s fair, and that hasn’t really changed.<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> However, that was mostly among people who were, if not friends, then at least one link from a friend or family member. When people saw me not as a member of my family, I know that one of the most common thoughts was that I looked like a football player.<a href="#fn092" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Even through college, those were both common statements a common statement. More than that, though, I know that I was often viewed as someone who enjoyed violent sports.<a href="#fn093" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> The other day, though, I was at a rugby field with some graduate school friends, I made a comment about how I was considering trying rugby.<a href="#fn094" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> The friends I was with both expressed surprise, which made sense to me, at first.</p>
<p>After all, I have never once expressed interest in rugby before, as far as they knew.<a href="#fn095" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>However, that was not where the confusion lay. My friends both expressed shock that I would be interested in a physical<a href="#fn096" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> sport.<a href="#fn097" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>That made me curious. I realized that many of the people I’ve met since starting graduate school express surprise when I tell them that people used to think of me as physically intimidating. I’m only now<a href="#fn098" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> realizing that this might have been less an expression of how friendly I am, and more a reflection of a change in the way that I’m generally viewed.</p>
<p>The next day, a friend was apparently talking about me to someone who didn’t know me. My friend described me with many of the common descriptors.<a href="#fn099" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Someone who knew both my friend and the new person commented that I have a nice smile.</p>
<p>I did smile when I heard that.</p>
<p>I don’t disagree with the idea that I have a nice smile.<a href="#fn0910" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> However, I know that in high school, I was very uncomfortable with my smile. I would do everything in my power to avoid smiling in photos. It does make it a little awkward to show photos of high school me to friends now, though.</p>
<p>Returning to the point, I’m realizing that the way I am perceived frequently differs from the way that people in my life say that they perceive me. I’m sure that there’s some introspection I can do about that, and may in the future.<a href="#fn0911" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I embroider today? I did a single stitch so I wouldn’t lose the embroidery needle. I then remembered to take it with me.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I play guitar today? I packed it, which is nice.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I practice touch typing today? Maybe I should delete this goal.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Reading</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have I made progress on my Currently Reading Shelf? I finished the book that I was listening to! And then I finished the first book in a series with a friend.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I read the book on craft? No, but I packed it!<a href="#fn0912" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Have I read the library books? I found a bunch more books that I want to read, which is sort of the opposite of progress.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write a sonnet? Yesterday’s musing was well received. Today, hopefully I’ll get one.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I revise a sonnet? Had so many false starts yesterday.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? I mused, at least.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write ahead on Jeb? I wrote about half a chapter. Hopefully I’ll be awake enough to write a little more before bed. Otherwise, will finish the chapter in the morning.</p></li>
<li><p>Letter to friends? Very no. Visited a friend, though!</p></li>
<li><p>Paper? I realized that I never actually did the calculation to figure out how distortion constants play with the normal numbers, but wow I do not know how matrices work.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Wellness</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How well did I pray? Still bad.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I clean my space? I made so much progress!</p></li>
<li><p>Did I spend my time well? Yeah! I did good.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? Whoops! Maybe tomorrow.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I exercise? Nope!</p></li>
<li><p>Water? I tried talking a few times today, and then chugged a bottle of water because I was thirsty.</p></li>
