<p>First Published: 2025 September 16</p>
<h1 id="draft-4-16-september-2025">Draft 4: 16 September 2025</h1>
<p>One of those I hold dearest and nearest to my heart recently posted a consideration<a href="#fn001" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> about wanting to be less connected to telephones and occupy time more mindfully in general. I too, wish that I was less attached to screens and more present in my day to day. Even had my dearest friend not posted the consideration, though, I think that i might have come to this folly on my own. As I have been mentioning, I’m on a train, and have been now for more than a full calendar day. Something about the nature of riding a train feels almost designed to foster mindful usage of time.</p>
<p>In part, I think it is because of the fundamentally intentional nature of riding a train. Unlike cars, who nominally follow lanes, or planes which do so solely out of agreement, trains can only run on a single path. There do exist depots to change lines, but they are few and far between. The route I ride is not one which is being chosen by the train conductor; it was chosen by the backs of countless men whose labor built the rails through the empire.</p>
<p>Even more than that, though, the train is filled with windows. Each moment is a new vista. Each blink misses some ineffable piece of a beautiful reality.</p>
<p>Travel by train is also not perfectly smooth. As the train rides along, there are gentle hills and vales, bumps and turns. Each one is an invitation to remember that time, like the train passes by.</p>
<p>Finally, travel by train is fundamentally opposed to the modern optimization and multitasking model. Trains move around the speed of a car, though slightly slower usually. That is, they move far slower than a plane. Also unlike a plane, the trains I have been on do not have any WiFi connections. I’ve been in dead zones which last hours on end, and so there is no way for me to ignore my present with the allure of the online.</p>
<p>These past few weeks, I have found myself living minimally. That is, I have been making few decisions, and generally letting the flow of life move me along. I play games because they occupy my time. Partially as a response to my reflection last night, I came into this morning wanting to be more mindful of the passage of time. I think I can call it a success, given that I’ve written more than two drafts of a musing, bound a book, read eleven chapters of my web novel, three chapters of <em>Musicking</em>, and meditated for forty minutes.<a href="#fn002" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> It is not yet 1500, meaning that I still have more than 9 hours with which to continue to use the day.</p>
<p>Why, though, have I been living minimally?</p>
<p>Computer and phone screens are optimized and designed to draw me in. The quick rush of scrolling or watching a screen go boom are engaging to base parts of myself, and that’s something that I cannot control. This is not to let myself off, however.</p>
<p>What is to let myself off is the realization that it’s been two weeks since I finished the paperwork for my doctorate. Fourteen days to recenter after decades of schooling feels reasonable to me. However, fourteen days feels like enough, at least today. I know that I am most happy with my memories in days and weeks where I pushed myself. Never do I look back on days where I was gentle with myself and be happy for it; the most I can do is accept that it was likely necessary to rest.</p>
<p>So, in the interest of being more mindful, I look at my daily reflection. In general, the one I’ve struggled most with is the idea of not looking at screens. For whatever reason, I can often read for far longer on a phone or computer than I can with physical books. I can also write for far longer on a computer, though that is far less surprising; I both have a faster output (matching my thoughts) and can do so for longer without pain (both because less motion and ones I’m more familiar with). However, there are obviously gradations to what it means to use a screen.</p>
<p>Writing these follies, for instance, feels a reasonable use of the screen. I can and often do gaze out the window at the passing scenery as the words appear on the page.<a href="#fn003" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Also, it is something mentally engaging and that brings me closer to the sort of person I wish to be. Reading on my phone or computer can likely have similar benefits, but perhaps because I cannot look away from the screen while consuming, I find it far less acceptable towards the goal.</p>
<p>In general, I want to become the sort of person that I want to become. That feels like a tautology, partially because it is, but also because I don’t entirely know what person I want to become. There are arguments in philosophy of belief about what it means to believe something, and I more and more find myself agreeing with the idea that belief and action are intrinsically linked. That is, you can, in fact, tell what someone believes by how they act. I’d like to be someone that believes time is precious<a href="#fn004" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref4"><sup>4</sup></a>, and that means I need to act like it. I want to be someone that creates, and that means creating. I want to be someone with thoughtful and well-derived opinions; that means I need to read broadly and deeply.</p>
<p>While I cannot choose to believe immediately, I can take the paths which branch towards a better version of me. Rather than blindly walking a rut in life, I can choose to look up, seeing the rushing river<a href="#fn005" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref5"><sup>5</sup></a> that marks many other winding paths. Mindful life is a goal, not a destination. Each day, I can try to believe in mindful life more.</p>
<p>Post Script<br />
It occurs to me that I also don’t want this to fall into the trap of the capitalist “every moment must be optimized”. Treating time as precious means living actively, not always filling the day. Sitting and looking at the way the stones break the tide is just as precious a use of time as generating something for others to consume. I need to remind myself of this often, especially in context of what it means to have spent time well.</p>
<p>Time being something one can spend, after all, fundamentally puts time as a form of capital.</p>
<h1 id="draft-3.1-16-september-2025">Draft 3.1: 16 September 2025</h1>
<h2 id="meta-commentary">Meta-commentary</h2>
<p>It occurs to me that the initial goal of drafts was to see the way that a thought developed. Right now, I am treating each draft more like a small essay of its own. In the past, I would title those with fractions of draft numbers. Of course, most of the time I would do so in fragmentary ways, rather than these (relatively) complete drafts. Still, I think that there are often ideas expressed within different drafts that all belong in the “final” version of a post. With that in mind, let’s try generating a full draft of what we have</p>
<h2 id="real-text">Real Text</h2>
<p>For this partial draft, I think that I want to mostly free write about what I think is important in each draft, starting at the beginning.<a href="#fn006" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Draft 1:</p>
<p>I mention the fact that this folly is inspired by a friend’s quest towards mindfulness and better texting. I want to live better, including an idea I don’t develop about how I can read for longer on phone than on paper. I know (novel) that I can also write for far longer on computer than by hand, though that may be equally speed of typing as ease of writing; my hands do not cramp when I type.</p>
<p>I point out that I am generally happiest when I drove myself like a task master. I reflected on the fact that productive is not the word I want, though it is at least close to the idea I want.</p>
<p>I reflect on the mindful nature of trains, where scenery is momentary.</p>
<p>Finally, I talk about the changes I wanted to make towards myself today.</p>
<p>Or, really finally, I end with the note from my brother, who is exploring meditation.</p>
<p>Draft 2:</p>
<p>I comment on how passive I am experiencing life, and again run into the fact that my words paint a picture of me as capital. Overstimulation becoming stimulation, and the way that double media consumption means that the odds of both ending together are minimal. Found a typo, but discussed a way to maybe be better at playing the game by stopping when it stops being fun. (new) it did work.</p>
<p>I reflected on being scared of boredom, but I don’t actually think that’s resonant with me. I think that I’m just bored of being bored. Might be worthwhile to try just turning everything off for an hour and staring out the window? (novel)</p>
<p>I went through to see how much media I wanted to consume. Perhaps because I did so, I then consumed the media more quickly.</p>
<p>Finally, Draft 3:</p>
<p>I reflect on the difference between intentionality and mindfulness, especially in relation to trains, which cannot move as freely as other forms of transport. I also point out that trains are slower and more divorced from the broader world.<a href="#fn007" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>I point out the comfort, and the way that I am becoming more connected with physical, rather than digital, time.</p>
<p>Finally, I end with the note that I am generally mentally engaged. These past weeks are probably better seen as recovery from the effort of my dissertation, rather than my new norm, when it comes to how I learn and grow.</p>
<p>Now to try sitting mindfully for an hour looking out the window, and then to write Draft 4.</p>
<p>Welp. Made it 36 minutes, but then the train came to a stop. Hard to stop thinking and not sleep.</p>
<h1 id="draft-3-16-september-2025">Draft 3: 16 September 2025</h1>
<p>This next draft<a href="#fn008" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref8"><sup>8</sup></a> may belong better in my folly <a href="trains.html">On Trains</a>, but it will lie here instead.</p>
<p>I am not entirely sure where the line between intentionality and mindfulness lies. Certainly they describe two different modes of operating in the universe, as they are two different words.<a href="#fn009" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref9"><sup>9</sup></a> I wonder if it may be a causal relationship. By living with intention, life becomes mindful. Or is it that when approaching life with mindfulness, intentionality comes out.</p>
<p>I suppose in setting the causal relationship, I can start to tease a difference out. Intentionality requires action, while mindfulness does not. I can intentionally sit and do nothing, but the absence of doing becomes the action. Mindfully sitting, however, may result in doing nothing.</p>
<p>It is perhaps unsurprising that I find myself playing with the border between these two terms. Trains are, in many regards, the most intentional of forms of transit. They can only move along perfectly prescribed paths, and only those trains which are constructed with rails at the exact same distance are able to ride. Contrast this with cars and motorcycles, which though nominally bound, can still at least in theory break from the street. Abstracted further, boats follow what they call sea lanes, but they are not fixed nor mandated. At the final level, planes fly in three dimensional space. Even though constrained to go in set patterns, there is nothing in the form itself which requires the movement.</p>
<p>And yet, despite the fact that planes are theoretically freer than cars, modern travel makes cars the freest option. I suppose that if I were able to fly my own plane I might feel differently, but. If I were to do this trip via plane, there would have been a similar number of locations that I could go to, with similarly constrained scheduling. Of course, planes are faster than trains, so what is a daily or sub-daily arrival can happen hourly.</p>
<p>If I were to have driven this, there would have been functionally no constraints on the way I traveled. Far from being intentional about when I reach and leave each location, I would be able to even choose where I travel on a whim.</p>
<p>It is perhaps this freedom in cars that makes driving feel so much less intentional to me. Even though there is almost always a best route, rare are the roads which do not at least allow for a diversion every few hours.</p>
<p>It is perhaps the speed which keeps me from feeling intentional on a plane.</p>
<p>On a train, however, the touch of the maker is everywhere. I pass by the same route that has been tread countless times by countless others. Unlike in a car, I know that my train follows the identical route; there is nowhere else its rails can take it. And, the train seems almost designed for intentional travel. In today’s fast-paced world of planes, the train travels no faster than a car. In a world where even planes are beginning to get high-speed WiFi, all of the trains I have driven on either removed their WiFi or never had it to begin with. Hours at a time see me unable to reach cellular service.</p>
<p>Unlike in a car, however, this inability to connect to the outside world does not leave me feeling a sense of fear. I am not in control of the motion, and the system is designed to make it hard or impossible to collide with another train.</p>
<p>Too, the train has a viewing deck. Even outside of this area with chairs facing towards the windows, the seating area has windows larger than in my home. My view of nature is just obstructed enough to remind me that I am enlosed in a climate protected shell. The scenery passes me by, and because trains were laid with linear intention, we pass through the mountains, rather than looping around them as cars are oft to. Because trains do not turn well, the track does not whip me about.</p>
<p>And so, even though I find myself fighting to break the habits which call for me to live mindlessly, the mere act of riding a train pushes me towards a mindful state. While I can wander up and down the aisles, there are still only four cars. I can stream non-local media when there is service, but it is so variable as to be difficult. I can waste my time away<a href="#fn0010" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref10"><sup>10</sup></a> by playing games, and yet even still the not-infrequent bumps mean that I am never able to completely escape the reality of motion, unlike on a plane or while stationary. The passage of time flows by me, and though I am untethered from hours and minutes, I am much more tied to the time of day. I watched the sunrise from dawn through nearly noon. I watched the sunfire sky fade into night.</p>
<p>Of course, this may equally be that I am simply finally recovering from the burnout of writing my thesis. I often found<a href="#fn0011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref11"><sup>11</sup></a> that I would only make it a few days or a week into any given break before I would be done with rest and once again yearn for motion and action. Or, at the very least, I become able to sit with myself again. I want to play the games right now, but I think this is a legitimate want, rather than simply a question of filling my hours. I’m going to try asking myself after each round whether I actually enjoy the gameplay loop still. If the answer is no, then I will set the game down and find another activity.</p>
<h1 id="draft-2-16-september-2025">Draft 2: 16 September 2025</h1>
<p>One of my dearest friends recently posted a consideration<a href="#fn0012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref12"><sup>12</sup></a> on the theme of mindfulness. It made me think about the fact that, despite my own goals to experience this month more mindfully, I have really been fairly passively spending my time.<a href="#fn0013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref13"><sup>13</sup></a> I am on the way back to the middle from the western portion of the trip, which makes this as good a time as any other, if not a better one, to think about how to better use my time.<a href="#fn0014" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>So, why do I passively take in time?</p>
<p>I do enjoy playing the games that I play, at least at first. However, much like the joke of “oh no, there’s milk left over after I finished my cookies... oh no there are cookies left over after I finished my milk”, I never seem to end the games in sync with whatever media I’m consuming. There’s a form of the hedonic treadmill: neither listening to the podcast nor playing the game feels stimulating enough on their own, and so I tie them together. Perhaps in the same way that I consume media<a href="#fn0015" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref15"><sup>15</sup></a>, I feel that it’s less unproductive to consume more media in the same time period. Of course, there’s nothing about this phase of my life that requires production.</p>
<p>I suppose one answer to the wasting time is to reflect after each game whether or not I’m still actively having fun. If not, I can stop the game. I do know that decision fatigue is a real thing, however. Then again, I’m kept in this train for the rest of the day. Assuming that decision fatigue is reset at sleep, there’s minimal that I can choose other than being mindless.<a href="#fn0016" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Why else do I passively pass through the stream of time?<a href="#fn0017" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>Boredom is scary. It don’t think that I’m yet in a great mental place in regards to the death of my mother and the death of the part of me that is a student. When I stop to let my mind go where it will, I worry that I’ll get stuck somewhere darker than I can escape. Writing it out, though, I hate that option. Fear will not define me unless I let it, and I refuse to let it right now.</p>
<p>Other than fear of boredom, ease of getting trapped in loops, and a vague feeling of wanting to consume, is there anything else that drives me not to be mindful?</p>
<p>Lack of inspiration maybe; there’s nothing I have with me that I particularly want to give my time to. I suppose that I have yet to do the philosophy books, and those would likely work really well. I enjoy book binding, at least in theory<a href="#fn0018" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref18"><sup>18</sup></a>, and I said that I wanted to learn philosophy. That’s still true enough, and so maybe when I finish here, I’ll once again work on reading the web novel, and then bind the book. For now, I’m comfortable goign through the media that I have until I’ve caught up<a href="#fn0019" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref19"><sup>19</sup></a> on all the things I said I would do. Then again, 160 items is a lot. I’m curious how much time they’ll take.</p>
<p>At single speed: 86 hours, 15 minutes if I include the audio drama, 56 hours, 45 minutes if not. At 3x speed, that means about 28 hours 45 minutes or 19 hours. By the end of the trip I’ll have absoluitley gone though the first of those, and likely the second as well. However, it’s enough that I don’t think that I need to pace myself lest I run out of content.<a href="#fn0020" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>For now, let’s see what book binding feels like while listening to some of the videos. I’ll come back and reflect on that then. maybe then also read some of the books I’m binding. Current time as of sitting down to bind intro to phenomen and musicking: 758. 16 folios for musicking later: 806. One hour later, the other book is folded, and musicking is finished. Listened to about 1.3 hours of 3x speed, which feels about right?</p>
<p>Now to go read!<a href="#fn0021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<h1 id="draft-1-15-september-2025">Draft 1: 15 September 2025</h1>
<p>One of my friends is considering ways to live more mindfully and to also be better at texting. Despite the fact that these two goals feel almost intrinsically opposed, I cannot say that I don’t understand. I think that I would benefit from being worse at texting, but both of us share the sentiment that we would be better served by using phones less. So, why do I want to live mindfully?</p>
<p>At a gut level, I think that it’s probably generally better to live life experientially than passively. When I’m on the phone or media-maxing<a href="#fn0022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref22"><sup>22</sup></a>, I don’t have time to sit with myself. Even when just on the train, I find myself getting bored after just a few minutes. For some reason, I can read for far longer on my phone than on my computer.</p>
<p>I’m not entirely sure what the solution is. On the one hand, most of the platforms I use to contact people also have space for me to mindlessly scroll. I also enjoy being up to date on the trends of my generation. On the other, I do really love the concept of living authentically. I’ve talked a lot with some people about how I may live too much for the future. That is, I rarely look back at myself and wish that I had been gentler on myself.<a href="#fn0023" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Rather, I find that I am most happy with my life when I was pushing myself.</p>
<p>I’m just over a week into my journey across the country. I’m just over two weeks into my journey as a Doctor.</p>
<p>In that time, I have been far less productive than I have desired. Productive is not exactly the word I’m looking for, however. Much as I would have liked to do more posts or get back into my web novel, I also wanted to be on my devices less and be more present. I wanted to bind the books I’ve packed and read them.</p>
<p>Maybe the word I’m looking for is actually mindful. I have not been as mindful of my time and place as I’ve wanted.</p>
<p>Something about riding on the train is fundamentally geared towards mindfulness. The scenery is constantly passing by, and so each sight out the window is different from every view before and after. I’ve seen countless stunning vistas that passed away before I was able to get my phone out to photograph them.<a href="#fn0024" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Whenever I look up from a screen or book or nap, I find my breath almost taken away by the beauty of the land.<a href="#fn0025" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>So, as I get ready to end my day<a href="#fn0026" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref26"><sup>26</sup></a>, I think on the ways that I can be better going forward. There’s a philosophy channel I follow who talks a fair amount about belief. Apparently, there exists a fairly large strain in the philosophy of belief that claims belief is fundamentally tied to action; if I do not act a way, I do not truly believe. From that, being better to me means equally setting better beliefs and acting in accordance with those stated beliefs. Looking at my daily reflection, I think that there is something to be said for the goals I set. I will try to go stretch and pray now, and then I’ll lie down and see how I feel in a few minutes. Maybe I’ll be up again for some composition, maybe I’ll want to read my web novel. Maybe I’ll want to use my screen and need to remind myself that while the base parts of me want to spend all day staring at media, the rest of me does not. As my brother said, “it’s about making the media in your mind.”</p>

<li><p>Did you journal by hand today?</p>
<p>I did! After a lovely breakfast with an old Virginian.<a href="#fn0027" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Did you do a folly?</p>
<p>Yesterday! I also wrote a draft of today’s yesterday, which is kind of fun.</p></li>
<li><p>Did you in some way, shape, or form advance the web novel?</p>
<p>Yesterday after posting the folly I read nine chapters. This morning I have read 11 chapters. That means that I just have like 250 to go.</p></li>
<li><p>Did you work on music, whether education or creation?</p>
<p>No. I listened to an audio book, so not even music in that sense. I guess that I did talk a fair amount about music in some chapters of the web novel!</p></li>
<li><p>Did you work on book binding?</p>
<p>The novel is now fully bound! Other than that, though, no. Yet another activity I can do.</p></li>
<li><p>Did you work on another hobby?</p>
<p>I played video games, and listened to podcasts and audiobooks. I think that counts.</p></li>
<li><p>Did you stretch? Really?</p>
<p>Yes! Before bed I stretched and then this morning after breakfast I stretched again.</p></li>
<li><p>Prayer?</p>
<p>A little bit. Still hard for me to know what to pray.</p></li>
<li><p>Meditation?</p>
<p>Yeah! Or at the very least, sitting without explicit stimulus and trying to have a quiet mind.</p></li>
<li><p>Reading?</p>
<p>Eh.</p></li>

<h1 id="on-kindness"><a href="kindness.html">On Kindness</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2025 September 15</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-15-september-2025">Draft 1: 15 September 2025</h1>
<p>Today in the Uber from my brother’s apartment to the train station, the driver asked why I was in town.<a href="#fn011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> When I said that I was visiting my brother, he replied “Oh, that’s so kind of you.” That made me think about the word kind.</p>
<p>It was clear pretty quickly that English was not his only mother tongue.<a href="#fn012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> It’s totally possible that kind is just the word he has for general sense of positive action. However, I then started thinking about one of the conversations I had with my mother and family. She expressed that she did not think of herself as nice, and the rest of my family disagreed. I generally agreed with her, since and kind are different<a href="#fn013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In reading Brene<a href="#fn014" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Brown’s “Atlas of the Heart”, I was glad to see that she had the same opinion. While I did not agree with all of her emotional definitions<a href="#fn015" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref5"><sup>5</sup></a>, I did greatly agree with her distinction between kind and nice. Kindness is helping others, not just by doing what you think that they need, but doing what they actually need.<a href="#fn016" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Niceness, by contrast, is not rocking the boat.</p>
<p>My mother was a small first-generation college-educated woman. It is perhaps unsurprising, then, that she learned not to be nice very early on in her career. If she was unwilling to rock the boat or be a nuisance, then there was no way that she would accomplish any of her professional goals. She was more than willing to tell people when they were wrong, and was more than happy to stand up and disagree with others.</p>
<p>However, she tempered this general lack of niceness with the greatest amount of kindness I think I have ever seen in someone. My entire life, old farmers would come up to us when we were in public to ask my mother for medical help. She always made time for them. One day I asked her why, and she explained that for many of them, not only is the act of going to the doctor something incredibly time consuming, but it is also an uncomfortable environment.<a href="#fn017" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref7"><sup>7</sup></a> By helping them with their questions when they came up, however, she was able to monitor them and make sure that they were doing ok.</p>
<p>Whenever someone collapsed in church,<a href="#fn018" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref8"><sup>8</sup></a> she was the first to respond. At one of my football games, a player hurt his neck, and she leapt over the fence and onto the field almost before anyone else noticed.</p>
<p>So, then, other than gushing about how great my mother was, what’s the point of these past paragraphs?</p>
<p>Honestly, not totally sure!</p>
<p>I’ve written a fair bit lately about the meaning of words, and so spending some time distinguishing kindness and niceness feels reasonable enough. I think that this can honestly be a reasonable enough short musing. Maybe it’s just that I want to make sure that this post gets posted, and I know that I won’t if I keep waiting. Still, I’m starting a sixty<a href="#fn019" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref9"><sup>9</sup></a> hour train ride, which means now might very well be a great time to start binding books again!</p>

<h1 id="on-creating-for-myself"><a href="creating-for-myself.html">On Creating for Myself</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2025 September 15 (I’m so bad at hitting post)</p>
<h1 id="draft-3-12-september-2025">Draft 3: 12 September 2025</h1>
<p>As I was packing for my train trip, I found myself also wanting to pick up reading again. In addition to the books of music theory and epistemology I printed, I also brought a few print books that I’ve wanted to read. So far as I can remember, the books came from my mother, who gave me most of her theology collection a year or so before she died. It hurts to realize that I was the only one of her children who was holding to the faith then, even more because I no longer hold as closely. However, even though all that I do is fundamentally colored by both the way she raised me and her current absence, that is not what the point of that anecdote was. Rather, it was to explain how best I think that I came into a copy of “The Nonviolent Alternative” by Thomas Merton.</p>
<p>At first, I had thought that it was a full tome with one coherent through line. Instead, it is apparently a posthumously collected series of letters, reflections, essays, and the like by Merton. It opens with a fairly lengthy essay by the collector, which puts Merton’s work in the broader context. Given that this book came out just a year or so after Merton died, though, there was not much room to see the long term ripples. I don’t normally spend two full paragraphs on background, but for some reason, I feel the importance of noting what brought the essay I read to me. The first Merton writing in the book is “Original Child Bomb”, subtitled “Points for meditation to be scratched on the walls of a cave”.</p>
<p>In 41 verses, Merton tells the story of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. Unlike every other framing of the story I have seen, the science plays almost no role. The scientists exist solely as phantom figures who occasionally oppose the bombing of a civilian populace.</p>
<p>In 41 verses, Merton shows the way that the modern war apparatus fundamentally precludes a just war.</p>
<p>My first two drafts today focused on the reasons I create. Reading the biography of Merton at the front of the book, I was reminded of the real reason I should do everything: I am called to do so by my faith.</p>
<p>The struggles that I have with the Catholic Church, especially as it exists in America, are not unique to my current age. Indeed, Zahn noted back in 1971 or 1980<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> that “scandals abound, not least of which involve bishops who have never found it within themselves to express pubic concern over the napalming of innocent civilians but who are quick to publish fervent denunciations of the napalming of Selective Service records.” Merton saw this same secular theology that the bishops of that age had. Where I find this fact hard to face and find myself struggling with my face because of it, Merton remained a faithful and obedient monk.</p>
<p>It seems as though “Original Child Bomb” was just many of the writings that Merton put out over the years. From the implications I have seen, it was not a particularly long project for him. I wonder if it required drafting, or if by that point in his life Merton was just so filled with the Spirit and had such a well-formed voice that the lines came out at once. I had meant to read the entire book in a sitting, but I found that I could not keep reading after the first.</p>
<p>The hobbies I want to do I want to do because I think that I can make the world better.</p>
<p>If Merton failed to do so, despite being so clearly a man of faith and being someone in conversation with leaders, what hope do I have?</p>
<p>On the other hand, despair is the easiest option. I may not have his reach or his fluidity with prose, but I have my own unique view on things. Merton’s view on Just War Theology seems as though it was relatively unique, and so far as I can tell, it remains relatively unique. He wrote “Original Child Bomb” near the eve of his earthly life, I am<a href="#fn022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> near the beginning or early middle of mine.</p>
<p>So, what does creation do for me? Creation gives me a way to scream at a world gone mad, hoping to restore some sense of semblance. In prose which hopefully lacks polemics, I aspire to my writing bringing others closer to truth, love, and beauty. In making art, I hope to create beauty, which by its nature orients humanity towards the beautiful and true. In creating anything at all, I reveal my spark of Divinity, which will hopefully light myself and the world aflame.</p>
<p>Wow that was fun. I could do some drafting about what I want to do, but that doesn’t feel quite as meaningful or necessary right now. I’m happy with the way that these three drafts have helped me to come to an idea of not just what I want to do, but also why. I don’t know if my web novel currently does anything to be beautiful or lead others to truth and love. Rather than stop it, however, I guess that it would be better if I was to focus on that.</p>
<p>So, then, I suppose that what I have taken from today’s folly is that I don’t create for myself, nor do I really want to. Instead, I want to create so that I can bring the world to a better place. The only way that I can improve my ability to create something beautiful is to practice. And thus, my practice will continue.</p>
<h1 id="draft-2-12-september-2025">Draft 2: 12 September 2025</h1>
<p>Why do I create?</p>
<p>I’m not totally sure, if I’m being totally honest.</p>
<p>There exist the obvious answers: the spark of the Divine within me kindling the world around, because I like all people fear my mortality and respond by trying to leave a legacy, my belief that I am better able to do things than others, the impacts I have sen that I can make. There are probably less obvious answers which would come to me if I thought more or deeper about the question. What I am nearly positive of, though, is that I do not create for myself.</p>
<p>Even though I do want to grow as a person and in my skills, I don’t think of what I do as being for myself. Although that’s a fun contradiction for me to explore, I don’t think that’s what I want to use this draft for. Rather, I want to explore the different forms of creation that I’ve either lost, fallen away from, or simply want to begin ab initio.<a href="#fn023" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>This site is the obvious place for me to begin. If I was writing this for myself, I don’t know what that would mean. Would I SEO the site to make money on the side? Should I be posting my most extreme views, so that everyone around me can learn about the most radical takes I have? Should I be curating a clean image of myself, such that no employer, regardless of how dedicated, could find something negative about me? Should I be making it something that helps me to think about the world?</p>
<p>Let’s answer those one by one.</p>
<p>SEO is a special kind of hell. As I’ve listened to some videos<a href="#fn024" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref4"><sup>4</sup></a> about the platform culture, I more and more believe and see that there is something fundamentally broken about the idea of platform as service. That’s something I can explore later, but for now simply knowing that I hate that concept is probably sufficient.</p>
<p>Much as I enjoy testing the limits of my freedom of speech, I don’t know that this is a good idea. At the very least, I have seen the way that writing angry and inflamed<a href="#fn025" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref5"><sup>5</sup></a> posts has made others in my life less happy and more angry. That’s not really a goal of mine. Also, I quite enjoy life on this side of prison walls. Given the current political climate, I do start to worry about the things that I say coming back to cause me demonstrable harm.</p>
<p>At the other extreme, though, I do not want to push myself into a mold. I don’t want to stay within the lines solely to avoid being beaten down by someone else.</p>
<p>Alas, the remaining paragraphs have been lost somehow. In general, I think that I said that I want to write for a variety of reasons, and that’s ok. However, since then I’ve read a bit of Thomas Merton, which has been really life changing, and so now we go on to draft again.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-12-september-2025">Draft 1: 12 September 2025</h1>
<p>I just read a beautiful piece of prose on writing from a dear friend of mine. In reading it and doing my own daily reflection, both digitally and on paper,<a href="#fn026" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref6"><sup>6</sup></a> I found myself thinking about how hard it is to start any hobby, maybe especially one that I’ve dropped before. I spent a fair bit of time<a href="#fn027" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref7"><sup>7</sup></a> considering what I wanted to title the post, and I ended up deciding that a post about trying to shift the reason I write would be a good one. After all, much of the advice I see about creation says that we should not work for the adoration of crowds, but rather create for the sake of our own muse.</p>
<p>I then thought about how modern and Western that thought was.</p>
<p>I do not exist alone, and so it is ridiculous that I should create for myself alone. Even though I’ve met almost none of the readers of my web novel in person<a href="#fn028" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref8"><sup>8</sup></a>, I still should think of them as complete and beautiful humans. Life lived in service of the other is the most fulfilling, so many theologies say.</p>
<p>So then, what does it mean for me to create something for myself? Is that something that I should even try for?</p>
<p>I think that generally when people say that we should create art for ourselves, it comes from a place of saying that we should not focus our muse on some hypothetical audience. Instead, we should create the art that we are called to. However, the fact that what I consider art at all, let alone what art I craft by nature is culturally constructed rarely enters the equation. Neither does the fact that, especially if I have an audience, there is an argument that I have some kind of duty to them. I of all people am always a fan of the idea that we owe so very much to each other and that we have a duty to fulfill.</p>
<p>So where does that lead me?</p>
<p>By confirmed viewership, my web novel is by and away the most engaged with art that I create. By positive impact to the intellectual<a href="#fn029" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref9"><sup>9</sup></a> world, the science communication videos I’m planning will likely be the greatest.<a href="#fn0210" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref10"><sup>10</sup></a> By self introspection, this site seems the best. By positive impact to the world, knitting and donating hats is probably the best I can do.</p>
<p>There exists in economics the idea of relative advantage. That is, even if organization A is better at production of everything than organization B, they may be more better at one than another. In that case, economics says that A should produce the thing that they’re most able to outperform in and then purchase the rest. There are clear benefits to this approach, especially when taken at small scales.</p>
<p>If I have a neighbor who is great at sewing and I am great at farming, then the two of us can both have nicer clothes and food by sharing. Atomizing the roles we have ends up reducing the atomization of people, because I am then reliant on his sewing, and he is reliant on my farming.</p>
<p>When this same approach is taken to the global stage, however, there are any number of issues.</p>
<p>I don’t like that I live in capitalism, or whatever the current system which holds me is. Rebellion takes a number of forms, and art is almost always among them. I do not think that I can generate art for the state, regardless of what the state is. So, then, does writing this site for myself end up doing good by virtue of speaking truth to power?</p>
<p>Am I speaking truth to power? I doubt that anyone with political strength reads this.</p>
<p>Am I screaming into the void?</p>
<p>If I scream into the void long enough, will he scream back?</p>
<p>I don’t know the answer, and I don’t know that this current draft is taking me anywhere good. I had also wanted to muse on the idea of what hobbies I want to get back into and why, and these words have probably been helpful in framing my mind. As I’ve been writing these past few follies, I do find myself realizing that there’s a lot that I gain by simply word vomiting free association on the page. Second drafts find themselves hitting places I don’t know that I would have otherwise found. Since the goal of this site is to help me explore myself, thought and idea, that’s the best that it can do.</p>

<h1 id="on-trains"><a href="trains.html">On Trains</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2025 September 12 (no service on trains and then forgotten)</p>
<p>N.B. Draft 2 is rambly, sad, and generally disorganized. That is to say, Draft 2 is like me right now.</p>
<h1 id="draft-2-8-september-2025">Draft 2: 8 September 2025</h1>
<p>When I was in high school, I talked with my best friend about doing a road trip across all of Interstate 80. We didn’t end up doing it before undergrad, because we were too busy. In the summer before my graduate school, then, I really planned on doing it. That summer was 2020, however, and suddenly the idea of going cross country by car became both more and less feasible. I am now done with graduate school, and by most objective standards have reached the pinnacle of schooling; this is my last chance for a post graduation travel celebration. Even though I haven’t been writing as much here as I would’ve liked this summer<a href="#fn031" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, I do feel like the fact that I traveled a lot is still clear. From June 1st to yesterday, I put more than 6000 miles on my car.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure 6000 miles gets me most of the way across the US. Even if it was mostly in a spiderweb shape, rather than a line, then, it’s as though I did what I had set out to do. So, trains felt like the best way to visit friends, because I had the hope that they’d be less of a nightmare than flying. In what is no surprise at all, they are.</p>
<p>I’m hoping that these weeks of travel can be for me a kind of resetting. I will be entering corporate America starting in October, and while I am very excited for the fact, I am also somewhat nervous. I don’t know what that life will be like, and I feel like I’m kind of wasting my degree. However, I am also almost entirely burned out of thinking, especially about chemistry. This month will, if nothing else, be a period of time with no obligations on my mind.</p>
<p>I’m finding myself more and more emotional as I think about the trip. I think that part of me is still feeling cheated by the fact that my mom was unable to watch me graduate. Another part of me is just generaly worried about not having a place I can retreat to for the rest of the month; normally when I feel like life is too much I can either go to my apartment, or if things are particularly bad, back home. I suppose that since I’m only doing my bookings a week or so in advance, I can always cancel, but that feels like the worst answer.</p>
<p>Anyways, trains are great because they’re way more spacious and travel feels much more real than on a plane. When I see cars pass by slowly or be passed by slowly, I am connected to the sense of getting between points in a way that airplanes cannot do. Unlike driving, I can stand up and stretch, take a nap, or just close my eyes for a bit without negative consequences.</p>
<p>The train is just now hitting the part of Montana responsible for having mountains on the horizon.<a href="#fn032" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> This is not my first time seeing the Rockies, or even my first time traveling through them. I do think that this might be my first time going through the Rockies<a href="#fn033" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref3"><sup>3</sup></a> since what feels like my family’s last great road trip. I must have been ten or so, and we decided to drive to the West Coast to see my mom’s family. I remember watching math lectures on DVD with my brothers, far too much Homestar Runner, and listetning and singing along to so much great music. I remember going to see family, and I remember the lawyers in my family telling me that I should become a lawyer. I think that I remember going to a National Park or four.</p>
<p>I don’t remember my mom’s voice as we drove. I don’t remember what I wore. I don’t remember the feeling of love as she wrapped me in a hug, back when she was still taller than me.</p>
<p>Life is a train, I’m sure I’ve heard said before. While being on these first hours of train time, I’ve been thinking about the 1970’s song “City of New Orleans”, which is about a train. It’s also about America, the death of small towns, and the loss of innocence.<a href="#fn034" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The train stopped for a half hour or so in some middle of nowhere town in rural Montana; we were ahead of schedule. With the town less than an hour behind me, I have already forgotten its name. I remember that there was an Ace, and that they were fundraising for some children’s event.</p>
<p>If life is a train, what are the stops?</p>
<p>Last night I slept through all of the state of Minnesota. Or, at least, I have no memories I can pin to the state. It is more than possible that I was at some point awake, whether complaining to myself about a neighbor<a href="#fn035" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref5"><sup>5</sup></a> or just bemoaning my inability to sleep through the night. How much of my own life have I slept through? What vast swaths of temporal land have I just let pass me by completely unnoted?</p>
<p>If life is a train, I would have said that my mom was the conductor. I don’t mean this in a domineering way, she was just the person I went to for all my questions and life concerns. Without her, I find that I don’t know who to turn to when I have questions.</p>
<p>If life is a train, what place does fath have?</p>
<p>That feels forced, but I’m thinking about how trains are so far from a faith object. There’s a comment on my web novel I think about a lot, which caused me to learn that concrete the noun is much younger than the adjective. That is, someone looked at concrete and went “yeah that seems pretty definite”. Similarly, trains are behemoths of steel and oil. They travel with no freedom, bound by the tracks that countless men laid. I have been thinking about my own relationship to faith a lot lately. Am I like the train, living a life not just needless of faith, but in active oposition to it?</p>
<p>If life is a train, what am I?</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-8-september-2025">Draft 1: 8 September 2025</h1>
<p>I’m officially just over a day into my post graduation<a href="#fn036" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref6"><sup>6</sup></a> celebratory trip. I decided to celebrate by going on a long train trip.</p>
<p>Mostly, that decision came because I’ve been feeling really burned out of driving lately.<a href="#fn037" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref7"><sup>7</sup></a> I want to visit many of the friends that have asked me to visit them through the ages, and I wanted to not deal with flights, because I hate planes in many regards. I had a memory of one of the guys I dove with while studying abroad<a href="#fn038" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref8"><sup>8</sup></a> talking about how good the train system in the US is for getting around the country. Since I didn’t want to drive, didn’t really want to fly, the old classic trio left me with a single other option.</p>
<p>And so, yesterday I drove down to the singular city which Amtrak uses to connect the east and west<a href="#fn039" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref9"><sup>9</sup></a>, saw a friend<a href="#fn0310" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref10"><sup>10</sup></a>, and boarded a train to follow the advice once given to the founder of my home town “go west”. My initial thoughts upon getting onto the train were that trains are just miles away better than planes. Each seat is more than large enough for me to comfortably sit, there’s no judgement for wandering, and there was literally no security. I brought what I’m pretty sure is more bags than I was supposed to. I’m the only one in my row of two seats, which is also really nice. I love that the seat assignments are hand-done still.</p>
<p>Anyways, perhaps because of the nature of the novelty of train tripping, perhaps because of the absence of WiFi, and perhaps because semidaily<a href="#fn0311" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref11"><sup>11</sup></a> musing is my jam, I did not write a folly. With that in mind, given that it’s currently not yet 11 am central and that I am in the mountain time soon, I figured now would be a good time to blog aobut trains. Except, having written these three and a bit paragraphs, I realize that I don’t really have that much else to say about trains. I guess it’s time to go ahead and flip the coin between finishing binding the book and reading a paper book. I think that I’ll start with binding the web novel because I am enjoying a podcast<a href="#fn0312" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref12"><sup>12</sup></a> and want to finish it. We’lll see what I feel like doing by the time that the podcast is over. Likely either sit and silently do the binding, another podcast, or read “the Nonviolent Alternative”, which I think was in my mother’s theology collection before she gave it to me. I’ll be back for draft two!</p>
<h1 id="daily-reflection-8-september-2025">Daily Reflection 8 September 2025</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Did you journal by hand today?</p>
<p>I did! I also did yesterday, even if I didn’t write my folly then.</p></li>
<li><p>Did you do a folly?</p>
<p>Not yesterday, sadly enough. I’m about to do one now though.</p></li>
<li><p>Did you in some way, shape, or form advance the web novel?</p>
<p>No. That’s a little bit sad, but it’s also only Monday. I’m sure that in the next few days I’ll have the time and mental space to do so.</p></li>
<li><p>Did you work on music, whether education or creation?</p>
<p>I was getting ready to bind my undergraduate composition professor’s favorite text<a href="#fn0313" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref13"><sup>13</sup></a> when I realized that I had packed a book on program music instead. That was sad.</p></li>
<li><p>Did you work on book binding?</p>
<p>See above.</p></li>
<li><p>Did you work on another hobby?</p>
<p>Video games, otherwise not really.</p></li>
<li><p>Did you stretch? Really?</p>
<p>I did! Last night at like 9pm I did a quick 5 minute stretch in the back of the train car. Might do more after this.</p></li>
<li><p>Prayer?</p>
<p>I packed a rosary, at least.</p></li>
<li><p>Meditation?</p>
<p>Kind of. I historically<a href="#fn0314" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref14"><sup>14</sup></a> have daydreamed my way to sleep, but last night in particular I went for the whole “I may or may not be able to sleep like this, so at the very least we can do the Mythbusters approved meditate which gets me most of the benefits.” Wow meditation is boring.</p></li>
<li><p>Reading?</p>
<p>I read Chaotic Craftsman so much yesterday. However, it is an incredibly long book, and so I only made it through I think about 200 chapters.<a href="#fn0315" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref15"><sup>15</sup></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Minimizing screen time?</p>
<p>Not even at all in the slightest. A part of me is unsure how much I really want to, but I guess that’s a question for another time. I suppose that I do really want to read the books that I packed, so I might start on that. Assuming I can finish one of them within the next 15 hours, I might be able to give it away, and therefore both reduce the size and weight (reduce both?) of my luggage, and also give a gift to my hosts.</p></li>

<h1 id="on-words-for-rare-knowledge"><a href="words-rare-knowledge.html">On Words for Rare Knowledge</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2025 September 6</p>
<h1 id="draft-2-6-september-2025">Draft 2: 6 September 2025</h1>
<p>Now that I’m officially a doctor, I get to live the dream that I’ve had on some level motivating me since I was a child: the power to define and redefine words as I see fit.<a href="#fn041" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> I’ve also been thinking a lot about knowledge, and since I was unable to get a chapter on theory of knowledge and science in particular in my thesis<a href="#fn042" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, this next period of the page might be filled with my attempts to come to one.<a href="#fn043" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref3"><sup>3</sup></a> I’d like to find some like fundamental set of reading for theory of knowledge, and it just as writing that occurred to me I can do that. Turns out “epistemology” is the study of theory of knowledge, which is definitely something I once knew. Although I am a firm believer that reading primary sources is often useful, as a chemist I am also a firm believer that often there’s synthetic information<a href="#fn044" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref4"><sup>4</sup></a> that is not easily or often transmitted in the original sources. With that in mind, I’ve found a few texts that might help me with my epistemology, which is great!<a href="#fn045" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Where was I?</p>
<p>Oh right.</p>
<p>As a doctor and a person interested in knowledge, I want to be precise in my language usage, especially here.<a href="#fn046" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The world, at least as I’ve known it, loves the idea of secret and hidden knowledge. Or, being fully clear, it loves the idea of rare knowledge.</p>
<p>What does it mean for knowledge to be rare?</p>
<p>It can mean any number of things to any number of people. From last draft<a href="#fn047" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref7"><sup>7</sup></a>, we have that this knowledge can be hidden,<a href="#fn048" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref8"><sup>8</sup></a> require the learner<a href="#fn049" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref9"><sup>9</sup></a> to change their view on reality<a href="#fn0410" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref10"><sup>10</sup></a>,<a href="#fn0411" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref11"><sup>11</sup></a>, be understood at some intuitive and uncommon level,<a href="#fn0412" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref12"><sup>12</sup></a> or be mysterious.<a href="#fn0413" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref13"><sup>13</sup></a> In that set of distinctions, I did of course level the fact that knowledge can be hidden of its own accord (it’s not always obvious to people the outcomes of their actions) or by an agent (as is popular in conspiracy thinking), the fact that the intuitive knowledge may be ancillary or required, and the fact that mystery means many things to many people. Still, these are some good starting places. Let’s see what other words people use for rare knowledge, and see how we might use these distinctions.</p>
<p>We’ve:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>recondite: from the Latin past participle of “to conceal”. Cool, so occult knowledge is knowledge which is hidden of its own accord and recondite knowledge which is hidden by an external agent. The MW<a href="#fn0414" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref14"><sup>14</sup></a> <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/recondite">definition</a> for the word suggests....</p></li>
<li><p>condite: pickled or preserved. There’s something to be said for knowledge rare by virtue of having been preserved and therefore unquestioned. I cannot think of many times that I’ll need to care about it, but I guess we’ll keep it in the back pocket. Looking at its synonym page:</p></li>
<li><p>esoteric: for the specially initiated. I think that’s good enough on its own. Esoterica are things which require understanding some fundamental set of axioms and facts<a href="#fn0415" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref15"><sup>15</sup></a> before they can be understood. Much of physical chemistry is esoteric. Great.</p></li>
<li><p>profound: difficult for normies.<a href="#fn0416" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref16"><sup>16</sup></a> I have no interest in using profound most of the time. By virtue of being rare I feel like most knowledge has to be profound, but maybe I’m too optimistic in others. I feel like if learning something is easy, people will do it.</p></li>
<li><p>abtruse: as with profound. We’re going to skip words I don’t plan to use moving forward.</p></li>
<li><p>hermetic: related to the works of Hermes Trismegistus. Generally I’ll use this as knowledge which must be revealed from a physical agent to be learned or understood. That will stand in contrast to some word meaning revealed by a non-physical agent<a href="#fn0417" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref17"><sup>17</sup></a> and is often going to be recondite and esoteric. The truly hermetic works may very well be condite.</p></li>
<li><p>cryptic: MW says hidden or ambiguous meaning. I’m going to take ambiguous, and say that something like a Zen Koan is cryptic. That is, the goal is less the knowledge itself as the pondering which is of value.</p></li>
<li><p>mystic: MW says mysterious which makes sense when I look at the letters. I’m going to use mystic knowledge to refer to supernatural knowledge, standing in contrast to hermetic knowledge.<a href="#fn0418" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>numinous: MW says supernatural or mysterious, also filled with divinity or spiritual. I’ll use numinous rarely, I have to imagine. I guess internally I feel like mystic has an element of experiential knowledge, while numinous doesn’t. Great.</p>
<p>We’ll see if that difference bears out.</p></li>
<li><p> acintya: from looking up koans, I learn this is the Sanskrit word for unanswerable questions. I’ll use that in place of Koan?</p>
<p>Maybe not.</p>
<p>Looks like a better usage is for knowledge which obscures future knowledge. I can absolutely see the use in something like that. Since eldritch knowledge requires viewing creation<a href="#fn0419" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref19"><sup>19</sup></a> differently, it will likely obscure other facts.<a href="#fn0420" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>What about magic?</p>
<p>I think that magic might be for things which aren’t known but are actionable. That is, if I have a box that tells me the weather, that’s magic. For most people,<a href="#fn0421" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref21"><sup>21</sup></a> a computer is magic. Magic is that which is not known.</p>
<p>Do I want to somehow distinguish the weather box that is unknowable from the computer, which is theoretically knowable? Do I want to distinguish being able to understand parts but not the whole<a href="#fn0422" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref22"><sup>22</sup></a>?</p>
<p>We’ll see if it comes up. Why is this relevant? Oh, that’s probably a great thing to cover too.</p>
<p>New draft time?</p>
<p>Nah, let’s<a href="#fn0423" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref23"><sup>23</sup></a> figure out the reason why here.</p>
<p>I think that knowledge is not commonly held for a number of reasons. I was talking to friends last night, and one of them mentioned that in Psychology, there’s a growing idea that it is useful to learn about the emotional words with no direct cognates in a given language, as they can potentially help others to better understand or name their experience. Even before that, though, the idea of unknown or not-widely known knowledge being for a number of reasons is something that’s entranced me.</p>
<p>Is this related to my faith questions at all? Honestly I don’t know. Probably, since on some level it’s also my whole “what do I know and what do I believe?” thing. I’m hopefully<a href="#fn0424" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref24"><sup>24</sup></a> never going to be a pure Descartian “all I can prove is that I am having thoughts”, and generally am completely fine with the idea of knowledge, objective reality, and the transmission of both.</p>
<p>That’s probably a good thing to have printed on the top of each page of philosophy I read. There’s something to be said for “touch grass” as a general catch-all for “if you have an issue with acting in the world from learning something new, maybe you shouldn’t base your life on it”. Then I do get to the whole concept of a useful lie, which is ope another whole thing I need to consider.</p>
<p>What are things which are untrue but used to lead to greater truth?</p>
<p>Model is a word, useful lie is a term. I think that both ill serve my purpose for now. A lot of esoteric knowledge is recondite because learning the useful lies which prepare you for understanding the occult knowledge hide the deeper fact. As an example, people hate the idea of the electron cloud because we learn the ball and stick model, and then the orbital model. The fact that electrons co-exist in the same space feels even harder to understand because we have explanations for the behavior. Should I try to come up with an example of each form of hidden knowledge and explanation?</p>
<p>Probably.</p>
<p>Will I? Eh.</p>
<p>Let’s just write up the words here and call it for the day. I don’t want to burn out on writing, and this is a solid more than two thousand words.<a href="#fn0425" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<h1 id="draft-1-6-september-2025">Draft 1: 6 September 2025</h1>
<p>Something that’s bothered me for a while is the idea that we have so many words which mean the exact same thing. In general, words have slightly different flavors of meaning, which is totally fine for me. When talking about knowledge, especially knowledge which is not widely held, there does not seem to be this same distinction. Since I’ve already accepted that what I write here is going to be explicitly and intentionally<a href="#fn0426" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref26"><sup>26</sup></a> using language in a way that is not the norm. With that in mind, I want to start distinguishing the words for rare knowledge, especially because I am about to embark on a train journey where I have the intention of reading a number of philosophical works.<a href="#fn0427" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>So, then, what words do I need to find a specific flavor for? I’m going to go through them as I can think of them, and then compile at the end.</p>
<p>Having just watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JW7obfLcW9U">a video about Albert the Great</a>, I will accept that occult means hidden. That is, occult knowledge is not simply unused by virtue of being boring or just undesired; it is actively suppressed or kept from sight. I feel like I want a way to distinguish knowledge which is hidden on its own account and knowledge which is hidden by some deeper power. That’s something to keep in mind going forward.<a href="#fn0428" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>I really want the word eldritch to come with connotation of causing a fundamental change in the receiver. That is, knowledge is eldritch when being able to understand it means that you must see the rest of the world differently forever. I have a whole idea of a post about the idea that all knowledge is fundamentally eldritch, but then I think that I’ll get into something circular. For now, I’ll just stay with eldritch knowledge cannot be learned without changing oneself in a deep and permanent fashion.</p>
<p>Gnosis is a popular term whenever you talk to Gnostics or annoying Catholics.<a href="#fn0429" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref29"><sup>29</sup></a> It’s the Greek word for knowledge, but generally has a connotation of being secret. It also has a denotation, according to the internet, of being intuitive. From this, I’ll take the intuition portion. Knowledge is gnostic<a href="#fn0430" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref30"><sup>30</sup></a> when it can only be understood at an intuitive level. Or, at least, it is gnostic when it is understood at an intuitive level. Hmm, I feel like there’s a difference between fundamentally gnostic and practically gnostic words. Another place we might have an option.</p>
<p>Arcane is another word. Arcane just comes from “arcanum”, a second-declension noun meaning secret or mystery. I don’t really want to get into the whole “mystery means something different in the Catholic tradition”, but I’m happy for arcane knowledge to be information<a href="#fn0431" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref31"><sup>31</sup></a> which is counterintuitive or mysterious.</p>
<p>Ok I realize now (see above footnote)<a href="#fn0432" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref32"><sup>32</sup></a> that I need to reframe this entire post. So, Draft Two, here we go.</p>
<h1 id="daily-reflection-6-september-2025">Daily Reflection 6 September 2025</h1>

<li><p>Did you journal by hand today?</p>
<p>No, also not yesterday, for all that I had planned to.</p></li>
<li><p>Did you do a folly?</p>
<p>Not yesterday; not having WiFi<a href="#fn0433" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref33"><sup>33</sup></a> does a lot to prevent me from writing on my preferred site.</p></li>
<li><p>Did you in some way, shape, or form advance the web novel?</p>
<p>Not yesterday, but I have about half of it bound and the other half folded. I’m planning to spend some time tonight doing the rest of the binding, but I did also just bind a book for a friend, and so I don’t want to burn out of it.</p></li>
<li><p>Did you work on music, whether education or creation?</p>
<p>No, but I did listen to a lot and I made a playlist for a<a href="#fn0434" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref34"><sup>34</sup></a> future friend.</p></li>
<li><p>Did you work on book binding?</p>
<p>Yeah! As mentioned above.</p></li>
<li><p>Did you work on another hobby?</p>
<p>I packed! I also played some video games, which are a hobby for all that I don’t want them to be. Also I have been reading a lot of a web novel I really enjoy, “Chaotic Craftsman Worships the Cube”, which I hope to once again finish soon.</p></li>
<li><p>Did you stretch? Really?</p>
<p>Not a lot, but some! I will do more stretching when I get back to my apartment, but in order to get back to my apartment I need to accept an absence of WiFi or internet generally.<a href="#fn0435" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Not a lot, but I do still say a <em>Lux Aeterna</em><a href="#fn0436" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref36"><sup>36</sup></a> every time I go by a cemetery<a href="#fn0437" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref37"><sup>37</sup></a>, and I went to a Shabbat dinner last night, which included some explicit prayer.</p></li>
<li><p>Meditation?</p>
<p>I was felling incredibly stressed going to the Shabbat last night, and so I did some intentional breathing then. Other than that, I guess that I’m trying to quiet my mind before sleep lately. Right now I’m not wearing headphones and not listening to anything in particular, despite the fact that I am in public and so therefore near enough to people that I cannot say I’m in silence.</p></li>
<li><p>Reading?</p>
<p>Other than the web novel mentioned above, I caught back up with the book about soccer my brother and I enjoy.</p></li>
<li><p>Minimizing screen time?</p>
<p>Not at all! Wooo, go me. I will hopefully start on this later, when I can think on paper rather than here.<a href="#fn0438" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p></li>

<h1 id="monthly-reflection"><a href="reflection-august-25.html">Monthly Reflection</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2025 September 4</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-4-september-2025">Draft 1: 4 September 2025</h1>
<p>Another month gone by!</p>
<p>I finished my defense, which in retrospect was probably as all-consuming as I should have expected. Sadly, I did not keep up on this site, nor did I really do much of anything else. This next month, however, I have nothing scheduled other than travel and seeing friends, which means that I can get back to the things that are important to me in general situations. I don’t realllly feel like doing a look back at last month’s stuff, but that’s a part of the tradition so.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Oh, so the only stuff that I looked forward to was my defense and my birthday. Wait wait, my birthday was also last month. Wow that feels so very long ago, even if I can intellectually recognize that it wasn’t.</p>
<p>Anyways, I defended, and am therefore Dr. Let’s spend this space thinking about my monthly goals and daily goals and whatnot.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I want to do daily follies, and since I have nothing else scheduled, that should be doable? I have an idea to start making a dictionary of terms as I’m going to use them, because I don’t really care what the standard meaning of words is, especially in context of wanting to distinguish similar ideas. The more I learn about philosophers, the more it seems like that’s a thing that they do a lot, so as a Doctor of Philosophy<a href="#fn051" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, I too have that right.</p>
<p>As a child I used to be told that doctors get the right to make up new terms, which is something I plan to take advantage of as well.</p>
<p>I want to get back into my web novel, which will likely involve reading some emotionally charged notes from readers.<a href="#fn052" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In order to do that, I should like<a href="#fn053" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref3"><sup>3</sup></a> to reread the book, because I have forgotten much of it. Since I’m generally trying to be on screens less<a href="#fn054" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref4"><sup>4</sup></a>, I think that I’ll set it up to print and print it out today? That could be fun.</p>
<p>I want to get back into hobbies, even if I’m not sure which.</p>
<p>I have to write the song for a wedding, so that could be a thing that I should start on basically right away? I have the few books on composing that I have been wanting to read for a while, so can treat them together. I plan on binding the books for the different things that I want to read, which is a related, though distinct hobby.</p>
<p>Could be fun to bring a ball of yarn with me and just see whether I make anything fun out of it?<a href="#fn055" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Might as well.</p>
<p>I want to improve my physical health. Mostly, I think that means that I want to be stretching much more than I am, because oof am I unflexible and tight<a href="#fn056" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref6"><sup>6</sup></a>. Eating better is also an idea, though the fact that I’m traveling more or less non stop might make that a bit of a nonstarter. I could spend some time thinking of a good stretching routine. Right now I’m too inflexible in my shoulders that my default shoulder stretches seem terrifyingly difficult.</p>
<p>I want to read more, and especially more high brow stuff. With that in mind, I did also print out a bunch of books, and I have even more I’m planning to pack with me.</p>
<p>I should absolutely get into meditation and prayer again. I think that it would be good to attempt a few minutes of meditation and a few minutes of intentional prayer a day. I’m finding myself more and more unsure of my faith, and hopefully some thinking and sitting will help with that.</p>
<p>None of the other things in the daily reflection really speak to me, even if the pen list will probably stay because I am enjoying it right now. I don’t love the journals that I’m using for journaling right now, so will probably spend some time exploring different options. Might go back to my old one, might go to one of the many I’ve been gifted lately, might find some third option.</p>
<p>This means my daily reflection should look like:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did you journal by hand today?</p></li>
<li><p>Did you do a folly?</p></li>
<li><p>Did you in some way, shape, or form advance the web novel?</p></li>
<li><p>Did you work on music, whether education or creation?</p></li>
<li><p>Did you work on book binding?</p></li>
<li><p>Did you work on another hobby?</p></li>
<li><p>Did you stretch? Really?</p></li>
<li><p>Prayer?</p></li>
<li><p>Meditation?</p></li>
<li><p>Reading?</p></li>
<li><p>Minimizing screen time?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>and to answer:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did you journal by hand today?</p>
<p>No, but I think that I might count this.</p></li>
<li><p>Did you do a folly?</p>
<p>Behold.</p></li>
<li><p>Did you in some way, shape, or form advance the web novel?</p>
<p>I’m typesetting it now to be printed, and then will print it, and maybe even do some book binding of it?</p></li>
<li><p>Did you work on music, whether education or creation?</p>
<p>Nope!</p></li>
<li><p>Did you work on book binding?</p>
<p>Will do with the web novel.</p></li>
<li><p>Did you work on another hobby?</p>
<p>Uhhh I cleaned!</p></li>
<li><p>Did you stretch? Really?</p>
<p>No. I’ll do something quick now though.</p></li>
<li><p>Prayer?</p>
<p>Nope, will plan on soon though.</p></li>
<li><p>Meditation?</p>
<p>Nope.</p></li>
<li><p>Reading?</p>
<p>Yes!</p></li>
<li><p>Minimizing screen time?</p>
<p>Not in the slightest.</p>

<h1 id="monthly-reflection"><a href="reflection-july-25.html">Monthly Reflection</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2025 September 4 (whoops, never hit post)</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-2-august-2025">Draft 1: 2 August 2025</h1>
<p>Woo! Another month, another chance to realize that more than four weeks have passed me by. I am three weeks and two days away from my defense, which is horrifying. At the absolute minimum, I must give my committee a week to read the thesis, which means that I have just over two weeks to be fully finished with everthing. The travel this month has also messed me up schedule wise, and I’ve also not follied as much as I’d like. Or, I guess, the folly was not writing the follies?</p>
<p>Five things that excited me about this July:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Visiting a friend! Did it before July reflect</p></li>
<li><p>Giving a talk to some high schoolers. It went decently, but the host pointed out that I went a little fast. That’s good feedback, and something for me to remember going forward for sure.</p></li>
<li><p>Getting into a routine again!</p>
<p>I mean my sleep and eating was at least a little better, but I don’t know if I’d call it routine.</p></li>
<li><p>Going on a visit to the place I got a job offer for!</p>
<p>Visited! Was great.</p></li>
<li><p>Getting to give a talk on an island I’ve always wanted to visit!</p>
<p>Was just so much fun, apparently the entire island showed up. I almost missed the last ferry there because it turns out I actually needed to take two ferries.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Last month’s stuff:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Get back into the web novel: realized that I don’t have mental space for it right now. Am hoping that during September, when I’m also planning on doing a bunch of travel, I’ll feel up to it.</p></li>
<li><p>Get back into follies</p>
<p>Eh, did not do a great job with that.</p></li>
<li><p>Write journal daily</p>
<p>I journalled fairly often, but again, not as often as I would have liked.</p></li>
<li><p>Eat well</p>
<p>eh</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch</p>
<p>I did certainly get into more of a habit of this!</p></li>
<li><p>Sleep</p>
<p>I honestly think I did pretty decent in regards to sleep</p></li>
<li><p>Clean</p>
<p>Home is cleaner, life is more ordered</p></li>
<li><p>Research</p>
<p>Finally did<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> data analysis!</p></li>
<li><p>Creation</p>
<p>Thesis is a form of creation, and so is the music I made with friends.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This month, the only things I can think of happening are my birthday<a href="#fn062" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and my defense. However, I’m sure there will be more, which I can think about in the future.</p>

<h1 id="reflection-on-chemistry-education-readings-week-two"><a href="chemistry-education-research-2.html">Reflection on Chemistry Education Readings Week Two</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2025 July 21</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>This week’s readings were more generally about education, and I read them away from computer, so thoughts are a little more organized. First chapter was about the two major modes of behavioral learning: classical<a href="#fn071" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> which focuses on the stimuli causing action, and operant<a href="#fn072" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> which focuses on the rewards or punishment for a behavior. The second chapter focused on Piaget, and wow he’s even cooler than I thought.</p>
<p>My main takeaway from this week’s readings is that the authors are way too concerned with neoplatonism. That is, there was a major trend in Greek philosophy, especially that which we still have, of going “this is how the world should be, and places where reality differ from the model mean that reality is the problem not the model.” We inherit a lot of that, especially in context of tuning theory.<a href="#fn073" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In this case, though, I think that it’s particularly dumb.</p>
<p>Plato had this big idea of “people can’t learn things, they must already know them”, and the authors keep saying that Piaget’s theories fail to account for that issue. However, it’s only an issue if you make it one. Like very demonstrably we see things learn behavior and knowledge. It requires ignoring reality to construct the belief to make that happen.</p>
<p>I realize that this also comes into play with the whole modern philosophy “solipsism is internally consistent” that Descartes started. Rather than beginning with observable reality, he started with the Greek thing of “I know that I am”. The sense of I is not a universal thing.</p>
<p>Anyways, I generally found it interesting to see the developmental categories Piaget sorted us into, and it’s wild to me to remember that children can’t abstract at first. Not my favorite set of readings, but I do also know that I have a fairly strong implicit background in child psychology, because my grandmother did literally write books on the subject which were still used in coursework after she died. I also find myself consistently becoming less sympathetic to the philosophy of science treatments that I see in many sources.</p>
<p>These authors are unwilling to say that things are observable by proxy. If I follow their argument, they would argue that we cannot observe energy levels in molecules, because we cannot directly see them. We can only see transitions between them. I think direct observation is a weirdly high bar, especially since then we get the question of what it means to observe.</p>
<p>Is a photon hitting my eye an observation?</p>
<p>Is a photon hitting a detector one?</p>
<p>What’s the line between an observation and a proxy one? Most of the time what we measure is electrical current from photomultiplier tubes, not direct photons. Arguably under their interpretation, that means that any experiment with a PMT doesn’t actually observe things. Since they’re willing to go to solipsism, how can one even trust their senses?</p>
<h1 id="daily-reflection">Daily Reflection</h1>
<ol>
<li><p>Did you journal today?</p>
<p>Yes!</p></li>
<li><p>What ink/pen did you use, and what were your thoughts on it?</p>
<p>Pilot preppy platinum with private reserve electric dc blue.</p>
<p>I still find that my handwriting is messier like this.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s prayer?</p>
<p>Pretty minimal, but I did have mindful time when waiting for a prescription to be filled, so that was nice.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s focus?</p>
<p>Eh. I got two and a half great hours in and then struggled to restart</p></li>
<li><p>How’s sleep?</p>
<p>I took a three hour nap that felt absolutely essential which is not great. Still, I do feel at least a little better rested now!</p></li>
<li><p>How many meals, and how balanced?</p>
<p>For breakfast I had an iced red eye, for lunch I had pasta in butter sauce with spinach and peas. It was nice. For dinner I had tacos, rice, and beans<a href="#fn074" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref4"><sup>4</sup></a> at a bar where I did an open mic.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s the posture?</p>
<p>Fine?</p></li>
<li><p>How’s the breath?</p>
<p>Eh, could be better.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s the movement?</p>
<p>I had wanted to walk to open mic, but then lost track of time<a href="#fn075" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>How’s the physical flexibility?</p>
<p>Not fantastic, but a stretch  did help me to refocus during the day.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s keeping up with the family obligations?</p>
<p>Good! I’ve now listened through the album three(?) times.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s the thesis?</p>
<p>Decent, I finished the text of the apparatus chapter today, even if I didn’t manage to find/make the figures. That’s a tomorrow task, I guess.<a href="#fn076" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>How’s the poetry?</p>
<p>eh, wrote a bit ysterday night, have ideas for tongiht.</p></li>
<li><p>How’re the interpersonal relationships?</p>
<p>Good! Saw friends, got lunch with a friend, and am jamming tomorrow with some.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s the music?</p>
<p>Went to an open mic! Did Iowa (Traveling III) by Dar Williams, Inconsolable by Katie Gavin, and Maid on the Shore by Stan Rogers.</p>
<p>It was my first performance in a while and so mistakes were made. Friends in the crowd claimed not to be able to notice them, though, so that was nice of them.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s the other writing?</p>
<p>Bullet journal is weird for me because like, where do I take real notes? I guess in a notebook.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s the cleaning?</p>
<p>eh, minimal today, that’s something I don’t have energy for right now though.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s ordering the life?</p>
<p>I don’t know if bullet journal really helped that much, since I think that the barrier right now is entirely motivation, rather than scheduling or tracking.</p></li>
<li><p>Water?</p>
<p>Not as much!</p></li>

<h1 id="trying-bullet-journals"><a href="bullet-journal.html">Trying Bullet Journals</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2025 July 20</p>
<h1 id="daily-reflection-20-july-2025">Daily Reflection: 20 July 2025</h1>
<p>As my post the other day implies, I am someone who easily loses track of time and place. I want that not to be the case, but don’t know how to make that happen.</p>
<p>Historically most methods haven’t worked for me.</p>
<p>I’ve found pretty good and continuous luck over the past month doing a clipboard, so I’m hoping that it continues with a bullet journal. Rather than having pages for each thing, I will go back to the method I used when I began journaling: strict chronology. Each day gets one full page, and I have a few other pages for reminders and notes.</p>
<p>Since, for all intents and purposes, my planning ends in a month and a few days, I don’t really care if this method means that I lose track of events that would happen in three or so months. It is very important to me that I get through this thesis, and I realized today that it is also really important to me that it be long. With that in mind, I think that the new method is something that I can force myself to be doing for the next thirtyish days.</p>
<p>So, what is bullet journaling?</p>
<p>Great question</p>
<p>Came from a guy with ADHD, has become an entire aesthetic. Generally as far as I can tell the idea is to have an externalization of the brain in one place with dedicated time and space to clean the thoughts into something reasonable.</p>
<p>I’ve got a page where I have the day and day of the week for the remainder of my schedule, when I’m traveling and where, and this week’s goals for habits. This week’s habit goals are: stretch twice, meditation of some sort, blogging, writing poetry, penmanship, typing, and reading. I want to do most of them daily, but penmanship and typing are both effectively every other day events.</p>
<p>This page and the following cleaned pages are stored in a folder.</p>
<p>Following that, I have a page with my ideas for blogs. I’m currently reading a book about women in science and it’s sparked some great blog ideas.<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Behind that, List of all Tasks! I plan to update that daily</p>
<p>Behind that, list of books that seem interesting, so that I don’t forget they exist</p>
<p>Behind that I currently have a weekly plan/reality log? I’m not sure what this will do for me, and it’s likely that I’ll ignore and or get rid of it.</p>
<p>Behind that I have the daily pen choice, whose main idea is that it will help me figure out when I wrote things based on the pen they’re written in. The six pens I’m currently working through mean that it will be just over weekly that each one repeats, so anything that’s less than a week away is uniquely identified by when I wrote it.</p>
<p>Behind that I have an empty page for each day until next Monday<a href="#fn082" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, except for today’s and tomorrow’s, because I’m planning on actively writing those.</p>
<p>Outside of the folder, I have the rest of the clipboard.</p>
<p>Right now that’s my notes on the book I’m reading, an optimistic page for me to write poetry on<a href="#fn083" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, today’s messy page, which has some tasks and a bunch of notes, and the penmanship page, which I’ve done some work to fill. I know that most of the books I’ve been flipping through with a friend don’t just have repetition of letters, because it’s both too much of a task, being multiple actions, and also too little, not being a full word. Still, I think that my e is slightly more consistent and that my “a” is maybe a little better? I realize I don’t know what I want the a to look like or write like though.<a href="#fn084" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Somewhere I’ve also tomorrow’s page, and my hope and plan is to write it tonight and then journal and confirm it tomorrow morning before getting outside.</p>
<p>Aha it is in the back of the folder.</p>
<p>Well, let’s hope this works!</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Did you journal today?</p>
<p>Yeah! I spent some time in the early afternoon, when I started doing my things for the day. I then also started getting through some ideas of work, and so started a bullet journal! I think that’s what it is, at least, and will discuss it in the post<a href="#fn085" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>What ink/pen did you use, and what were your thoughts on it?</p>
<p>Today’s pen was the Kaweko Sport, and I have almost finished its ink. I think that it was the private reserve chocolat or potentially vampire red. it is not quite empty, but I’m planning on practicing penmanship until it is empty. Wait no, because I wanted to do some journaling and poetry tonight with it. Whoop.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s prayer?</p>
<p>Eh. I tried to go through a rosary and I don’t remember what stopped me.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s focus?</p>
<p>Eh. I got through the rest of the introduction, but wow I have no motivation for the apparatus section. Writing that down now, I guess that’s absolutely something that I can just push through, so I should plan on that tomorrow.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s sleep?</p>
<p>Generally fine. I didn’t get to sleep until like 1 this morning, but then woke up on my own at like half past eight.  I haven’t napped today, but I’m planning to go to bed before 2200.</p></li>
<li><p>How many meals, and how balanced?</p>
<p>Since yesterday’s, I had dinner at a supper club, which was a ribeye, “irish potatoes”<a href="#fn086" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref6"><sup>6</sup></a>, and salad. This morning I made what I think can be described as congee: handful of frozen onion and celery, some peas, green beans, three brats cut small and then a large handful of rice<a href="#fn087" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref7"><sup>7</sup></a> which I put on the stove until it made a nice pasty thing. Tasted fine, probably full of nutrients.</p>
<p>Since then I’ve had an espresso tonic, a peppermint French soda, some tea, and will be eating a polish sausage<a href="#fn088" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>How’s the posture?</p>
<p>I kept catching myself hunching over while reading this afternoon. My upper shoulders and lower neck remain so very tight, though.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s the breath?</p>
<p>I honestly think pretty good! I’ve been reminding myself to breathe, especially on the long drive back home.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s the movement?</p>
<p>Eh! I walked the mile and a half to a coffee shop this early afternoon, and then walked to work, which is effectively back home. That’s still about three miles total, though, which is not nothing!</p></li>
<li><p>How’s the physical flexibility?</p>
<p>I stretched a bunch.  Oof I am tight and tender. I might try stretching more tomorrow, especially if I remember.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s keeping up with the family obligations?</p>
<p>Called the brothers! Will listen to the album while walking home.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s the thesis?</p>
<p>Last night I read through the RebelFit chapter, and then today I finished editing the introduction, printed it out again to make sure it seems fine<a href="#fn089" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref9"><sup>9</sup></a>. As mentioned above, have not been able to force myself onto the apparatus, even though it’s one of two remaining chapters, and the other remaining chapter requires me to have finished calculations, which is yet to happen. Then again, I can probably make at least some of the charts? Something to think about for tomorrow.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s the poetry?</p>
<p>None, but I made a new sheet for it.</p></li>
<li><p>How’re the interpersonal relationships?</p>
<p>Keep messaging people. I am getting lunch with someone tomorrow, so it’s important that I pack myself something reasonable for lunch, because the gaze of the other is terrifying to me.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s the music?</p>
<p>Listened to some! A new current favorite song is Babylon by the Dirt Poor Robins. Otherwise, I’ve agreed to make a playlist of folk music to trade someone for a playlist of house music. I have no idea how long or crafted that playlist will be, but can make one soon. Might be a good topic of folly, depending on timing.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s the other writing?</p>
<p>Started a bullet journal! THat’s pretty cool, and even did some penmanship work too. I don’t know how well externalizing thoughts is going to go, especially with the nightly camping thing, but it’ll be something to try, at least.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s the cleaning?</p>
<p>Eh, minorly better.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s ordering the life?</p>
<p>Decent! We’ll see if the bullet journaling works.</p></li>
<li><p>Water?</p>
<p>Ok! I drank a fair amount last night and then had some today.</p></li>

<ol>
<li><p>Did you journal a full page today?</p>
<p>Not a full page, but about half of one!</p></li>
<li><p>What ink/pen did you use, and what were your thoughts on it?</p>
<p>I used the Pilot Preppy, which I think still has the Private Reserve Blue. I continue to really like the color, but for some reason I noticed that my writing was far messier today than it has tended to be lately. I’m not sure if that’s a function of starting writing after a full breakfast and coffee, the fact that my chair is so low, or something in the nib itself, but it is interesting to note regardless.</p>
<p>I do also think that the Pilot is my finest nib. I’m somewhat curious how large it ends up being. Looks like somewhere between a .2 and .3 mm stroke, which makes sense, because that is the thickness that I do in general really like, and the minor flex means that they won’t all be the same width. The others pens are, of course thicker. The job that I’m taking offers pens in 0.5 and 0.7 mm, so that’s probably also good for me to get used to.</p>
<p>Still, I don’t like how messy the penmanship was today, so it might behoove<a href="#fn0811" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref11"><sup>11</sup></a> me to practice some penmanship.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s prayer?</p>
<p>Not really happening. Probably worthwhile to set a reminder to do it. I have to move my car soon<a href="#fn0812" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref12"><sup>12</sup></a> so that might be a great time to go ahead and say a quick prayer. Then again, I’ve also been at this coffee shop for the better part of the parking limit, so maybe I should also get something else if I’m coming back...</p></li>
<li><p>How’s focus?</p>
<p>Generally decent.</p>
<p>I read a full book this morning which is just absolutely wild<a href="#fn0813" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Since being at the coffee shop, I’ve managed to get some journaling, a full hand-edit<a href="#fn0814" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref14"><sup>14</sup></a> and about a third of the typed edits for the Introduction chapter. I got so burned out<a href="#fn0815" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref15"><sup>15</sup></a> at that point, and so now I’m going to do this until it’s time for me to move my car.<a href="#fn0816" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>I assume that getting up and walking a bit will help.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s sleep?</p>
<p>Since last post, I went to bed at around 1230<a href="#fn0817" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref17"><sup>17</sup></a>, and then woke up for a fun two or three hours at around 2. I was up before the 830 alarm I set, even if it did take me a while to accept that and longer to leave bed.</p>
<p>Right now I don’t feel tired, and I didn’t feel bad about driving home from the talk last night, which is two great signs.</p></li>
<li><p>How many meals, and how balanced?</p>
<p>Uh I had some fried chicken for dinner last night. I’ll say that’s probably fine-ish, since it is still primarily fat and protein, with some non-sugar carbs.</p>
<p>This morning, the hotel breakfast<a href="#fn0818" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref18"><sup>18</sup></a> was a thing of chobani strawberry yogurt, a disposable cup of coffee, two things of chocolate milk, two what they called beignets<a href="#fn0819" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref19"><sup>19</sup></a>, eggs with cheese I added, some bacon<a href="#fn0820" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref20"><sup>20</sup></a>, a thing of orange juice, and a waffle with butter and syrup.</p>
<p>That’s honestly much more food than I think that it felt like at the time, and also far more food than it seems now. Oh! Also some berries.</p>
<p>One of the milks and the yogurt technically got consumed about two hours after the rest of the food, but who’s keeping track?<a href="#fn0821" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>At the cafe, I’ve had a raspberry italian soda, but yesterday I got a sweet crepe here and it was delicious. I’m tempted to get another today, and might do on of their savory options.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s the posture?</p>
<p>Generally fine.</p>
<p>I’m sitting with my legs crossed and was spending some time not so much sitting up, but that’s partially to be blamed on how tall this table is relative to its chair. Then again, not having my forearms needing to arc down as much is also pretty nice.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s the breath?</p>
<p>Eh, I just took. am taking fie deepish breaths, and they’re nice.</p>
<p>The more I do intentional breath, the better I feel, which does imply it is something that I should be focusing on more than I do. Then again, the more things that I focus on, the less that I can focus on any individual thing.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s the movement?</p>
<p>I move minimally, and haven’t really stood up since sitting down for to start writing. That’s not great, so let’s actually call it here, stand up, move the car a little early, and then return to our seat and get a little more work done, this time around taking a break every hourish. Or, at least, we can treat that as a goal<a href="#fn0822" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Little bit of walking did really do a lot to perk me back up<a href="#fn0823" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref23"><sup>23</sup></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s the physical flexibility?</p>
<p>Eh, could be better. I stretched in the shower this morning<a href="#fn0824" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref24"><sup>24</sup></a> and just did another forward fold during the walk. Little bit of neck stretching as I sit here.</p>
<p>The fact that my legs are crossing is more proof I should stretch my hips out more. Probably a thing to do at the park tonight.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s keeping up with the family obligations?</p>
<p>Honestly and legitimately decent!</p>
<p>I call the brothers tomorrow and I have the new album as of last night, so could do that while doing some stretching today/tonight/tomorrow.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s the thesis?</p>
<p>Oof, as yesterday’s folly points out, I am nowhere near where I wanted to be<a href="#fn0825" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref25"><sup>25</sup></a>. However, I got through what I wanted to do yesterday, I think. I printed out the chapter this morning<a href="#fn0826" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref26"><sup>26</sup></a> and also the introduction.</p>
<p>Working through intro right now, it does honestly feel pretty solid, but of course the more pictures I put in the better, as always<a href="#fn0827" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>Oh! I keep wanting to do the whole “use a layout that I didn’t make myself” thing, so this could be a great time to do that!</p>
<p>Despite my claim that the motivation is back, maybe it isn’t as close to back as I wanted.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s the poetry?</p>
<p>Didn’t write any yesterday or this morning, but would like to today after finishing with work<a href="#fn0828" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref28"><sup>28</sup></a>, if nothing else ends up taking the time.</p></li>
<li><p>How’re the interpersonal relationships?</p>
<p>I chatted with the other people at the talk yesterday, including the no-longer-solely-volunteer who coordinated it<a href="#fn0829" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>How’s the music?</p>
<p>Uh I don’t really think I did any since last time I’ve been writing. I don’t even think that I listened to any music last night. I did walk into a music store and resist the urge to buy anything, so if anything, one might be accurate in saying that I did negative music.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s the other writing?</p>
<p>Uh, I think that’s really it. Haven’t texted too many people, the hand edits on my thesis are thesis.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s the cleaning?</p>
<p>Wow I’m good at getting the hotel room packed in just a matter of seconds. I was completely spread out<a href="#fn0830" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref30"><sup>30</sup></a> and even still managed to get everything in its</p></li>
<li><p>How’s ordering the life?</p>
<p>Uh, I don’t really think that I’ve done any of that. Yesterday’s post was helpful in that regard, to be certain. Otherwise, I think that prayer<a href="#fn0831" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref31"><sup>31</sup></a> and finishing this are the big ones. Oh, planning travel, but I think that I’m doing that tomorrow.</p>
<p>Also, I want a nicer clicker, so I just got it.<a href="#fn0832" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Water?</p>
<p>Really good! I’ve had to refill the monster jug, and I even am occasionally remembering to just like drink it.</p></li>

<p>First Published: 2025 July 18</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-18-july-2025">Draft 1: 18 July 2025</h1>
<p>As far as most of my time should be concerned, I have thirty eight days. In thirty eight days I defend my thesis, which means that in twenty four days my committee needs to have a full and polished version of my thesis. In ten days my advisor needs the same.</p>
<p>What do I know will be taking time in the next thirty eight days? Or, since hours are more what I care about, it’s 1600 or so now. There are thirteen days left in July after this, 320 hours. I sleep for about ten hours a night<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, so that’s really like 180 hours of real time. In August, I have 586 hours until the defense, but again we must sleep, and so 336 hours.</p>
<p>In the next 516 hours what do I need to accomplish?</p>
<p>I need to finish writing my thesis. I need to make the entire thesis presentation. I need to finish the research for the paper I’m trying to publish.</p>
<p>In the next 516 hours, what other commitments do I have?</p>
<p>I<a href="#fn092" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> agreed to give talks every weekend from now until the defense. I’m going to assume an average travel time of five hours each direction<a href="#fn093" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, so ten hours per weekend will be gone, on the road. Fifty five fewer hours, I have 461 hours.</p>
<p>Each day in the weekend I give an outreach talk that lasts an hour, and then have observing for between 0 and 2 hours.<a href="#fn094" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref4"><sup>4</sup></a> I also like being there<a href="#fn095" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref5"><sup>5</sup></a> an hour early, so let’s average that to three hours per talk. Fourteen talks means 42 hours, 419 hours.</p>
<p>Just over four hundred hours of time is what I have left. I had been picking up hobbies again, and I think that I might need to stop that, at least for now.<a href="#fn096" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref6"><sup>6</sup></a> I do know that I cannot work nonstop forever, though. If I think about when things are due, what deadlines do I need for myself to be successful?</p>
<p>Let’s once again list out what the thesis is, needs, and contains:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Minimum Viable Thesis Document<a href="#fn097" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Abstract</p></li>
<li><p>Introduction</p></li>
<li><p>Acknowledgements</p></li>
<li><p>Apparatus</p></li>
<li><p>RebelFit</p></li>
<li><p>Conclusions</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Desired Things:<a href="#fn098" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Chapter on Outreach</p></li>
<li><p>Publicly accessible Chapter</p></li>
<li><p>Derivation of Watson T and <span class="math inline"><em>ρ</em></span> values</p></li>
<li><p>Explanation of algorithms<a href="#fn099" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Derivation of Rotational Spectroscopy</p></li>
<li><p>Philosophy of Science</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Things that I need for the presentation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I mean honestly, I hope that what I present will come entirely from the thesis paper, so that’s probably fine for now. Since I turn the final thesis in on 8/11, I have the next two weeks to make the presentation.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>How long will each thing take? Great question.</p>
<p>In four hundred and nineteen hours, I need to write an entire abstract, which will take under three hours unless something goes catastrophically wrong. In four hundred and sixteen hours, I need to write an acknowledgement of at least some of the infinitely many things and people that have brought me to this point, which will take as long as I give it, as gratitude tends to. Grateful as I am, though, I cannot give it more than six.</p>
<p>With four hundred and ten remaining hours, I need to finish the introduction. I wanted to rephrase and rewrite a lot of it, which would likely take under five hours. I need to add some missing citations and add figures where needed. Citations should take under thirty more minutes at minimum<a href="#fn0910" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref10"><sup>10</sup></a>, and the needed figures probably take under three hours. Four hundred and one or four hundred and six. I want this thesis to be something I’m proud of.</p>
<p>With four hundred remaining hours, I need to write effectively the entire apparatus section, cite it appropriately, and add the needed figures. I think that I have most of the figures I would need. There are fourish<a href="#fn0911" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref11"><sup>11</sup></a> instruments/apparatus that I’ll be writing about. At most it should take an hour each to make the figures. I do really think that I can get a minimally viable text in under two hours. If I wanted to write a full description of each instrument, though, that will take much longer, and I don’t care that much about any of them right now.</p>
<p>Three hundred and ninety four hours<a href="#fn0912" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref12"><sup>12</sup></a> are left in my life. I need to have a full version of the conclusions and next steps. I sent in a draft of it that feels mostly finished, but I’ll assume another four hours for that.</p>
<p>Three hundred and ninety hours to finish with RebelFit. I need to absolutely finish the paper, and I absolutely need to finish the paper. The only things left are adding in the proof that it works, I think, which requires the jobs to run and me to at least minimally analyze the output. I’m hopeful that the reviewer is ok with tentative, rather than explicit, assignment of the new states, but we’ll see what happens.</p>
<p>Three hundred and eighty five hours to rewrite all of the RebelFit portion of my thesis. I think that I have all the content I would need, and I even think that I have most of the figures.<a href="#fn0913" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Let’s be generous to the productivity I am capable of and assume that it takes me three hours to get the current content into something sensible, and then under thirty to finish revisions.</p>
<p>Three hundred and fifty hours. That’s honestly more time than I thought. Still, that’s not enough time for me to really feel comfortable slacking off, so time to start work again. I have to head to the park at about six, and I do also need to eat<a href="#fn0914" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref14"><sup>14</sup></a>, so I have about one hundred minutes left to work today. What can I get done then?</p>
<p>Hopefully at the very least the daily reflection and getting RebelFit into something resembling a sensible thesis chapter.</p>
<h1 id="draft-0-18-july-2025-blog-title-on-the-absence-of-routine">Draft 0: 18 July 2025 (blog title: on (the absence of) routine</h1>
<p>Routines are incredibly helpful and important to and for me.<a href="#fn0915" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Despite that, as the absence of daily posts here illustrates, I have not generally done a great job of having a routine lately. Some of this is understandable: I had a conference and then it was the Fourth of July. However, in 10 days I need to have finished my thesis, and that feels like an optimistic goal, which it really shouldn’t.<a href="#fn0916" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Since I know that I am more productive in times of routine, it felt like a good idea to use this folly to explore routine. However, that’s no longer feeling right, because wow two weeks is much closer than it feels. I kind of do really feel like I need to be delivering something at least daily, if not moreso.<a href="#fn0917" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h1 id="draft--1-18-july-2025">Draft -1: 18 July 2025</h1>
<p>As the sporadic and mostly absent nature of this site probably attests,<a href="#fn0918" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref18"><sup>18</sup></a> I do not currently have a good routine going. There are any number of reasons for that, but most of them boil down to the fact that, unlike what makes a good routine for me, every day is not like every other. However, I’m now in the final weeks before my thesis defense, which means that on some level the routine maybe should just be a baseline level of panic and stress. Given that I’m not feeling that, I can only conclude that I need to be more aware of what time I do and do not have.</p>
<p>So, let’s quickly get the timeline established, and then we can start thinking about routine again.</p>
<p>My thesis defense is on August 25 at 10am. I am supposed to give my committee two weeks to read the thesis, which means that they need it by August 11. I want two weeks between the final rounds of my boss’s edits and giving it to the committee, which means she needs the full thesis by July 28. That is, in the next ten days I need to be completely finished with my thesis.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>That’s um, a lot sooner than it emotionally feels. So, what could a routine look like for me?</p>
<p>Right now I have outreach talks every weekend. I do find that I can be at least somewhat productive while traveling, both because driving helps me order my thoughts and just because I can kind of write from anywhere. Unfortunately, driving is also a fairly large time sink. This weekend is one of my shorter drives and is still five hours of driving.</p>
<p>Ok wow I’m falling out of the planned post, let’s try this again.</p>
<h1 id="daily-reflection">Daily Reflection</h1>
<ol>
<li><p>Did you journal a full page today?</p>
<p>One sentence, because I thought while driving.</p></li>
<li><p>What ink/pen did you use, and what were your thoughts on it?</p>
<p>Fude with Neon yellow. I think that I don’t like the PR<a href="#fn0919" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref19"><sup>19</sup></a> neons are almost highlighter, and definitely need the thicker nib. However, even so I don’t like how pale/translucent they are.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s prayer?</p>
<p>Non-existent. I stopped by a coffee shop for caffeine earlier this afternoon, and heard two women discussing Catholicism, which did remind me to pray before eating.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s focus?</p>
<p>Oof, this post is revitalizing it really well.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s sleep?</p>
<p>Always I feel too tired.</p></li>
<li><p>How many meals, and how balanced?</p>
<p>Uhhh great question. Today I had two western omelet sandwiches and a flavored coffee drink for breakfast, and then cold brew and a crepe with strawberries and chocolate for late lunch.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s the posture?</p>
<p>Generally ok!</p></li>
<li><p>How’s the breath?</p>
<p>I remind myself to breathe sometimes even when I’m not doing this reflection.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s the movement?</p>
<p>Not enough.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s the physical flexibility?</p>
<p>Nowhere near enough. Oof.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s keeping up with the family obligations?</p>
<p>Good!</p></li>
<li><p>How’s the thesis?</p>
<p>As you can maybe tell from the above, great question.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s the poetry?</p>
<p>Nonexistent.</p></li>
<li><p>How’re the interpersonal relationships?</p>
<p>Honestly kind of great. I am more sociable these days, and have made friends and connections with people at a bar I like in town. I met up with friends multiple times this week, and I’m reaching out to future coworkers.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s the music?</p>
<p>Honestly also good, I jammed with a friend earlier this week and we’d meant to do an open mic yesterday. (It was cancelled)</p></li>
<li><p>How’s the other writing?</p>
<p>Nonexistent, which is where it should be. I do want to tell the readers of my web novel that I’m not in a mental space to write it right now, but even that feels too hard, which is sad.</p></li>
<li><p>How’s the cleaning?</p>
<p>I need to do better at that</p></li>
<li><p>How’s ordering the life?</p>
<p>I mean this post is decent at least!</p></li>
<li><p>Water?</p>
<p>Better than it has been, worse than it could be.</p></li>
