<p>First Published: 2023 September 13</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As I mentioned <a href="talk-planning-eclipse-1">yesterday</a>, I have done a number of things during my downtime from blogging. I’d say one of the most fun of them was going to a friend’s euchre tournament last Saturday.<a href="#fn001" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>I think that I knew how to play euchre before the tournament, though I’m not entirely sure if I ever actually did. For those who don’t already know what euchre is, it’s a trick taking game. As far as I’ve ever played it, it has four players.<a href="#fn002" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> The deck is comprised of a standard deck of cards, though with only cards 9 and higher.</p>
<p>Each hand is played in the same way. The dealer passes out five cards to each player, then turns up the top card of the remainder. If someone wants that to be the trump suit, they tell the dealer to pick it up, at which point it becomes trump, and the dealer gets to replace any card in their hand with it.<a href="#fn003" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> From there, the person to the dealer’s left leads with the first trick. If no one tells the dealer to pick it up, the card is discarded and everyone once more goes around and can choose to pick trump. If no one does the second time through, there</p>
<p>Points are scored at the end of each hand. If your team<a href="#fn004" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> took a majority of the tricks<a href="#fn005" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>, you get a point. You get another point for taking all five tricks, and another if the other team called trump. I’m told there’s also a benefit if you choose to go alone, though that was banned at the tournament I went to.</p>
<p>For those who’ve never played a trick taking game, the general rules are that high cards win a trick. Each trick’s suit is the suit that the first player led with<a href="#fn006" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>. However, the trump suit always beats any other suit.</p>
<p>In euchre, you are mandated to play in suit if you can, including if you have trump in your hand. That’s an interesting variation, and one that I’ll have to consider more as I keep playing it. I’m sure that it does things to the strategy that I did not immediately think about.</p>
<p>Euchre also introduces an interesting variation on trump, where the Jack of trump suit becomes the highest value card. The second highest value card is the jack of the other same colored suit.<a href="#fn007" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn008" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> After that, trump goes down ace, king, queen, 10, 9. It’s kind of fun that jack goes from being a middling card to the best one if and only if the suit is trump. I’m not sure how that impacts when you should have the dealer pick up the card, but I am certain that it will.</p>
<p>Ok so, explanation of euchre out of the way, let’s talk about the tournament. Of the twelve participants, three had played before, and I vaguely knew the rules of trick taking games. I ended up on a team with one of my group mates, and we got absolutely destroyed in the first game. I primarily blame luck for that, as it’s hard to win a game when you don’t have any trump cards in your hand.</p>
<p>The winning teams all rotated, and the second game began. Just as time was running out, we were down one point. I was dealer, and I gave myself<a href="#fn009" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> the ace, queen, and jack of spades, along with the jack of clubs. I also had the nine of clubs, but that doesn’t matter as much. What’s most important is that the card that declared suit was the king of spades.</p>
<p>Obviously, no one else wanted spades to be trump<a href="#fn0010" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> When the choice came to me, I, obviously, took it, and immediately declared that we had taken all five tricks as time was called for the game. That lucky streak remained in our next game, and we ended up winning 2/3 games, which put us in second place.<a href="#fn0011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> It was a really fun time, and then the hosts took us to their back yard for a fire.</p>
<p>The fire was incredible, especially because they had some fancy fire pit with holes in the bottom, which means that the fire both never suffocated and also burned incredibly hot and fast. The fact that the wood was incredibly dry probably helped that, but it was mesmerizing to watch the flames.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I’m watching a blender tutorial after this, which is progress, if only meta.</p></li>
<li><p>I’m going to clean after the blender tutorial! That is some fighting against entropy.</p></li>
<li><p>Blogging streak is returning, which is great and fun and exciting and happy.</p></li>
<li><p>I actually did stretch, which is wild to me. It felt nice, but wow is my entire body stiff. I should stretch again tonight.</p></li>
<li><p>No exercise today, but I did walk, which is good.</p></li>
<li><p>I went to bed a little late last night, but set the alarm for much later.</p></li>
<li><p>I woke up before my alarm and everything!</p></li>
<li><p>I’m not sure that I’m not sick, so I stayed out of the chapel on purpose today.</p></li>
<li><p>If I write more Jeb today, which I plan to, I will be ahead, which is nice.</p></li>
<li><p>Book remains totally plotted, though I have been considering dropping the total number of chapters from 500 to 400 or even 300. At a rate of three chapters per day, there are a little under two and a half years left in the book. I would rather it be done before then, which either means I need to have fewer chapters or release them faster.<a href="#fn0012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Every hundred chapters I drop is about two thirds of a year less, which is weird to think about.</p>
<p>In actual reasoning, though, I’m not sure if the third, fourth, and fifth sentences describing the book actually need and deserve their own total arcs.</p></li>
<li><p>No poetry, for all that I should.</p></li>
<li><p>Oh gosh, that’s something I keep forgetting to do. I will work on my album after cleaning and tutorial.</p></li>
<li><p>I just now wrote 5 things I like about myself.</p></li>
<li><p>I just now wrote three things I’m excited for.</p></li>
<li><p>As above, just wrote ten more things I’m grateful for.</p></li>
<li><p>I think that in general I’ve been doing pretty well cultivating joy. I certainly am living more in the present, which is nice.</p></li>

<h1 id="talk-planning-eclipse"><a href="talk-planning-eclipse-1.html">Talk Planning (Eclipse)</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 September 12</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>First, sorry about the sudden radio silence. If I had to blame anything, I would blame the combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Getting suddenly busy<a href="#fn011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="spoons-2">getting out of mental space</a>.<a href="#fn012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Without further ado, though, I do have another talk in<a href="#fn013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> just over three weeks. With twenty something days to go, it feels like an appropriate time to shift my planning from completely analog to something with a bit more structure. I’ll be giving a talk on the eclipses that are coming up. I think I’ve mentioned on here before<a href="#fn014" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>, but there are four upcoming eclipses on the continental US.<a href="#fn015" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> In order, these are a partial solar eclipse on October 14, a partial lunar eclipse on October 28, a penumbral lunar eclipse on March 25, and a total solar eclipse on April 8 (the first since 2017, and the last until<a href="#fn016" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> 2044).<a href="#fn017" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>There are a lot of ways that I could frame an eclipse talk. Having now talked to a number of people who have materials prepared, I realize that I don’t love most of the ways that they do. Being, as I am<a href="#fn018" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>, myself, the way that I’m choosing to frame the talk is by answering the following questions<a href="#fn019" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>What is an eclipse?<a href="#fn0110" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>How many kinds of eclipse are there?<a href="#fn0111" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Why do eclipses happen?<a href="#fn0112" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Why don’t eclipses happen?<a href="#fn0113" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>How do we know when eclipses will happen?<a href="#fn0114" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>So, really, only one of those questions actually requires any effort from me. My “What is an eclipse” slide<a href="#fn0115" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> will just be a picture of a pretty eclipse with the text definition of one. My “How many kinds” slides or section will be a picture of each kind with a description of how they work.<a href="#fn0116" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> My “Why do they happen” slide will just be “wow we’re truly blessed.” My “How do we know” is also pretty easy. Like, the answer is really just pattern matching,<a href="#fn0117" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> and the hardest part will be not going off on a rant about harmonics (see footnote).</p>
<p>Now, of course, you’ll notice that I did not talk about “Why don’t they happen?”. And that’s because the answer is really hard.</p>
<p>Ok, so, without graphics. The sun exists. That feels like a good place to start. Since we live in a vaguely heliocentric world<a href="#fn0118" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>, everything we care about exists in reference to the sun.</p>
<p>Now, we also know that there is an earth. The Earth, in fact.<a href="#fn0119" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> The Earth moves around the sun.</p>
<p>Now, there are some fun things about that. Imagine if the Earth didn’t rotate at all.<a href="#fn0120" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> We would have one day every year. That would be really bad, I think.<a href="#fn0121" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> Even worse, though, the Earth could be tidally locked, which would mean that, at least in respect to the sun, the earth never rotated. Ope, actually, since we’re saying that the sun is the point of reference, we can thankfully ignore the Earth being stationary from an above inertial reference frame.<a href="#fn0122" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Ok so we have the sun. The sun is orbited by the Earth. If the Earth was tidally locked<a href="#fn0123" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> we would have half the earth bathed in flame and half bathed in ice.<a href="#fn0124" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> Instead, we are lucky that the Earth rotates about four hundred times per rotation around the sun.<a href="#fn0125" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>Now, if the Earth rotated around the sun without a tilt, there would be no seasons.<a href="#fn0126" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> Of course, as we know, we have seasons, which means that we orbit at a tilt. That does then raise the question of what a day is. After all, if you’re on either of the poles, there would be entire calendar days with no apparent change in the location of the sun in the sky.<a href="#fn0127" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> Also, anywhere you are, a fun thing to do is to find that the sun sets later on the days following the longest day of the year than it did on that day. That’s because the day is more than 24 hours during that point. Oh cool, the length of a day can vary by as much as 8 seconds during the course of the earth’s orbit. Hmm, that doesn’t explain why sun sets later.</p>
<p>Oh gosh, it has to do with incident tilt of the earth and therefore apparent amounts of sunlight, along with the fact that the amount of sunshine we get is shifted slightly later, I guess. That is way more than I ever wanted to know and learn, at least for this talk, so I guess I have to leave out the fun fact about how the sun sets later.</p>
<p>Diversions aside, we now have the sun and the earth, which rotates at its tilt across the sun. It’s at this point I want to use blender to animate, because I do not want to hand animate this, and also my ability to animate in python is very limited.<a href="#fn0128" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> But, more importantly, we then add in the moon.</p>
<p>So, first of all, if the moon was the wrong angular size in the sky, we would have much different numbers of eclipses. Shoot, I’ll have to discuss angular size here. Actually, is that the first place to go? I think that the first place I should do it is by going “ok so the moon is actually bound to the earth, rather than the sun, which feels weird.”</p>
<p>The moon is tidally locked to the earth, so we only see one face. If you think of it like a mirror, we can see a full moon when it’s opposite the earth from the sun, and we see a new moon when the moon is between the earth and the sun. This is where the question of why not all eclipses becomes relevant.</p>
<p>So first, we have size on sky. If moon big, more solar eclipses. If moon very big, no chance for total lunar.</p>
<p>But, of course, assumption will start with everything in the same plane, because of course it will. Instead, moon orbits earth at an angle. Because of that, we can only have the intersection at certain times of year. This is really what I want the animation for, because the two dimensional static drawings aren’t totally helpful.</p>
<p>Anyways, a friend also said that if I’m interested in public outreach generally, I should start a youtube channel and post my talks there. It’s not a bad idea, for all that I know it would make me incredibly neurotic.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is progress!</p></li>
<li><p>Kind of fought entropy. I meal prepped this past Sunday, which also did a lot to give me food for the week.</p></li>
<li><p>Terrible at blogging. Whoopse</p></li>
<li><p>I’ve been stretching off and on as parts of me hurt.</p></li>
<li><p>I have been as active as someone rushing from point a to b thoughtlessly is.</p></li>
<li><p>I’ve been trying to prioritize sleep, though I know that I did not on Friday or Saturday.</p></li>
<li><p>I have been needing my alarms to wake up every morning.</p></li>
<li><p>I have not prayed really at all.</p></li>
<li><p>Book chapters are coming out at the last possible moment.</p></li>
<li><p>I mean the net progress is still there I guess.</p></li>
<li><p>Poetry doesn’t happen.</p></li>
<li><p>I played around with the song a little bit, but nothing explicitly for the album.</p></li>
<li><p>I did not do the things I like, excite, or grateful since the last blog post. Tomorrow morning, I guess.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s been a struggle to cultivate being, let alone being joyful.</p></li>

<li id="fn0111" role="doc-endnote"><p>ok so there’s solar and lunar, which is two. There’s partial and total, which applies to both, so four.

I don’t know if a partial penumbral eclipse is a meaningful kind, but I still see at least five kinds of eclipse when I quickly google (partial and total solar, partial, total, and penumbral lunar.<a href="#fn01ref11" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0112" role="doc-endnote"><p>lunar eclipses: Earth gets in the way of the sun’s light to the moon.

<li id="fn0113" role="doc-endnote"><p>ok so that’s not really the question, but it like why don’t we have them constantly?

<li id="fn0125" role="doc-endnote"><p>the fact that it isn’t totally in line with the orbit around the sun used to mystify me. Now the fact that it lines up so close to nicely and so nicely with the moon shocks me more<a href="#fn01ref25" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0126" role="doc-endnote"><p>Strictly speaking, the earth’s orbit is not a circle, and so maybe we still would. Then again, the Earth is closest to the sun during northern winter, and I don’t think that the equatorial regions really have any temperature swings, though, again, that’s something I should consider. Ughhhhhh I don’t want to get into the fact that planets have elliptical orbits, but that’s at least something that I should consider for the future video series (which I’ll talk about at the end of this post, because it’s a great idea that a friend had, especially since more and more it looks like that’s where I want my job to end up<a href="#fn01ref26" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<h1 id="universe-in-the-park-part-5"><a href="universe-5.html">Universe in the Park Part 5</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 September 4</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Well, first off, sorry for anyone who tried to read <a href="universe-4">my last post</a>. I apparently completely forgot how to do formatting. I don’t have the spoons<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> to fix it right now, but I will try my hardest to remember to do so in the future.</p>
<p>Unlike my last post, this reflection is only on a single Universe in the Park<a href="#fn022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, rather than five. I think I said this yesterday, but it was not only my final talk of the summer, it was also the final talk of this program for the summer. It had good attendance, for all that the crowd wasn’t as great as I would’ve loved. Most of the first few questions were just polite ways of asking “right, but like, what’s the point?” Thankfully, there were three children there.<a href="#fn023" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> I can always rely on children to ask many and interesting<a href="#fn024" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> questions.</p>
<p>Some highlights from last night include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Do the stars we see at night move?<a href="#fn025" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Are there rocky planets other than the moon?<a href="#fn026" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Two versions of “what color are planets?”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As always, after the formal talk portion of the night, I tried to set up my telescope. It was looking cloudy beforehand, so I did not have any of the prep work done, but I thankfully was able to make quick work of it.<a href="#fn027" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> The moon was large and beautiful<a href="#fn028" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>, so I started pointing at it. Someone told me that Saturn was apparently visible, so I hesitantly pointed the telescope there next.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that Saturn was partially hidden behind a cloud, I think it was the coolest thing I’ve pointed at this summer. The moon is great, but it mostly just looks like a higher definition image of the moon. Most stars just look like brighter dots on the sky. The occasional double is cool, but it’s just two close by dots. Saturn, on the other hand, had resolvable disks!<a href="#fn029" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>After that, I used my trusty star finding app to point me to a nice double given what part of the sky I could see.<a href="#fn0210" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> There was a nice double, and people seemed very<a href="#fn0211" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> excited to see it. After that, there were just a few stragglers, so I showed them Polaris<a href="#fn0212" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> and then not so subtly suggested that they should go home.</p>
<p>It did not feel like a good talk, but I got tons of compliments afterwards. In retrospect, I was in a really bad head space, and while I don’t think it negatively affected my talk too terribly much, I think it absolutely crushed my idea of how well the talk went. It was my tenth of the season and my I think twelfth overall.<a href="#fn0213" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> There are, as it turns out, sixty eight state parks in this state. Given the overlap and the fact that my first talk of the summer wasn’t at a state park<a href="#fn0214" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>, I have slim hopes of making it to all of them for a talk before I leave graduate school. Still, I can try my hardest I suppose.</p>
<p>The park as a whole was pretty beautiful. It was on one of the nice lakes<a href="#fn0215" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>, and it had dunes. I didn’t get in until lateish, and so I didn’t want to go swimming.<a href="#fn0216" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> I then left early in the morning because I had a fairly packed schedule that day.</p>
<p>Anyways, I had a lovely season of these talks, and I’m grateful for the chance to have done them.<a href="#fn0217" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>I made a little progress, in that I learned how to record an animation in blender.</p></li>
<li><p>I did not fight in the least against the entropy in my home.</p></li>
<li><p>I suppose I’m better, in that I did it again today.</p></li>
<li><p>I stretched a little while lifting, but only in so far as a low weight lift is a stretch.</p></li>
<li><p>I went lifting with a friend!</p></li>
<li><p>I did not prioritize sleep. Instead, I went to a friend’s party.</p></li>
<li><p>I woke like three hours earlier than I’d hoped. That is not a positive.</p></li>
<li><p>I am very tired, and so only spent five or so. It was still a great use of time, and I will make sure to do more tomorrow, especially since I can do it on the walk to work instead of on the way home from the gym</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote about four hundred words, which is a little less than I need if I write that much every day. That being said, I also have three days to write that chapter, so.</p></li>
<li><p>I plotted out<a href="#fn0218" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> the rest of the book.</p></li>
<li><p>I did not write poetry.</p></li>
<li><p>I jammed with a friend and shared the new song with him, so sure. I also realized that my installation of Musescore had broken, so I fixed that.</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote five things I like about myself.</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote three things I was excited to have done today.<a href="#fn0219" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I wrote ten things I’m grateful for.</p></li>
<li><p>I did not generally cultivate joy.</p></li>

<h1 id="monthly-reflection"><a href="reflection-august-23.html">Monthly Reflection</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 September 3</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>And, like sand through an hourglass, my own hours have passed silently by. Whoops, that’s a little maudlin. Let’s try opening again.</p>
<p>Like the moon which rises and falls each day, waxing and waning over the course of a month, my own month was filled with intermediate highs and lows.<a href="#fn031" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>August, like a summer’s day, felt so long in the moment and yet so short upon reflection.<a href="#fn032" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> I gave my <a href="universe-4.html">last</a> few<a href="#fn033" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> talks for the summer! I went to a concert!<a href="#fn034" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> I <a href="ms-holmes-ms-watson.hmtl">went to a play!</a></p>
<p>I turned <a href="twenty-five">twenty five</a>! I gave my accordion away to be repaired. I competed in a pinball tournament! I went to a friend’s thesis defense!</p>
<p>I wrote a few letters. I swam in a Great Lake!<a href="#fn035" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> I visited my family!</p>
<p>Ok, so in retrospect, I suppose that I did actually do a lot. It still doesn’t feel like it, but as they<a href="#fn036" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> say, c’est la vie.</p>
<p>Let’s see how that list compares with what I said I was excited for.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>My birthday! Hey nice I did say that.</p></li>
<li><p>Giving five talks in state parks. I at least alluded to this!</p></li>
<li><p>Sharing lemon wine with friends I did! I didn’t think it was notable, though, but I suppose that it was. Once again, generally positive reviews<a href="#fn037" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Finishing my stack of letters. I also had a passive aggressive comment about getting a letter back. I not only finished the stack, I got three!<a href="#fn038" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> letters back.</p></li>
<li><p>Starting to do open mics regularly again I think I did one or two. I don’t know if I’m in an open mic frame of mind anymore. Maybe it will come back to my life again at some point, but it certainly isn’t there now.</p></li>
<li><p>Staying up on all of my book clubs. I dropped one book club, and otherwise I think I did manage to do that.</p></li>
<li><p>Making progress on research. I did! My instrument makes plasma now, and my computational project got approved as a real thing I can devote actual energy to.<a href="#fn039" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Monetizing my story? I did not, though I did just get a review of my book that explicitly asked me to, so I guess that gets to go on this month’s?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at last month’s goals:<a href="#fn0310" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Finish my presentation on the Pleiades. Hey nice! I did it.</p></li>
<li><p>Make my home clean again. I made progress, which is like a success.</p></li>
<li><p>Blog more. Ummm, let me check. I blogged three more times!<a href="#fn0311" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Stretch daily. I stretched seven times. That is much less than daily, especially since I know that at least two of them happened in the same day.</p></li>
<li><p>Sleep enough and have a sleep schedule based around waking up no later than 6. I think I did more of the former and less of the latter. I guess I don’t even know if that’s true, upon thinking. I don’t wake up to alarms, but I don’t feel well rested. Maybe I need more vitamin D.</p></li>
<li><p>Be more intentional about prayer. Oops! This is becoming a perennial goal that I never reach. Maybe this month!</p></li>
<li><p>Get further ahead on the book. In particular, I’d like to set the goal of more than four chapters a week. Well, I did not do that at all. I fell slightly behind, I think, because I was a little ahead at the start of the month and ended exactly at cue. As you might expect from the lack of blogging during a two week period, there was minimal writing of the book going on then.</p></li>
<li><p>Write poetry every day. I wrote some poetry, though not much at all.</p></li>
<li><p>Finish stack of letters, and maybe think of more people to write to? Otherwise, start journaling during my morning time? I finished the stack, though I didn’t think of anyone new, and I did not start writing in a journal. I did use my blog much more as a journal, though, so I suppose that kind of counts, right?</p></li>
<li><p>Write a song. Wow! A goal that I reached with no qualifiers. Not only did I write a whole song, but I even have vocal drafts<a href="#fn0312" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> of a few more songs.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Things that I’m excited for this month:<a href="#fn0313" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Running more than five miles again!<a href="#fn0314" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Swimming with friends!<a href="#fn0315" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Giving my final talk in the parks for the season<a href="#fn0316" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> Coincidentally, this is also the final of the talk series for any speaker.</p></li>
<li><p>Recording a song!</p></li>
<li><p>Being ready for my upcoming talks.</p></li>
<li><p>Maybe<a href="#fn0317" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> give or at least hash out details for me to give my first invited talk at a college I do not attend.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Using last month’s goals, things I am excited about,<a href="#fn0318" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>, and my goals for this year of life as inspiration, this month’s goals:<a href="#fn0319" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Finish/make my talk on the eclipses. I have a lot of ideas, and I need to bang my head against the wall of learning how to animate until that wall breaks or I lose the motivation to do anything.</p></li>
<li><p>Make my home clean again. Listen, if I have the goal long enough, it might set in finally.</p></li>
<li><p>Blog more! I’m off to a terrible start, given that I’m writing this reflection on the third, but.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch and exercise more. I know that it is incredibly important to my mental health that I remain physically active.<a href="#fn0320" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> I also know that I hate how inflexible I am generally, and especially how inflexible I am now.</p></li>
<li><p>As before, sleep enough, and try to prioritize sleeping earlier. I know that my best sleep happens earlier in the night. I might try experimenting with biphasic sleeping<a href="#fn0321" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> since I seem to remember that working for me at some point in my life.</p></li>
<li><p>As always, be more intentional about prayer. Once more off to a bad start, but I really do feel better when I do. I think that spending at least fifteen minutes in the chapel each day<a href="#fn0322" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> is not an unreasonable goal. There isn’t anything that I need to do that I can’t push fifteen minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>Actually get ahead on my book. I would like to be five chapters ahead and to have plotted out the rest of this arc.<a href="#fn0323" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Write more poetry. Daily may not be realistic, especially since I haven’t written much this month.</p></li>
<li><p>Write or record a song. I have the year’s goal of recording an album. If there are twelve songs on my album<a href="#fn0324" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>, I need to record on average a little more than a song a month<a href="#fn0325" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>. I also want to do almost exclusively, if not actually exclusively, originals on my album.<a href="#fn0326" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Write five<a href="#fn0327" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> things I like about myself every day<a href="#fn0328" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>, three things I’m excited for, and ten things I’m grateful for. I keep seeing things about cultivating positivity, and I really need to do that right now.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Given these goals, the questions that I will need to answer each day:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I make progress on my eclipse talk(s)?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I fight against the entropy in my living space?</p></li>
<li><p>Have I been better about blogging?<a href="#fn0329" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I exercise?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I prioritize sleep?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I wake as early as I’d hoped?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I spend fifteen minutes in the chapel?</p></li>
<li><p>Am I writing more than the bare minimum for my book?</p></li>
<li><p>Am I making net progress on plotting my book?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write poetry?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I work on my album?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write five things I like about myself?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write three things I’m excited for?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write ten things I’m grateful for?</p></li>
<li><p>Generally, did I cultivate joy?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>And, as a day in September<a href="#fn0330" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a>, today’s responses:</p>
<ul>

<p>First Published: 2023 August 30</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Last night my family had our first<a href="#fn041" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> board game night. It was a really fun time, for all that it was much shorter than our historic marathon nights. We checked that we were able to play two games,<a href="#fn042" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> and we played through one of them.</p>
<p>Playing Ticket to Ride virtually is a much different experience than playing it live. Thankfully, it is not a game that has significant intrigue, and so the fact that I was playing with the rest of my family from behind a screen didn’t make too much of a difference. It was also really nice to not have to carefully place each of the incredibly small plastic trains on the page. The game layout also makes it incredibly clear how much of the game is left.<a href="#fn043" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>One interesting feature that the game offered is that, like some variations of chess, each player only has so much time to make every choice they will over the course of the game. I chose forty<a href="#fn044" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> five minutes per player, because that was the default for the game, and I didn’t know what changing it would do. I am now curious what would happen if you ran out of time, though. Would it skip your turn? Make you queue your move? I should try it sometime.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>No work on presentations. I might try to spend some time tomorrow or this weekend on it.</p></li>
<li><p>I cleaned even more minimally. I want to try kegging instead of using a secondary for my next batch of lemon wine, though, which means I need to clean soon.</p></li>
<li><p>Writing my blog continues to go well.</p></li>
<li><p>I finished up the next chapter today and plotted out the next chapter. I should really plot out the book a little more than what I’m doing, which is sentences at a time for the future books, five total sentences for this book, and ideas for exactly the next chapter. 2/4+</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote no poetry yesterday. Sadly.</p></li>
<li><p>I posted the letter, which is progress. I did not write, though.</p></li>
<li><p>Maybe stretching was a bad goal.</p></li>
<li><p>Less trouble falling asleep, though I still felt the need to sleep in. Unlike yesterday, I feel very comfortable with that choice.</p></li>
<li><p>I really need to get back into the swing of praying. I haven’t, and I regret it.</p></li>

<h1 id="talk-planning-redux"><a href="talk-planning-redux-1.html">Talk Planning, Redux</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 August 29</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p><a href="talk-planning-1">Last</a> <a href="talk-planning-2">year</a> <a href="talk-planning-3">I</a> gave a talk that was in part about tuning theory. Unsurprisingly, especially given the fact I had been thinking about that talk for years beforehand, I am not entirely happy with the talk that I gave. Mostly, I think that’s because I fell into the same trap that everyone does. Namely: it’s easy to explain how 3 to the n is never equal to 2 to the m<a href="#fn051" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, which means any system is inherently flawed.</p>
<p>As I keep thinking, though, there are other elements I could touch as well. After all, if you only want two notes, you can have a perfectly tuned scale with C and G.<a href="#fn052" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> If you want three notes, then you can even have a well tuned one with C, F, and G.<a href="#fn053" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The first issue, I suppose, comes between using three and five limit tuning. Now, for those who don’t already know,<a href="#fn054" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> limit tuning refers to the largest prime factor you can have in the denominator or numerator. Going through in order:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>One limit tuning: you can play a single note. Arguably, since it’s a single note, it is definitionally in tune</p></li>
<li><p>Two limit tuning: you can play octaves! Wow, harmony!<a href="#fn055" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Three limit tuning: you now get the fifth. Stacking two fifths<a href="#fn056" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> gives you a major second. Stacking three gives you a minor third, and so on until you build the twelve tone scale. Notably, it takes 7 fifths to build a diatonic scale, assuming you start from the correct note.<a href="#fn057" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> That works, but it gives you really wonky thirds, because</p></li>
<li><p>Five limit tuning<a href="#fn058" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>: adds the major and by extension minor third. When building up the ratios, 1 to 2 is an octave, 2 to 3 is a fifth, 3 to 4 is a fourth<a href="#fn059" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>, 4 to 5 is a major third, 5 to 6 is a minor third.<a href="#fn0510" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> The third in 3 limit tuning is<a href="#fn0511" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> 81:64, which is not quite the same. From this, you only need F, C, and G to produce a diatonic scale! Wow, progress</p></li>
<li><p>Seven limit tuning introduces the harmonic seventh. For those who haven’t heard of that, that’s because we don’t really use it in western music.<a href="#fn0512" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Since the harmonic seventh of C lies more or less equidistant between B flat and B,<a href="#fn0513" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> there isn’t much of a use for it, and by extension, any further limit in western tuning.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Ok how did I get here? Right, how tuning theory is broken for multiple reasons. I think that a five limit diatonic scale should work perfectly, assuming you only want to play in one key. I have an inclination that it would break down even as fast as adding the dominant or subdominant keys.<a href="#fn0514" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> Yeah it breaks down immediately.</p>
<p>Ok I know that I’ve done other prep work for the talk, but my notes are all very far away, and getting to them feels like a lot of effort with minimal payoff. Anyways, all this to say, the new talk on tuning theory will go deeper into the math than my last one did, even if I never give it to a single real person.</p>

<li id="fn052" role="doc-endnote"><p>why I always start my scales on C is beyond me. Probably all the accidents relating to white note keys. Eh, it’s not worth being concerned about I suppose<a href="#fn05ref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn053" role="doc-endnote"><p>I’m not totally sure what a minor 7th is supposed to be, but at least the first three notes are fine.<a href="#fn05ref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn055" role="doc-endnote"><p>ok so actually, there’s a concept for consonance and dissonance where it’s how far the notes are harmonically (I mean duh, but my words aren’t working, hence why I’m doing talk planning). The most consonant interval is obviously the octave (since unison isn’t really an interval), and it has a distance of one. A fifth has a distance of two, as does two octaves. I think that matches my experience well, though I need to find the source paper so I can read it (I think I saw it in a 12tone video at some point). From a quick google, it seems like they might be doing log of the least common multiple of the two notes. In that case, once again, there is no way to make a fifth and octaves be the same harmonic distance. At a first order, though, a fifth (2:3) would be six as LCM, and so lies between two and three octaves in terms of dissonance. Ok enough diversion, back to the actual text<a href="#fn05ref5" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn056" role="doc-endnote"><p>for this and everything, assume that I still believe in octave equivalence (for all that I’m more and more intellectually willing to not)<a href="#fn05ref6" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn057" role="doc-endnote"><p>in this case, building from the fourth (fa, or F (hmmmm I wonder if there’s something to the fact that the fourth (f) is fa (f) and the note f (f). eh probably nothing new)<a href="#fn05ref7" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn058" role="doc-endnote"><p>remember, it’s primes, so four adds nothing new<a href="#fn05ref8" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn059" role="doc-endnote"><p>because we define a fifth and a fourth to be an octave, and 2 to four is absolutely an octave<a href="#fn05ref9" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0510" role="doc-endnote"><p>because we define a major and a minor third to be a fifth, and four to six is a fifth<a href="#fn05ref10" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0511" role="doc-endnote"><p>ok some quick math: 3/2 is G, 3/2 times 3/2 is 9/8 (octave equiv) is D, 3/2 more is 27/16 is A, 81/64 is E. 1.265<a href="#fn05ref11" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0512" role="doc-endnote"><p>though there are a lot of arguments that the blues and jazz use it, since they use something known as a blue note, which is halfway between a major and minor third, like this is<a href="#fn05ref12" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0513" role="doc-endnote"><p>968 cents, according to wikipedia (and no, I will not be getting into what a cent is right now, because I don’t care that much)<a href="#fn05ref13" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0514" role="doc-endnote"><p>but I should really work out the math. Let’s see, we get A from F and then A from D if we do dominant. A from D would be 27/16, whereas A from F is 4/3 for F and then the fifth is 4 to 5 so 15/8. Nope, 5/3 actually. That makes more sense. 1.6875 is not quite 1.6 repeating, though they are shockingly close. I suppose that playing the two together could work. I also suppose taking the harmonic (i think that’s the right word, the log based one) average of the two could work<a href="#fn05ref14" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<h1 id="family-book-club"><a href="book-club.html">Family Book Club</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 August 28</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Apparently I’ve never written about my family’s book club.<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> That doesn’t necessarily mean that I haven’t but I can’t find it, so it doesn’t count right now.</p>
<p>So, what is the family book club?<a href="#fn062" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Well, you need to come with me back to the far off time of 2018?<a href="#fn063" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> My father messaged one of our family group chats<a href="#fn064" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> about a book he thought we should all read.<a href="#fn065" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> I<a href="#fn066" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> then replied that we should have a family book club. The rest of my family agreed, and so we have all taken turns<a href="#fn067" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> choosing a book for us all to read.</p>
<p>Each book club begins with a few standard questions.<a href="#fn068" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>We all give a thumbs up, down, or to the side for whether we enjoyed the book or not. The one who chose the book says why they picked it. We all give our big picture opinions on the book.</p>
<p>Then, because we exclusively read digitally, we go through the ebook that we have all annotated<a href="#fn069" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> and read through each comment and highlight. We usually have pizza while we do our club, though that is not mandatory. Reading through all the comments almost always takes far longer than the pizza does to be consumed, and it often ends in a bit of a drag.</p>
<p>In total, we’ve read twenty five books for book club.<a href="#fn0610" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Ten of them have been what I would classify as self help books, which is kind of fun, I suppose. Since we’ve now gone through 25 in about five years, I suppose we do each really have an average of a single book per person per year, wow.

<h1 id="ms.-holmes-and-ms.-watson-review"><a href="ms-holmes-ms-watson.html">Ms. Holmes and Ms. Watson Review</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 August 24</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>A few weeks ago now<a href="#fn071" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I did something that I haven’t done in a while.<a href="#fn072" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> I went to go see a play. The university I attend<a href="#fn073" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> was putting on a production of Ms. Holmes and Ms. Watson.</p>
<p>Now, if you’re anything like me, then your first instinct will be to complain that it’s “Ms.” Watson, not “Dr.” Watson.<a href="#fn074" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> I had that complaint going in, especially since the play was described as a feminist retelling.<a href="#fn075" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> I had<a href="#fn076" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> recently subscribed to a SubStack<a href="#fn077" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> called “Letters from Watson,” which just sends out serialized versions of the Sherlock Holmes short stories. It’s really interesting reading them, especially as someone who reads<a href="#fn078" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> a fair amount of modern serialized fiction. The genre conventions have certainly shifted in the intervening years. However, since this post is a review of the show, rather than the fiction, I digress.</p>
<p>When I arrived, the play promised many of the common staples of modern small work plays. It said that there would be forced audience participation<a href="#fn079" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> and that it was a loving but disrespectful<a href="#fn0710" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> retelling of Arthur Conan Doyle’s work. It was fine.</p>
<p>I’m not sure whether I was just hungry and so not as into the play as normal, but the play lacked a lot of flow to me. When I go to a play that I really enjoy, at least for a moment I forget that what I am watching is a play. At no point during the show did I forget that I was sitting in a crowd, watching a performance. I suppose the fourth wall breaks did add to that feeling.<a href="#fn0711" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Still, it was an enjoyable show, and I would happily see it again.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>One of my research group mates is also planning to learn how to use Blender, so now I have an accountability buddy for it. I also think it might be worth finding some set of online tutorials and starting them sooner than later.</p></li>
<li><p>It is beyond hot, which meant that I have been trying to minimize moving as much as possible.</p>
<p>As a direct result, that means that I was not making those big strides.</p></li>
<li><p>I’m now four for four<a href="#fn0712" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> posts, for all that I did not remember to post the actual post from yesterday until this morning. I suppose that there’s not much of a way for future readers to see that, though if you were on the post last night, I apologize.</p></li>
<li><p>As a direct result of thinking about math and coding for my entire day yesterday, I did not write too much. According to my logs, I wrote a little under four hundred words of Jeb today. I need to write more, since I’m currently typing tomorrow’s chapter. I’m not sure where I’m trying to go with the story at this exact moment, which I think is part of the issue. My nominal plans for the book say that the next 85 chapters will cover a few<a href="#fn0713" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> amount of years in the character’s life. I suppose that sitting and blocking out what I want to happen could be a good idea.</p>
<p>2.3/4+</p></li>
<li><p>Last night I left my laptop at work. Probably as a direct result, I wrote an entire song!<a href="#fn0714" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I did not journal. That’s probably fine.</p></li>
<li><p>I forgot to stretch this morning. Or, equally fairly, it was very hot and I wanted to not do anything.</p></li>
<li><p>I fell asleep at a normal time last night, which was nice. I also woke up before my goal of 6 am today, which was absolutely fantastic.</p></li>
<li><p>I prayed a rosary last night before bed and then listened along to a rosary podcast that a friend recommended on my commute to work today.</p></li>

<h1 id="for-twenty-five"><a href="twenty-five.html">25 for Twenty Five</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 August 23</p>
<h1 id="draft-2-13-september-2023">Draft 2: 13 September 2023</h1>
<p>Whoops! The first draft of this posting didn’t have proper formatting.<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> So, in addition to adding things, I’m going to have the second draft actually be, you know, formatted. Also, I’m going to delete some of the text, since it’s really rambly.</p>
<p><a href="twenty-four.html">last year</a> I tried to do twenty four things between my twenty fourth and twenty fifth birthday. I had hoped that setting that goal would have two major effects on my life. First, I had hoped that it would make me more intentional about what I spend my time on. After all, even though I do not know what the number is, I do know that I only have a finite amount of time on this earth. While that has never meant<a href="#fn082" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> maximizing the utility of every single fleeting moment, I do find that I prefer to look back on my time when I have been more intentional with it, rather than less.</p>
<p>The second goal, obviously, was to encourage me to try new things. I don’t know how successful, if at all, that goal was. After all, as I have been told many times by far too many people, I am generally a person who is open to trying new things. That’s certainly something I strive to be, at least. That being said, I was at least more aware of things I had done for the first time, at least in my<a href="#fn083" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> memory.</p>
<p>So, since I enjoyed the challenge, I decided that I’d try it again. n for n is now being rebranded as my attempt to do more new things each passing calendar year. Since there are an infinite number of activities I can try, that should remain doable, especially if I start lowering my standards.</p>
<p>This post also feels like a good place to reflect on the first quarter century of my life. There are arguments to be made that nothing before I have concrete memory should really count, which I have mixed feelings about, and so will ignore. I’ve gotten a Master’s<a href="#fn084" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Degree, graduated a college with a double major, and earned my Eagle Scout. Those seem like sort of the big three in terms of explicit and externally validated life accomplishments, but there are far more things that I’ve done. I have received five of seven sacraments, which I’m beyond grateful for. I’ve also grown a lot, both physically and mentally. Most importantly, while I don’t think that any age<a href="#fn085" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> of previous me would have foreseen me being where I am right now, I also don’t think any of the past mes would be unhappy with it. I am grateful for the time I have had and look forward to the time to come. My fingers are crossed that I will get more than another quarter century on this earth, and I hope to use it well. Maudlin musing aside, there are some things that I want to do in this year. I think that updates for this post will be coming in two forms: things that I have done, and things that I want to do. There were things I wanted to do last year that I kept forgetting about, and so never did.<a href="#fn086" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> With that in mind: Things that I want to do before my quarter century year is gone:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Learn how to weave. I don’t really care if that’s card weaving, tablet weaving,<a href="#fn087" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> floor loom, rigid handle, tapestry weaving, or rug. What’s important to me is that I make the time to make at least a single woven object. Truthfully, getting back into basket weaving would even be good enough for me.</p></li>
<li><p>Take an improv class. It seems fun, and that’s an activity that will be important to me going forward.</p></li>
<li><p>I’d like to learn a polka on the accordion. It seems like the music most associated with the instrument, at least to most, and it’s something that a lot of people I know like.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to record an album. It doesn’t need to be anything incredible, but I want to be able to point to a collection of songs and music<a href="#fn088" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> that I have made and that others can view and access.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to get back into book binding.<a href="#fn089" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> I have bound in my life, a single book. It was the sketch book we were required to use in the introductory art class I took. I remember loving the book, and equally importantly, loving the process of making it.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to finally learn how to spin yarn. A good friend gifted me with a starting set last year for my birthday, and I never got around to it.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to be able to swim a continuous mile. I don’t know if I ever have been able to before, and it seems like the sort of thing that I would like to be able to do.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Huh, I hadn’t realized some of the things I wanted to do. I don’t know if I’ve ever articulated, to myself, at least, a desire to record an album. Apparently all those people who say that giving yourself space is good are true. Anyways, I have also done new things since turning twenty five!</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I <a href="pinball.html">competed in a pinball league!</a><a href="#fn0810" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I swam in Lake Superior!<a href="#fn0811" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I served jury duty!<a href="#fn0812" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>

<li><p>I went to a baby shower. I’m sure I’ve been to one sometime before, but I have no recollection of having done so.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>That puts me at a full fifth of the needed new activities, which is nice, especially since I haven’t gone through a full new month. Anyways, I hope to keep both of these lists updated, and hopefully I’ll be able to start moving things from the want to do list to the have done list. I have an awesome set of amazing friends, and I’m beyond grateful that they also do many fantastic things. Relevant to this post, one friend wants to do a good number of the things I want to do as well, which will be nice.</p>
<p>Since this posting is happening the same day that I’m also writing a full blog post, I’ll do my daily reflection there instead.</p>

<h1 id="pinball-part-one"><a href="pinball.html">Pinball Part One</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 August 22</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Last Wednesday I competed in my first ever pinball tournament. I had no clue what it would be like going into it, which may not have been my best choice ever. Nonetheless, I knew a few important facts. ?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Signups were at six pm</p></li>
<li><p>Play started at half six<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>It was sponsored by a local craft brewery</p></li>
<li><p>There was a group play and a finals portion of the night?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As I told my friends going into it, my only real goal in the competition was making it past group play. As it turns out, that was a needlessly pessimistic goal. Everyone makes it into the finals, though not in the same bracket. ? I suppose I should explain the format of the competition. After signups, everyone is<a href="#fn092" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> randomly assigned to a group of four.<a href="#fn093" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Each group plays seven of the eight machines at the bar<a href="#fn094" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>, and they record their scores at the end of each three ball set.<a href="#fn095" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> They had a few extra rules, like that you weren’t allowed to play extra balls, which makes complete sense to me in retrospect. While it would not have made a huge difference for me, there were people whose every ball lasted at least five minutes. ? In my group of four, there was me,<a href="#fn096" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> the person who ended up winning the entire competition that night, the girlfriend of the brewery’s rep<a href="#fn097" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>, and a fourth person about as good as I was. Once group play ended, we all turned our slips of paper in to someone, who then ranked us best to worst. One rankings were done, I found out how finals work. When I had signed up, the organizer told me that they make sure it’s not just the absolute best players who get a prize, because that would discourage less good players from attending. ? So, we are all ranked from best to worst. The best four players go to a machine and play single elimination games until there is one person left.<a href="#fn098" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Now, you may be wondering how they pick which machine they go on. The top seed in each set gets to choose their machine.<a href="#fn099" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> I was the top seed of the fourth bracket<a href="#fn0910" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>, which was where they started putting us in groups of three.<a href="#fn0911" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> I chose Godzilla, because it was the most fun machine. At that point, I was incredibly nervous. One of the other people on my machine was the fourth player in my qualifier, who was notably better than me at the Godzilla machine. ?But, I managed to squeak out a win twice, and that meant that I got a prize.?I ended up taking home a four pack of craft beer.<a href="#fn0912" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>?I also took home a tshirt and some stickers, which was nice. I also learned while there that the brewery buys your first<a href="#fn0913" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> beer of the night. ?It was really fun, for all that it lasted much longer than I expected it to. I had really thought that the entire event would be over in two or three hours.?Instead, it took four, and that was apparently a quick tournament as far as their timings go.?I’ll probably do it again, though I’ll make sure to eat dinner first and know that I’ll be late rising the next day. ?</p>

<li><p>I need to start working on the eclipse talk again. I have some notes from friends who have made them in the past, which should be helpful in making the presentation, as soon as I start to look at them. Truthfully, I’m not entirely sure what the layout of my talk is going to be. Right now, I’m leaning towards building the solar system up from the sun, then the sun and earth, then adding the moon, then adding locks, etc. I don’t know if that’s the best idea, but it’s resonated with me for a week, which is generally a good sign. I should really blog about it sometime.</p></li>
<li><p>I think I made a slight bit of progress against entropy last night, though that was as minimal as it could get. Hopefully I have a little more energy tonight.</p></li>
<li><p>Blogged yesterday! And today! Wow look at me the best</p></li>
<li><p>I’m writing this post first thing in the morning, so no new book content. 1/4+</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote some iambic pentameter last night<a href="#fn0914" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> and a little more today<a href="#fn0915" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>. Maybe that’s a better thing for me to do right now than a whole sonnet. I know that’s an excuse, but any poetry is probably better than no poetry, and I’m mentally exhausted lately.</p></li>
<li><p>I did not journal today, though I meant to. I got a letter from a friend yesterday and a package from a different friend a few days ago. Both of those probably deserve and need responses.</p></li>
<li><p>I stretched last night and this morning, focusing on my hips and shoulders.<a href="#fn0916" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> I also ran on a treadmill yesterday and then swam.<a href="#fn0917" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I went to bed incredibly early last night, which meant I fell asleep somewhat early.</p></li>
<li><p>I should really pray rosaries more. That’s something I need to get back into.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once again, sorry for the rambling nature of the posting. That’s what the site encourages.? ?</p>
