<p>Last night went well! I ended up doing my two original songs and Stan Roger‚Äôs ‚ÄúMaid on the Shore,‚Äù because it‚Äôs a little bit spooky, which is good Halloween vibes. I had another person comment that the song seemed incredibly sad, and that I seemed sad while performing it, which is fun. It‚Äôs especially fun because they then commented on how not sad I seem otherwise.</p>
<p>I ended up staying later than normal, and played another set. That one was significantly less prepared, so I did two more Stan Rogers songs that I kind of know. It could have gone better but, that‚Äôs the way the cookie crumbles. I realize I never actually figured out how to end them in playing, so it was awkward.</p>

<p>Luke 19:6 ‚ÄúAnd he came down quickly and received him with joy.‚Äù</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>I appreciate how last week we heard about the tax collector who knew he was a sinful man, and this week we hear about Zacchaeus, a tax collector, who is called to the faith. Something that stuck out to me in particular is his line ‚Äúif I have extorted anything from anyone I shall repay it four times over.‚Äù In the homily I listened to, the priest mentioned that he absolutely extorted, which is likely where the other half of his wealth would go.</p>
<p>I, on the other hand, took Zacchaeus at his word. One recurring message these past weeks is the contrast between perceived holiness and actual holiness. ‚ÄúOf course Zacchaeus extorted‚Äù, we and the people at the time would say. And yet, what if he didn‚Äôt?</p>
<p>Too often I find myself judging, making wild extrapolations from minimal data. To me, at least, yesterday‚Äôs Gospel called us to reflect on why we assume the worst from those who we barely know.</p>

<p>First Published: 2022 October 28</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Way back <a href="nanowrimo.tex">in the initial iteration of this blog</a>, I attempted the National Novel Writer‚Äôs Month (NaNoWriMo). I think<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> that I mostly just tried to hit the wordcount<a href="#fn022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> in these blog posts. My logic then was that I had far more free time, as I was lacking the obligations of ‚Äúsport, ensembles, (most of) my instruments, much of the studying, a job, etc‚Äù, and so should be able to do it. Today much of that is true as well, and I would really like to see if I can write a novel in a month.</p>
<p>Of course, it‚Äôs not going to be good, but I‚Äôve started actively scheduling time in my day to write<a href="#fn023" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, and it‚Äôs worked well for creating ideas. I also really have a lot of ideas I want to read, and the only realistic way that will happen is if I become the writer for them. Back then I was apparently writing around 750 words a day, which is far more than my posts lately<a href="#fn024" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. But, having now written a book<a href="#fn025" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>, I feel more able to write a long<a href="#fn026" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>-form piece of creative prose.</p>

<p>First Published: 2022 October 27</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>I find that my life runs better when it‚Äôs more heavily scheduled. Often, this means that I have activities planned for particular times, but it‚Äôs more than that. Lately I‚Äôve been running into a fair number of friends who I realize I‚Äôve lost contact with in the past few months, not through any malice on either of our ends, but simply because it‚Äôs easy to forget people in graduate school.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt want to forget the people who mean a lot to me, so I need to figure out a way to get into the habit of messaging people I care about. I was recently having a conversation with someone where I mentioned that I‚Äôve been called really considerate before because I had written down a reminder, and then remembered the event from it. I don‚Äôt think of that as particularly speaking to my care/memory, because it was just me sending a note into the aether, where it eventually came back to me. The person I was talking to is in the camp of extended memory as memory<a href="#fn031" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, and so assured me that not having the memory to remember important things wasn‚Äôt important, especially since I had a system to figure it out.</p>
<p>Still, though, I know that I have systems which work. I really just need to use them. Maybe I should just set a reminder to text people every few weeks.</p>

<h1 id="on-celtic-knots"><a href="celtic-knots.html">On Celtic Knots</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 October 26</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As I‚Äôve mentioned <a href="celtic-crochet.html">before</a>, I like crocheting Celtic knots. I also like drawing them. One issue I often have with them, though, is that extant knotwork often has motifs other than just an interwoven strand.</p>
<p>A very common motif is some sort of animal shape, which I‚Äôve always struggled to draw. So, recently I decided it would be fun to learn how to draw a dragon,<a href="#fn041" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> so that I could make better<a href="#fn042" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> knotwork.</p>
<p>It went really slowly at first. Every dragon I drew looked somewhat goofy, which I only realized later was because of a lack of details.<a href="#fn043" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Eventually I figured out how to draw nice<a href="#fn044" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> dragon heads, and even made a convincing knot or two with them. Then I decided to learn to draw wings, for some reason.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve always struggled with wings, probably because of the inherent need for a 3D perspective. For whatever reason, though, this time I drew good enough wings within like 15 minutes of trying, which is fun. Anyways, I‚Äôm enjoying the Celtic knot resurgence in my life.</p>

<h1 id="on-bagpipes"><a href="bagpipes.tex">On Bagpipes</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 October 24</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Yesterday I got to play bagpipes at a friend‚Äôs wedding. It was a lovely service, and I‚Äôm grateful that I got to take part in it.</p>
<p>While I was setting up, I remembered the last service I saw bagpipes at. I was at a funeral for a friend‚Äôs family member. It was there that I thought about how fitting bagpipes are for emotional performances.</p>
<p>Unlike most any other instrument, which requires consistent and continuous breath support, in the bagpipes you blow just the top of your breath each time. When your breathing turns to gasps, you can<a href="#fn051" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> still play pipes.</p>
<p>Anyways, yesterday‚Äôs occasion was really happy and joyful. It‚Äôs always shocking to me how much people really appreciate hearing music, especially from instruments that they don‚Äôt hear often. Most of the parents and assorted older members of the wedding came up to express their gratitude for my playing, and the bride and groom both were happy for ti. It‚Äôs nice when my hobbies actually get to be helpful.</p>

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>I really love today‚Äôs Gospel, because it gets directly to the heart of the Christian call to holiness. We are not saved through our own actions. We are not holy through our own merits. Rather, we are called to remember that we are sinners, and the good in our life comes from He who is Good.</p>
<p>St. Paul reminds us that we are strong enough to do what He calls us to do, because we are given the strength we need. The First Reading reminds us that there is no one the Lord does not hear.</p>

<h1 id="book-review-of-gideon-the-ninth"><a href="book-review-gideon-ninth.html">Book Review of Gideon the Ninth</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 October 21</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>I‚Äôm still figuring out how to do these book reviews. I think maybe a good, bad, other style could be good? I haven‚Äôt done that here, but there‚Äôs always next time.</p>
<p>In addition to reading <a href="book-review-atomic-habits.html"><em>Atomic Habits</em></a> yesterday, I also finished a book that I was reading with a friend.<a href="#fn071" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> That book was Tamsyn Muir‚Äôs <em>Gideon the Ninth.</em></p>
<p>I‚Äôd heard a lot of praise for the book from different people unprompted, so I was curious how reading it would go. Overall, I enjoyed the book a lot, for all that I still have no idea what happened. The book begins, not so much <em>in media res</em> as <em>in medium mundum</em>. Our main character is trying to escape captivity. She has dreams of joining the military, if only to get off of the planet she‚Äôs on.</p>
<p>Very quickly, we learn that this universe is one of necromancy and inter-planetary travel. Gideon (our intrepid hero) is not a necromancer. The only other girl on the planet<a href="#fn072" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, is, however. The two fight about whether or not Gideon should be allowed to leave the planet, and it ends up in a duel.</p>
<p>Shockingly, the girl with a sword cannot beat the girl with a seemingly infinite number of skeletons in combat. For losing, Gideon is forced to attend a meeting, where they learn that their God Emperor wants new immortal killing machines. Both think this sounds like a great idea,<a href="#fn073" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, and they fly off to a planet to meet the other houses.</p>
<p>From there, there‚Äôs intrigue, romance, and violence. Becoming an immortal necromancer stops seeming quite as wholly good and starts to seem more morally grey as the book continues.<a href="#fn074" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> All in all, it‚Äôs an enjoyable read, with a couple of caveats.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs a trend I‚Äôve noticed as I‚Äôve started reading more and more self-published/first works.<a href="#fn075" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Either the text contains literal paragraphs of explanatory text <em>a la</em> ‚ÄúA gronkle is the currency in the realm. It is worth twenty two shenks, which are approximately one inch in diameter. One shenk is worth about as much as a single mana crystal, which is powerful enough to cast one fireball from. Unlike the gronkle-shenk relationship, which is enforced by the King (btw we‚Äôre in a total monarchy)...‚Äù, or there‚Äôs a glossary/index that we‚Äôre supposed to refer to while reading. Gideon is the latter half, at least for me.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll take some responsibility in this. I often struggle to keep characters apart in books, but the author does just go ‚Äúhere‚Äôs sixteen new characters. Anyways, from now on I‚Äôll be referring to them by name and where they come from interchangeably.‚Äù However, the experience was still really enjoyable. I‚Äôm excited to start the next book in the series.</p>

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>By recommendation,<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I listened to James Clear‚Äôs <em>Atomic Habits</em> today on a long drive.<a href="#fn082" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> It‚Äôs a book which uses anecdote and scientific evidence to help build the habits we want in our life. Like every other self-help book I read by pseudo-scientific men who started out blogging,<a href="#fn083" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> it uses the example of compounding interest, and how small percent differences become massive over time. Unlike others, he really emphasizes how you‚Äôre completely unlikely to see any of the gains until after you‚Äôve fully established a habit, which is nice.</p>
<p>Another good part of the book is that he makes a point of the fact that habits don‚Äôt form out of nowhere. Whether it‚Äôs a net good for our overall life or not, any habit we start is started, on some level, at least, because it‚Äôs improving our immediate environment.</p>
<p>The advice seems good and practical, which is somewhat uncommon in these sorts of books. There‚Äôs also good mention of survivorship bias, which is often lacking in the genre. Overall, it‚Äôs a really enjoyable read, and doesn‚Äôt suffer from the same page-length padding common to the genre. It‚Äôs a quick read that I‚Äôd recommend!</p>
