<p>Assuming <a href="open-mic-6.html">my last post about open mics</a> was the last time I went to one,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I haven’t been in about two months. I’m glad that it’s been long enough that the staple songs I mentioned no longer feel stale. In particular, Maid on the Shore was everyone I polled’s favorite song.</p>
<p>I had planned on it being like most open mics I’ve gone to at the bar, where I have ten minutes, though finishing early is encouraged. Instead, I had fifteen and a generous fifteen at that. It was fun!</p>
<p>I played two original songs.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> I then played Three Fishers, because I love the picking pattern. After that, I made a joke about having time and played The Rose.</p>
<p>By that point I really thought I should be done. I wasn’t which meant I had to start thinking of songs I just know on a deep level. Maid on the Shore is one of those, so I played it.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Even still I had time! So I finished with 45 Years, which was a little low for me where I set my capo. C’est la vie, live and learn.</p>
<p>I’m very excited to go back next week. I had initially planned to play accordion, but my accordion is out of tune sadly. So, assuming I don’t figure out how to fix it yesterday, it looks like another week of guitar. I suppose I should start thinking of a setlist.</p>
<p>Maid on the Shore deserves an encore, I think at least. I’ve only ever done Treaty<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> on accordion, but I think it could work on guitar. If not, You Want it Darker maybe? What did the Deep Sea Say is a song my band did, so that could be fun. I Will Follow You Into the Dark is another option, though I’d need to be better at the chords for it. Til Forever Falls Apart also maybe belongs.</p>
<p>My two originals should probably get some more love/playtime too.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I did minimal work on presentations, though I did finish one that’s due Friday.</p></li>
<li><p>I made progress against entropy! It is nice being able to see more of my floor.</p></li>
<li><p>I blogged yesterday and today! wow a streak</p></li>
<li><p>I finished the chapter of Jeb! I’m also starting another. Total this week: 1.4/4+?</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote a poem yesterday and am going to write another after this post.</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote and posted a letter!</p></li>
<li><p>I did not work on my song, though I meant to.</p></li>
<li><p>I stretched this morning!</p></li>
<li><p>I am out too late again, though it was a friend’s birthday, so I feel less than bad about it.</p></li>
<li><p>I did a rosary in the chapel this morning! It was hard to stay focused, but easier than historically, which is nice.</p></li>
