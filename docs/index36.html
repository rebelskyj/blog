<p>Diaries today are becoming more and more of a digital phenomenon. That is, people are deciding to record their thoughts on computers, rather than paper. This transition from analog to digital is not wholly uncontroversial.</p>

The fact that two different agencies,<a href="#fn0018" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> both make constant backups of the Internet is seen as a lackluster response.

<p>Diaries today are becoming more of a digital phenomenon. That is, more and more people decide to record their thoughts on digital displays, rather than analog records. However, this transition from analog to digital is not wholly uncontroversial.</p>
<p>Many people have a distrust of digital diary keeping. But, examination of these objections tends to show that they are rooted in either classism or appeals to tradition. They almost always find themselves orienting around the alleged fragility of digital diaries.<a href="#fn0021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>And, for those unfamiliar with the Internet, online storage can seem horribly fragile. Unlike a bound book, which can last indefinitely, digital diaries require constant upkeep. If written in a word processor a blog<a href="#fn0022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> post could plausibly become unreadable if the file format becomes obsolete or unused. But, most blogs are, as the name suggests, hosted on the Internet.</p>
<p>A second concern is that posts on the web may be pulled down or somehow also become unavailable. The fact that the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine<a href="#fn0023" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> or Google’s own caching system both make constant backups is seen as lackluster.

<p>Diaries, like many written records, are becoming more and more of a digital phenomenon. That is, more and more people decide to record their thoughts on digital displays, rather than analog records. And, like the other forms becoming digital, the transition from analog to digital is not wholly uncontroversial.</p>
<p>For many reasons, people have a distrust of digital diary keeping. But, even a mild examination of most of these objections shows that they are deeply rooted in either classist thoughts or appeals to tradition. They almost always find themselves orienting around the alleged fragility of digital diaries, regardless of the factuality of these claims.<a href="#fn0026" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with the Internet, online storage can seem horribly fragile. Unlike a bound book, which can last indefinitely, digital diaries require constant upkeep. If written in a word processor, for instance, a blog<a href="#fn0027" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> post could plausibly become unreadable if the file format becomes obsolete or unused. However, since nearly old computers are still functional, and old operating systems are constantly being ported to new machines, it is unlikely that we will ever have files that we truly cannot open. They may be difficult to interpret, but no more so than damaged manuscripts.</p>
<p>A second concern is that posts on the web may be pulled down or somehow also become unavailable. The obvious rebuttal to this statement, namely the Internet Archive<a href="#fn0028" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> or Google’s own caching system is seen as lackluster. O’Sullivan complains that “the Wayback Machine (the Internet Archive) does not have word or subject search capabilities.”footnote<span>Diaries, On-Line Diaries, and the Future Loss to Archives; Or, Blogs and the Blogging Bloggers who Blog Them. C. O’Sullivan p.71</span> That argument would hold merit if not for the fact that physical diaries lack search capabilities, and libraries holding them do as well. What searching methods are available come only when dedicated people add them.</p>
<p>However, the lack of searching capabilities is never seen as a flaw in traditional diaries. Unlike physical diaries, anyone can access any blog from anywhere and anytime, which frees the researcher from needing the funds to go to the specific library where a diary is held, or find a way to have a copy made. They can also search, since every modern web browser has search and find capabilities.</p>
<p>Additionally, since these files are spread over many different servers, it is far less likely that we will undergo a similar loss to the burning of the Library of Alexandria or even the very recent burning of the linguistic library in Brazil.<a href="#fn0029" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> Had the files in the library been digital, they could have been more easily duplicated, and would have been hosted in a different site from the physical artifacts, preventing that horrible loss of knowledge.</p>
<p>That tragedy leads to the third problem with preferring physical media over digital media. Yes, you can duplicate a physical document. If you don’t care about the exactness of the replicated document, it is a fairly trivial process to transcribe a backup. But, as the recent burning of the Brazilian library shows, even vitally important documents aren’t always backed up. What guarantee does a random, insignificant citizen of the world have that anything they write will ever be relevant to historians?</p>
<p>The most honest answer is that they don’t. Most likely nothing any given blogger has to say won’t be relevant. Nonetheless, the Internet protects and safeguards it. Yes, it is true that we may not have a guarantee that this generation’s Beowulf will survive if not printed. However, even many of the manuscripts from that time are still gone. The Internet makes it more likely that the unimportant words will live on.</p>
<p>And to me, that truly is the heart of digital diary keeping, and by extension, the internet. They doesn’t promise permanence, only equality. Every work hosted on Wordpress, for instance, is just as likely to be there in fifty year’s time.<a href="#fn0030" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> The famous and forgotten will both exist in perpetuity.

<p>Diaries, like many written records, are becoming more and more of a digital phenomenon. And, like these other records, the transition is not wholly uncontroversial.

If written in a word processor, for instance,<a href="#fn0055" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref55" role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a> the blog post may can hypothetically become unreadable if the file format becomes obsolete or unused.

And that, along with the different archiving methods, brings to the next point. This is the first time in human history where we can not only see what was written, but pinpoint to the exact second when a piece is written, edited, or deleted. Diary studiers point to the spread of the clock as a phenomenon leading to the rise of the diary and see this as a good change, and yet don’t feel the same way about the rise of digital media. To me, this is, especially 15 years after the publishing of O’Sullivan’s article, nothing except baseless fear of the future.</p>

It is far less likely that we will undergo a similar loss to the burning of the Library of Alexandria<a href="#fn0072" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref72" role="doc-noteref"><sup>72</sup></a> or even the very recent burning of the linguistic library in South America.<a href="#fn0073" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref73" role="doc-noteref"><sup>73</sup></a> Had the files been wholly digital, they could have been more easily duplicated, and would have been likely hosted in a different site from the physical artifacts.</p>
<p>That leads to the third problem with physical over digital media. Yes, you can duplicate a physical document. But, as the recent burning of the library shows, even drastically important documents aren’t always backed up. What guarantee does a random, insignificant citizen of the world have that anything they write will ever be relevant to historians? Even if it isn’t, the internet protects and safeguards it. Yes, we may not have as good of a guarantee of this generation’s Beowulf surviving on parchment. But, we have a much higher chance that the random thoughts of a random individual will be as accessible to future generations as that epic.</p>
<p>That truly is the heart of the internet. It doesn’t promise permanence, it promises equality. Every work hosted on wordpress is just as likely to be there in fifty year’s time.<a href="#fn0074" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref74" role="doc-noteref"><sup>74</sup></a> And that, along with the different archiving methods, brings to the next point. This is the first time in human history where we can not only see what was written, but pinpoint to the exact second when a piece is written, edited, or deleted. We no longer can question which draft of a manuscript is older.</p>

<h1 id="othello-review"><a href="othello.html">Othello Review</a></h1>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Tonight I had the pleasure of watching Othello at the Globe Theatre. In a wonderful turn of events, I was a groundling.<a href="#fn011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I was right next to the stage, and even leaning on it for the piece of the play after intermission.</p>
<p>Sadly, the set and lighting didn’t blow me away. The lights were fixed and immobile, and the set more or less was as well. What I can comment on, however, was the music.</p>
<p>The show began with natural trumpets,<a href="#fn012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> which was nice. Come the scene where Cassio becomes drunk, they are replaced with valved trumpets. Before the first intermission, they bring out the cornetti,</p>
<p>In the second act, the cornetti play lamentations as the piece falls to its tragic fate. The ending dance, however, returns with the beautiful jazz trumpeting. Other instruments included a lute during the drunk scene, played masterfully by Iago, drums and other percussion played by instrumentalists, and whistles.</p>
<p>Finally, as is requested by Shakespeare, there is singing. The drunken songs sounded drunk and merry. The whole cast song at the end was sung brilliantly.<a href="#fn013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> But, the song that struck me hardest was Desdemona and Emilia’s duet of the Willow Tree. They flowed between two part harmony and unisons flawlessly and beautifully. I stood entranced for the first<a href="#fn014" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> time in the show. Nothing existed for me except the two flowing voices and the story they told.</p>
<p>And truly, that’s all that I can ask of a show. There was a moment where time stood still, and I found myself drawn, not into the story or characters, but simply into a place where I feel what the characters feel. Even in professional theatre, those moments can be hard to come by, but the cast brought me nearly to that point time and time again, and to the point in the soulful duet. But, as all good things do,<a href="#fn015" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> it too came to an end.</p>

<h1 id="todays-gospel"><a href="todays-gospel.html">Today’s Gospel</a></h1>
<h1 id="draft-3">Draft 3</h1>
<p>Today’s Gospel<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> reading features one of the two lines that I find most striking in the Gospels.<a href="#fn022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Jesus exhorts Peter, “Get behind me, Satan!”<a href="#fn023" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Peter, the man who<a href="#fn024" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Jesus loved and trusted so much so that he entrusted the Church to him, is called Satan.<a href="#fn025" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> To me, this truly shows two of the important pieces of my Catholic faith: we are to act and speak as we see true, not always meekly or gently, and that we are to love the sinner and hate the sin. Jesus doesn’t reproach Peter in soft words, or calmly. In fact, he doesn’t even do it kindly. In no uncertain words, he tells Peter that he is sinning.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, 6 days later, he takes Peter to the mountain where he meets with Elijah and Moses.<a href="#fn026" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Even though the Gospels don’t mention it, clearly Jesus forgave Peter for his actions, and Peter tried to accept this change.</p>
<p>This reading particularly speaks to me in today’s climate. We tend to take neither of the two messages we are told to take. We don’t tell the people we love to their faces that what they are doing is wrong.<a href="#fn027" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> We also don’t do the other side of the message, and forgive those who do wrong. I’m as guilty of this as anyone. I judge quickly and quietly, then discount anything that someone who has spoken out of ignorance has to say. Today’s reading was a good reminder to me that I need to try harder to love, even when it’s hard.</p>

<p>Today’s Gospel<a href="#fn028" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> reading features one of the two lines that I find most striking in the Gospels.<a href="#fn029" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Jesus exhorts Peter, “Get behind me, Satan!”<a href="#fn0210" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

Jesus doesn’t reproach Peter in soft words, or calmly.

This is truly the best example of Jesus saying that we are to love the sinner, even if we abhor the sin. Moreso, it points out to me that we have the responsibility to help those around us who make mistakes. 6 days later, he takes Peter to the mountain where he meets with Elijah and Moses.<a href="#fn0216" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> Even though the Gospels don’t mention it, clearly there was some conversation during those 6 days where the misunderstanding was resolved.</p>

<h1 id="sleep-days"><a href="sleepy-days.html">Sleep Days</a></h1>
<p>Some days you go to sleep, anxiously awaiting the coming morning and day. Other days you wake up, counting down the moments until you can go back to sleep.</p>
<p>There are many factors that can influence both of those, from what’s happening in your life at a macro scale,<a href="#fn031" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> at a micro scale,<a href="#fn032" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, and how much sleep you’ve gotten the night<a href="#fn033" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> before.</p>
<p>Today I remembered that sleep you miss is at least as important as the other two. I didn’t sleep enough, and so today wasn’t as fully experienced as it could be. I’m hoping tomorrow will be better.</p>

<h1 id="playing-the-ukulele"><a href="playing-the-ukulele.html">Playing the Ukulele</a></h1>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As you many have gathered from my <a href="http://j.rebelsky.com/pierogi-recipe.html">prior post</a>, I play the ukulele.<a href="#fn041" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> There are two reasons I thought it important to bring with me on my trip to London. First, it’s the smallest instrument I know<a href="#fn042" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> that can play chords and harmony, which is nice when I want to sing along with a backing.</p>
<p>The other reason is that I have minimal difficulty playing melodies on it. Whether I’m plucking out an old familiar melody to decide how to accompany it, playing along to my singing new melodies, or picking out new melodies, I can do them all with relative ease. Part of this is that the instrument is tuned to four of five pentatonic notes<a href="#fn043" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> as its four strings. This also means when I want to play something with the dominant as the low note, it’s fairly easy to do, as the pentatonic scale a fourth below C still uses 4 of the 5 notes. The only difference is F instead of E.</p>
<p>All in all, the ukulele is a fun and easy instrument. I would highly recommend anyone to learn it.</p>

<h1 id="arranging-for-bagpipes-part-2"><a href="arranging-for-bagpipes-ii.html">Arranging for Bagpipes Part 2</a> </h1>
<p>As you may remember from my last mention of this topic, some songs are very difficult to arrange for bagpipe. Today, I was lucky enough to find a song that was easy.</p>
<p>I found myself today with the best problem an artist can have: a hyper focused muse. I could not focus on anything else until I had set the hymn “How Can I Keep From Singing” to bagpipes. Unlike the anthem that I previously discussed, this son was far easier. It’s pentatonic,<a href="#fn051" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and only occupies an octave, from the dominant to the dominant. As you may remember, the bagpipe has a range of an octave and a second starting from the subdominant. So, I put the song in the key of d, added a few grace notes, and was done. It’s nice when things go well.</p>

<h1 id="small-changes"><a href="small-changes.html">Small Changes</a> </h1>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>By now, I’m sure you’ve noticed that I’m currently studying in London.<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> As a result, much of the typing I’m doing here is being done on keyboards with the UK’s key layout.<a href="#fn062" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Some of these changes make complete sense to me, like the fact that the pound symbol<a href="#fn063" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> is much easier to type.<a href="#fn064" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Unfortunately, it’s Shift-3, not Shift-4.<a href="#fn065" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Other changes are slightly harder for me to deal with unconsciously. Next to the single quote key ’, they added in a key for pound and tilde. Instead of shift-single giving you double, it instead returns the @ sign. Thankfully, shift-2 therefore gives us ".<a href="#fn066" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Additionally, backslash is next to the left shift key, and the vertical line<a href="#fn067" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> is shift backslash.<a href="#fn068" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Where the backslash should<a href="#fn069" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> be, there is nothing. Those changes have messed me up more than once when typing a password.<a href="#fn0610" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>I’m also switching to using more Windows machines.<a href="#fn0611" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Commands, especially in the browser I use, are sometimes very different, which is an adjustment.

The other reason people seem disbelieving is that I’m not too terribly flexible. I don’t disagree with either assessment, but they don’t affect my choice for one key reason: I dive because I enjoy it, not because I dream of being the best.

<h1 id="dance-nation-review"><a href="dance-nation.html">Dance Nation Review</a></h1>
<p>Today, I had the wonderful opportunity to watch Clare Barron’s <em>Dance Nation</em> at the Almeida Theatre. The show follows a U13 dance squad as it prepares for national qualifying tournaments. What follows is a review.</p>
<h1 id="draft-3">Draft 3</h1>
<p>The show speaks about the sexualization and sexuality of young women. As I share no part of that experience, my review will focus on other aspects of the show.</p>
<p>As many of you know, I was a techie<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> in high school. Perhaps because of that, or perhaps because something about the medium of live theatre really allows the technical aspects to shine forth, I tend to focus a lot more on the technical theatre aspect than the acting. My reviews<a href="#fn082" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> will also likely focus on these.</p>
<p>When we are first allowed on stage, we see a curtain in the murky realm between translucence and transparancy. We can barely make out a mirrored wall behind us, and lights running up the seams. When the show opens, the curtain drops. I was struck by the paneling of the stage. Mirrors made up the entire back wall, with lights strung between each. Throughout the show, the use of the lights as a way to demarcate different areas of the stage and different characters was masterful. However, the panels do not remain mirrors. The first piece of the show that struck me was the paneling of the stage.</p>
<p>Throughout the show, the panels turn and twist about, becoming anything from doors, to black glitter decoration, to a wolf’s head, to a bathroom stall. The use of the panels as entries and exits, as a way to bridge and break scenes, and, at the end, as a way to recognize the disjointed nature of both the show and life is fantastic.</p>
<p>The lighting of the show is also incredibly helpful for setting and moving the scenes along, as well as making the minimal set feel larger. When Luke is on the car ride home with his mother, the moon in the upper right of the stage tells us of the long day he’s had, and connects us to the other dancers, who each have their own memories of the night. As the drive continues, orange lights flow by their faces, reminding the audience of their movement. When Zuzu has a breakdown, the lights become harsher and harsher until her realization comes through.</p>
<p>Continuing to mess with the set, the show did a wonderful job of playing with set as prop and prop as set. Actors tended to carry in the set pieces, or pieces that they worked with remained a part of the show. Always in the wings of the stage were the detritus of a dance studio, reminding that it’s never far away, especially in the minds of the dancers. As the show progresses, the stage becomes more and more cluttered, just as the depth of the characters’ experiences do.</p>
<p>A final note about the set, as means to transition into the acting, all along what is meant to be the ceiling of the room are trophies from dance competitions past. In my experience as an athlete, leaving mementos of victory where they are always visible is meant one of two ways. Either the coach wants to say “you’re a part of a program with past success, and with hard work you can be a part of that too,” or “winning is all that matters. The teams that aren’t up here don’t belong in our memories because they were a failure as a team and as people.”<a href="#fn083" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> This show chose to take the second approach, and took it to the comical extreme that some coaches take it. Not only does the coach point out the one year with no trophy by saying no one remembers them, he then mentions the next year, where a dancer was recruited to become a professional. One of the panels turns and shows us a shrine dedicated to the dancer and all of the dancers chant her name. This is the first of many times throughout the show that the coach and dancers talk about how winning<a href="#fn084" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> is the only important aspect of dance. To quote a common sports saying, “winning isn’t everything, it’s the only thing.” What the show quietly points out, however, is that there is a constant culling of winners. No one the rest of the star’s team. Slowly but surely, in memory and in action, the weak are culled. Only the strong remain.</p>
<p>In the first scene, a dancer gets injured and is never heard from again. Near the end of the show, another dancer makes a mistake and quits as a result. These actions, along with monologues, showcase a dangerous aspect of not only children’s athletics, but also of society. Weakness and failure are not opportunities to grow, but rather signs of being inherently inability. And, since the weak get culled, any mistake means you no longer belong.</p>
<p>All in all though, it was a very enjoyable show.</p>

As an athlete, leaving trophies where they are always visible has in my experience been meant in one of two ways. It either is left to say:“we have a history of hard work and success. Keep that alive,” or “these trophies represent the years we remember and care about. The years without trophies are failures, and the athletes are too.” This show chose to take the second approach, and took it to an almost comical extreme. Not only does the coach point out the one year with no trophy by saying no one remembers them, he then mentions the next year, where a dancer was recruited to become a professional.

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>The first piece of the show that struck me was the paneling of the stage. When the curtain drops to begin the show, the back wall is composed of mirror panels. Throughout the show, the panels are turned and become anything from doors, to black glitter decoration, to a wolf’s head, to a bathroom stall. Throughout the show, the use of the panels as entries and exits, as a way to bridge and break scenes, and, at the end, as a way to recognize the disjointed nature of the show and life is fantastic.</p>
<p>The lighting of the show is also incredibly helpful for setting and moving the scenes along. When Luke is on the car ride home with his mother, the moon in the upper right of the stage tells us of the long day he’s had. As the drive continues, orange lights flow by their faces, showing the audience how they’re moving through time.</p>
<p>In terms of the show itself, the show is set in a dance academy featuring the parts of youth athletics I was so incredibly fortunate to miss out on. These preteens are being told that their future success in life depends wholly on how well they perform at a single show. The coach<a href="#fn088" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> reinforce the idea that it really doesn’t matter whether you’re having fun.<a href="#fn089" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> All that matters is being the best and winning. Weakness isn’t tolerated, and the weak are culled out.</p>
<p>From the first scene, where a dancer gets injured and is never heard from again, through to the end, where a dancer makes a mistake and, as a result, quits dance forever, the idea of mistakes as being reflective of character flaws, and that character flaws (and by extension, those who hold them) should be hidden.</p>
<p>All along what is meant to be the ceiling of the room, there are trophies from dance competitions. As an athlete, leaving trophies where they are always visible can be meant in one of two ways. It can either be: “we have a history of success, and y’all are going to be a part of it,” or “we only care about you if you win.” As you might guess, this show chose the second approach, and took it to an almost comical extreme. Not only does the coach point out the one year with no trophy by saying no one remembers them, he then mentions the next year, where a dancer was recruited to become a professional. He fully tells both the dancers and the crowd that the only important thing about dance is being the best. Even the rest of the famous dancer’s group is forgotten. Only the strong remain.</p>
<p>Returning to painting the scene, the show did a wonderful job of playing with set as prop and prop as set. Actors tended to carry in the set pieces, or pieces that they worked with remained a part of the show. Always in the wings of the stage were the detritus of a dance studio, reminding that it’s never far away.</p>
<p>All in all, it was a very enjoyable show.</p>

<h1 id="a-pierogi-recipe-or-why-i-pronounce-ukulele-the-way-i-do"><a href="pierogi-recipe.html">A Pierogi Recipe: Or Why I Pronounce Ukulele the Way I Do</a></h1>
<h1 id="draft-two">Draft Two</h1>
<p>At first glance, today’s title may seem like a non sequitur.<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> What do pierogi<a href="#fn092" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> have to do with the ukulele?<a href="#fn093" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> No, this title isn’t<a href="#fn094" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> written as an intentional non sequitur to spark my creative energies. Rather, I realized that the same thought processes inform my choice of both making pierogi and pronouncing ukulele.</p>
<p>To understand what I mean by that, at the bottom of today’s essay are two pierogi recipes.<a href="#fn095" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> One of them is a recipe I found online,<a href="#fn096" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> and the other is the recipe I used last time I made pierogi.<a href="#fn097" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> As a bonus, I also include the gluten free pierogi dough recipe I used.<a href="#fn098" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>If you’ve read the recipes, you might notice a few differences between the two recipes.<a href="#fn099" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> The biggest difference to me is in the dough.<a href="#fn0910" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> They use both sour cream and water in their dough, while I don’t use either. My reason for this comes from my formative years, when I learned to make pasta. According to my teacher,<a href="#fn0911" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Italian pasta dough<a href="#fn0912" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> only contains salt, egg, flour, and oil.</p>
<p>Since that dough has worked for everything I ever needed a dough for,<a href="#fn0913" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> I never felt the need to use other pasta doughs.<a href="#fn0914" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> So, when I made my pierogi, I just made dough the way I always do.<a href="#fn0915" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Now, by this point you might be asking what making dumplings has to do with the pronunciation of ukulele.<a href="#fn0916" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> To me, they’re two reflections of the same universal truth: people adapt everything they learn to fit into their prior knowledge and experiences.</p>
<p>In IPA<a href="#fn0917" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> notation, the word ukulele is pronounced<a href="#fn0918" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> /?uku?ll/, which contrasts to the SAE<a href="#fn0919" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> pronunciation of /ju?k?lejli/. This is due to the nature of word movement through languages. When a word is assumed into a new language, it<a href="#fn0920" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> change its pronunciation to align to the new tongues phonological rules. In Hawaiian, there is no schwa,<a href="#fn0921" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> while SAE uses the schwa almost exclusively in unstressed syllables. Additionally, SAE almost never begins words with vowel /u/<a href="#fn0922" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a>. So, when the Hawaiian word entered the SAE lexicon, the /j/<a href="#fn0923" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> was added, to make it align with the rules of the language.</p>
<p>Now, both of these changes to the word are fine and natural, at least to me.<a href="#fn0924" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> But, I’ve heard and seen complaints about the both how to pronounce ukulele, and, indirectly about how to make pierogi. To be specific, I’ve been told that the way I pronounce the word “ukulele” is wrong, since the word is pronounced differently in the language of origin. Additionally, there are many people who feel that changing a culture’s recipe<a href="#fn0925" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> is wrong.<a href="#fn0926" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>To me, both of those erase the idea of positive change, which is makes the world beautiful and exciting. Should I stop calling what I make pierogi because I don’t use an “authentic” recipe?<a href="#fn0927" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> Should I try to relearn the phonological system of my native tongue to accommodate a single word?<a href="#fn0928" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> I personally don’t think so, and that’s where today’s title comes. Both the way I make pierogi and the way I pronounce ukulele come from the background and mental connections I made before encountering the idea.</p>
<h1 id="draft-one">Draft One</h1>
<p>At first glance, the title may seem like a non sequitur.<a href="#fn0929" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> What do pierogi<a href="#fn0930" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> have to do with the ukulele?<a href="#fn0931" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> No, this title isn’t<a href="#fn0932" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> written as a non sequitur as a way to spark my creative energies. Instead, while reflecting on my recipe for pierogi, especially in context with “authentic” recipes I’ve read, it occured to me that I feel similarly about pierogi and the pronunciation of the word ukulele.</p>
<p>To understand what I mean by that, below are two pierogi recipes. One of them is the recipe I found online,<a href="#fn0933" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> and the other is the recipe I used last time I made pierogi.<a href="#fn0934" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> As a bonus, I’ll also put in the gluten free pierogi dough recipe I came up with.<a href="#fn0935" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>So, you might notice a few differences between the two recipes.<a href="#fn0936" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> The biggest difference to me is in the dough. They use both sour cream and water in their dough, while I don’t use either. This mostly comes from when I first learned how to make pasta. According to the person teaching me,<a href="#fn0937" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> Italian pasta dough<a href="#fn0938" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> only has salt, egg, flour, and oil.</p>
<p>Since that dough has worked for everything I ever needed a dough for,<a href="#fn0939" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> I never felt the need to change it. So, when I made my pierogi, I just made dough the way I always do.</p>

<h1 id="recipes">Recipes</h1>
<h2 id="from-internet">From Internet</h2>
<p>For the dough:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>3-1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</p></li>
<li><p>3 large eggs</p></li>
<li><p>2 tablespoons sour cream</p></li>
<li><p>3/4 cup water</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Filling:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>2 cups mashed potatoes</p></li>
<li><p>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</p></li>
<li><p>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</p></li>
<li><p>1/2 teaspoon salt</p></li>
<li><p>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</p></li>
<li><p>1 cup grated cheddar cheese</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Since pierogi making instructions, like most dumplings, are effectively just “make dough,” “make filling,” “put filling in dough,” I elide them here.</p>
<h2 id="from-memory">From Memory</h2>
<p>For the dough:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1 egg</p></li>
<li><p>olive oil in equal amount to the volume of egg</p></li>
<li><p>sprinkle salt</p></li>
<li><p>sprinkle black pepper</p></li>
<li><p>flour to correct consistency</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For the Gluten Free Dough:<a href="#fn0952" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>1 egg</p></li>
<li><p>olive oil in just under amount of egg volume</p></li>
<li><p>sprinkle salt</p></li>
<li><p>sprinkle black pepper</p></li>
<li><p>white rice flour to correct consistency</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Filling:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>5 pounds potato, peeled<a href="#fn0953" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>1 lb cream cheese</p></li>
<li><p>1/2 pound butter</p></li>
<li><p>2 red onions</p></li>
<li><p>5 cloves garlic</p></li>
<li><p>olive oil as needed</p></li>
<li><p>sharp cheddar to taste</p></li>
<li><p>salt and pepper to taste</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To make the filling, boil the potatoes, mince garlic and fry with onion in olive oil until caramalized. Drain potatoes when soft, then add everything together, mixing well.</p>
<p>To make the dough, all ingredients but flour in a bowl, then slowly add flour until solid enough to handle. Move onto a floured workspace and add more flour until the correct consistency.</p>
