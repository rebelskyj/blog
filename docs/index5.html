<p>Today I pr’d again, though by far less. My coach says I missed my entries, which is true.</p>

<p>I pr’d by 50 points in diving today, which was approximately 17%! I’m very excited about this.</p>

<p>Today, I got to watch my little brother at one of his last high school swim meets. During it, he lost his goggles as he started his 100 butterfly. And then he set a new personal best, by a not-insignificant margin. It’s sad when that happens, because now there’s an incentive to dive goggleless.</p>

<p>First Published: 2019 January 13</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>We’re getting ready to return to Grinnell. As a result, we decided to clear out our food. We had around two pounds of bread, a pound of brown sugar, salt,<a href="#fn051" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and a packet of yeast. So, I decided to make bread.</p>
<p>With the one packet of yeast added to most of the flour, I dumped in the very precise measurements of “some” salt and brown sugar. That being accomplished,<a href="#fn052" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> I added water to the flour. As I realized that there was still far too much flour, I found out we also had extra milk. So, I added more flour, and I<a href="#fn053" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> added milk to the flour, and continued to work.</p>
<p>I then got bored while kneading, so picked up the dough and kneaded as I walked and visited other rooms. After letting it rise for 2.5 hours,<a href="#fn054" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> I rekneaded, and let rest for the entirely unreasonable length of 3 minutes.<a href="#fn055" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> I put it in the oven and walked away for ten minutes.</p>
<p>When I returned, the bread looked more like a cake. It had risen quite nicely. Of course, it wasn’t browning, even after 30 minutes, so I bumped the temp from 350 to 400.<a href="#fn056" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> It still didn’t brown, but did turn a nice light brown colour.<a href="#fn057" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Reviews from housemates were positive. As for myself, I’d give it a solid neutral. As my father would say, “c’est la vie.”<a href="#fn058" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>First Published: 2019 January 16</p>
<p>Isaiah 40:1: “Comfort, give comfort to my people, says your God.”</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today’s readings, as are to be expected from the day of the Lord’s baptism, are rather joyful. To me, the line which best sums up this week’s message is the first of Isaiah Chapter 40. The readings focus on the comfort and knowledge that the Lord has come, loves us, and chooses us each and every day.</p>
<p>In the Gospel itself, I love the fact that Luke makes it clear that “the Holy Spirit descended upon him in <strong>bodily form</strong>,”<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#fn062" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> while the other two synoptic Gospels only state that the Spirit descends. For me, at least, part of the faith that is so important is the physical nature. As we’re taught about sacraments, they’re physical manifestations of internal realities. Unlike other Christian faiths, we believe that the Body and Blood is truly present in the Eucharist.</p>

<p>These past few days, my coach has commented that my hurdle has been suffering since coming back from abroad.

<p>First Published: 2019 January 11</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>In a class I took last semester, Creative Cartography, one of the ways we experimented with making maps was via timelapses. I very much enjoyed the process, and repeated it later in the making of the growing of my beard.<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> When I shaved my beard, I again tried a timelapse. And, recently, I tried doing so while working on a doodle that I enjoyed.</p>
<p>It’s a really fun process, and it’s a good way for me personally to do activities more mindfully. If you haven’t tried making them in the past, I’d recommend trying to make one, as it’s very rewarding.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I made tortillas.<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> They were favorably reviewed.</p>
<p>The recipe is:</p>

<li><p>Mix and knead</p></li>
