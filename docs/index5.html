<p>First Published: 2023 June 14</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>About eighteen months ago <a href="spoons-and-spell-slots.html">I wrote a post</a> about having<a href="#fn001" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> the energy to do the things that I want and need to do. Since then, I have been trying to figure out what leads me to feeling better and worse and being more and less productive. Thankfully, feeling better is generally well correlated for me with being productive.</p>
<p>One trend that I was positive that I had noticed was that I am far more productive when I am well rested. Yesterday, I was all set to write a whole blog post about how the sleep that I had yet to catch up on was going to make it so I had no way to catch up on my writing. But, I had other tasks that I needed to do.<a href="#fn002" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>So, I set timers and started writing my book during the breaks that I had between timed activities. I almost effortlessly wrote the entire chapter, which made my planned post obsolete. Instead, I got to write about the reason I hadn’t been posting, which was nice. While getting a theory disproven is less than the best feeling, it was a nice thing to learn. Looking back on the times that I am more or less productive, it seems like sleep is important, though not for the reason that I had initially believed.</p>
<p>I still find a correlation with sleep and productivity, though I think that there is an important intermediate step or two. One thing that forces productivity in me is the lack of ability to do something else. Of course, I mean that entirely in the subjective sense. Last night, there was nothing stopping me from sitting and reading a book or watching YouTube.<a href="#fn003" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> However, the fact that I knew that I needed to write a book and revise a presentation meant that I was able to write. When I’m more tired, I think that I’m more able to remember that deadlines I set are fake and only affect me.</p>
<p>Another, though fairly well linked issue is that I often lose track of time. I’ll look up from an activity and hours will have passed. Even tonight is no exception. I sat down and it was a little after five. Looking up again, it’s now nearly eight. Where the hours went, I’m not totally sure. However, I do find that my ability to keep track of time is improved with sleep.</p>
<p>So, between those two issues, I still do see why I am more productive when well rested, for all that I don’t know if they’re quite as absolute as I thought. Since this musing is a little shorter than I want, let’s talk about the predecessing<a href="#fn004" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> post about mental space. I find it interesting that I continually look at scheduling my life as a potential solution. Intellectually, it very well could be, but I have such an aversion to scheduling myself that I don’t know if it will be probable for me without changing something major about my life.</p>
<p>I mused about the time sink that is YouTube<a href="#fn005" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. I believed that I was actively lacking energy more, which I don’t know if is true. I did say that I need to eat more, because I was exhausted. More and more, I find that I become exhausted feeling when I don’t have enough water. I think that was certainly true of me while writing that post.</p>
<p>All in all, I think it’s nice that I can make myself work by lying to myself and saying that I need to. I wish that there were better ways for me to do so, but I don’t know how to find them.</p>

<h1 id="wedding-recap"><a href="wedding.html">Wedding Recap</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 June 13</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Well, it’s been almost a week since my last blog post. Instead of excuses, I think I’ll make what has become a rarity amongst my blog posts<a href="#fn011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and give a quick recap of where I’ve been.</p>
<p>Last Friday, I woke up at 2 am to start a four hour drive to an airport. From there, I traveled across the country to go to a friend’s wedding. While I could have made time during that day, I did not have the mental energy to do so. It ended up being more packed of a day than I expected, though I should have expected more, given that there was a rehearsal dinner and wedding. The rehearsal dinner was held overlooking a beautiful gorge with a fantastic waterfall.<a href="#fn012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>What I’m assured was six hours of sleep later, I woke to Saturday. On that day, two of my dear friends got married. It was a lovely ceremony and day. I don’t know what the bride did to get ready, but the groom spent much of his morning in prayer with his groomsmen.<a href="#fn013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> At the wedding, I had been asked to sing and I volunteered<a href="#fn014" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> to play the bagpipes.</p>
<p>After the wedding, I had a wonderful time at the reception, meeting the newlyweds’ friends and family and dancing.<a href="#fn015" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> It ended two or so hours later than expected, and the groomsmen<a href="#fn016" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> spent some time that night bonding without the groom.</p>
<p>In the morning, even more sleep deprived, I went to Mass with some of the bridal party who were still in the town. The Parish was hosting a pancake breakfast, so I went to that with some friends who met the bride and groom at a similar time.<a href="#fn017" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Following that, I rode the two hours back to the airport with one of the bridesmaids and her partner. That was a really fun car ride! We bonded over a love of fantasy and other things.<a href="#fn018" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> I taught them “my cows,” which is truly the pinnacle of car games.</p>
<p>At the airport, I ran into another friend who was at the wedding. We were scheduled to take the same flight back. As it was ready to board, though, we were told that it was delayed for seven hours.</p>
<p>Three hours later, after waiting through the entire line to die, we went to ask for a meal voucher. Instead, we were given hotel rooms and new flights. I was scheduled to fly out yesterday,<a href="#fn019" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> and he was scheduled for today. Thankfully, we were able to reschedule to the same flight.</p>
<p>We carpooled in a Lyft to the hotel,<a href="#fn0110" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> ate dinner,<a href="#fn0111" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> and went to sleep. In the morning, I realized it was Monday, rushed to finish the chapter of my web serial, posted it, and ate breakfast. Back at the airport, I ran into the newlyweds, wished them congratulations, and saw that there was a flight boarding to my destination.</p>
<p>Thankfully, they were willing and able to seat my friend and I on this earlier flight, and we made it back a full three hours earlier than expected, which was great. On the downside, I’m now exhausted and missed the only full day of lab work I had the chance for this week.<a href="#fn0112" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Still, I’m far too glad with the fact that I was able to share my music with my friends at their wedding to mind.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Friends coming over is on indefinite hold</p></li>
<li><p>Took a five day hiatus from blogging</p></li>
<li><p>Danced so much that my entire body was sore for two days</p></li>
<li><p>Woke up at six most of the days in the interim, for all that I did not want to.</p></li>
<li><p>The groom and wedding made prayer easy, but I really fell off of it when the air travel got delayed.</p></li>
<li><p>I fell technically a little behind, and posted a too short chapter. I’m almost finished with tomorrow’s though, which is nice. I’m hopeful I can get Friday’s cleared out by the end of tomorrow.</p></li>

<h1 id="book-review-of-after-the-dragons"><a href="book-review-after-dragons.html">Book Review of After the Dragons</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 June 8</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>For as much as the books I read tend to fall into the categories of: recommended to me, read already, closely related to a book recommended to me,<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I do also read other books. It’s sometimes hard to find books that don’t fit into one of those categories, but that’s just because I am surrounded by a number of book-lovers with distinct tastes and have a very low bar for what counts as closely related. That being said, I’m usually glad when I do.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I went to the library to check out a copy of Art Spiegelman’s <em>Maus.</em><a href="#fn022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> While I was there, I walked by the table of new arrivals.<a href="#fn023" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> I saw a book called “After the Dragons,” by Cynthia Zhang, and decided to give it a read.</p>
<p>It’s squarely in the realm of Magic Realism<a href="#fn024" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>, which is a genre that I think more people need to be exposed to. Magic Realism is subtly different than Urban Fantasy, though the distinction is important. In Urban Fantasy, Magic is at least on some level hidden from the average person, or was.<a href="#fn025" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Some popular examples of Urban Fantasy are the Harry Potter series, Lilo and Stitch,<a href="#fn026" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Twilight, and Dracula.</p>
<p>Magic Realism, by contrast, is where we have our existing society, but Magic is just there. I keep seeing claims that it originated in South America, but I’ve seen plenty of examples of it in Russian literature. As an example, I would argue that Kafka’s Metamorphisis is one, though there are newer ones for sure. Disney’s Encanto or Turning Red would also be clear examples of the genre. I would also argue that Frankenstein fits better into this genre. A lot of Stephen King’s works fit here as well.</p>
<p>Anyways, four hundred words of exposition later, After the Dragons takes place in China, where dragons are slowly going extinct due to man-made pollution.<a href="#fn027" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> We follow a Chinese-American here on a study-abroad equivalent<a href="#fn028" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> who slowly falls in love with a Chinese man who has a degenerative illness. Dragons are how the two meet and bond, as the student wants to study them, and the Chinese man takes care of feral dragons that he finds on the streets.</p>
<p>It was a quick read, but an enjoyable one. There were some lines in the book that screamed propaganda to me, but I’ve been told I’m overly sensitive to that. Because the book was so short, though, I felt like there were a lot of portions that I would have preferred be fleshed out more. I would still recommend someone read it, though I wouldn’t read it again without a real<a href="#fn029" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> reason.</p>
<p>Immediate edit: Whoops! I published this before realizing I didn’t do my daily reflection.</p>

<h1 id="reflection-on-monthly-reflections"><a href="reflection-monthly-reflection.html">Reflection on Monthly Reflections</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 June 7</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>On thing that I’ve realized is less than ideal in my monthly reflections is that they are in many respects write-only memory.<a href="#fn031" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> That’s sort of an issue, especially since I tend to have forward facing goals in each reflection. One way I think I might be able to address the issues is by looking at each of my goals in each day’s blog post.<a href="#fn032" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>My goals this month were broken into finite and infinite tasks, which may have been better framed as timed<a href="#fn033" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> and untimed.<a href="#fn034" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> I don’t think that reflecting on the finite tasks will be particularly helpful, so I’m only going to focus on the growth ones in my daily reflections. I’m going to take the rest of this post to expound on the one line goals that I have.</p>
<p>I haven’t invited anyone over to my home yet, and it’s starting to become messy again. I should really spend some time this afternoon getting my home cleaner. In general, I would really love to have my default vision of my home as something that is clean, rather than one that is not.</p>
<p>I have been blogging fairly often, though I suppose I did miss a few days already. Of the goals that I wanted to write about, I think that I’ve gone through all of them except for piping interactions and book reviews. I’d like to blog about handwriting again, since that’s coming up in my life.</p>
<p>Exercising three times a week has been not happening. I’ve gone for one run since the month started. I think making time to go to the gym after lunch might be a good idea today!<a href="#fn035" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> At the implicit<a href="#fn036" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> recommendation of a friend, I’ve also been considering doing personal training, if only because it would be nice to know that I’m approaching things in somewhat of the right direction for my goals.</p>
<p>Sleeping enough and getting up at six have remained fairly at odds. The past few days, while I’ve generally woken up at six, I then immediately changed my alarm to seven thirty<a href="#fn037" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> and returned to sleep.</p>
<p>Making time for prayer has been a mixed bag. On Sunday, I certainly did. Yesterday, I remembered to pray a rosary. In general, though, I do find that I waste my time on pointless distractions, and I would rather spend that time in prayer.<a href="#fn038" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>I’m currently<a href="#fn039" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> about a quarter of a chapter ahead on my book, which is slightly behind where I would like to be if I’m trying to evenly get to five chapters ahead. Getting one full chapter ahead by the end of the day would be fantastic.</p>
<p>Writing a song is going mixedly. I realized that every song I write turns into some variation of a love song, or at least an ode to someone. I tried to go through the list of songs that I like to see what common themes in them are. In what should have been unsurprising, most of them are love-adjacent songs. The rest of them generally have some sort of folk or union vibe, which I can’t personally relate to. Still, I’m working on a<a href="#fn0310" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> new song that I started last night, and I do have hopes of actually finishing it.</p>
<p>Writing letters to friends has not happened at all. I’m planning to write one today. It’s interesting though, I never realize how bad my writer’s block is until I try to write a letter.</p>
<p>That does bring me to an interesting piece of introspection, which is that I find that tasks that I don’t want to do often feel nebulous until I make concrete what the issue is. Here, I know that the issue is just writing the letter, so I’m going to take a break from writing this musing to write the letter.<a href="#fn0311" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> That took me all of about fifteen minutes, at least half of which was dealing with pencil lead. Still, it’s nice that I’ve written a letter to a friend!<a href="#fn0312" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>So, I think that I’ll just replace the items within the list below this each day with quick updates on each task:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Progress towards friends over<a href="#fn0313" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Blog-ress<a href="#fn0314" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Exercise progress</p></li>
<li><p>Sleep and rise at six</p></li>
<li><p>Pray and make time for it</p></li>
<li><p>Backlog building</p></li>
<li><p>Songsmithing</p></li>
<li><p>Letters to Friends</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully this will help me to actually accomplish my monthly goals!</p>

<p>First Published: 2023 June 6</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Oh wow, it’s been a few months since the last time I blogged about going to open mics. I think it’s been about that long since I went to an open mic, which is sadder. It’s hard for me to balance going to the open mic, which I enjoy, and going to sleep early, which I enjoy <a href="do-versus-done.html">having done</a>.<a href="#fn041" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Still, when a friend said that they missed my presence at open mics<a href="#fn042" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, I decided it was time to dust<a href="#fn043" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> off my old<a href="#fn044" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> guitar.</p>
<p>It was hard for me to pick what I would play. For one, while I have been playing guitar, that has mostly meant doing some picking patterns, some scales, and a few songs that I don’t love singing along to in public.<a href="#fn045" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> My staple open mic songs are all fairly stale, which also didn’t seem like an ideal situation. So, like all great folk musicians,<a href="#fn046" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> I retuned my guitar to DADGAD.<a href="#fn047" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> I’d been working on a Great Big Sea song<a href="#fn048" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> that’s in Celtic tuning<a href="#fn049" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>, and I felt like I probably knew a Stan Roger’s song<a href="#fn0410" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> well enough to do them.</p>
<p>As it turns out, I knew the Great Big Sea song well enough, and I stumbled through the end of the Stan Rogers’<a href="#fn0411" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> piece. Also I learned a fun fact! My throat feeling clogged before open mics is most likely a consequence of having brassicas<a href="#fn0412" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> and not being nervous, as I had historically believed!</p>

<h1 id="on-doing-versus-having-done"><a href="do-versus-done.html">On Doing Versus Having Done</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 June 3</p>
<p>Prereading note: sorry, this one got really rambly. I should probably fix it up at some point</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Like many people, I wish that I did more.<a href="#fn051" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> At the very least, I wish I had better knowledge of where my hours went.</p>
<p>As a result, I have tried a number of things to get my life in order.<a href="#fn052" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> None of them have worked as well as I would like, but the struggle a few weeks ago did lead me to think more deeply about what my priorities really are.</p>
<p>I was making a list of activities that I wanted to complete. Some of them were things that I enjoy doing in and of themselves<a href="#fn053" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, and some are things that I enjoy the knowledge that I have done them.<a href="#fn054" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> It made me think of a nice two dimensional way to rank different activities.</p>
<p>The two axis<a href="#fn055" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> titles that I settled on were do and done. What does that mean? Great question.</p>
<p>Do is tasks where doing them is itself the goal. For instance, I like reading because it’s a fun task and I enjoy doing it. It may benefit me, but even without the growth it causes, it’s something I’m glad to do. As I write, I realize I should have started with done, so onward.</p>
<p>Done is what I described as tasks that I do not necessarily enjoy the process of completing them, but I enjoy the knowledge that I have done them. As I mentioned in a footnote, running is really my best example of this. Every time that I run, I find it an unpleasant experience. Nevertheless, every time that I look back on a time that I have run, I am grateful to myself for having run.</p>
<p>Another way to think of it is future versus present enjoyment. Things that I enjoy doing bring me enjoyment in the present, as I do them. Things that I enjoy having done, by contrast, bring me enjoyment when I look back on the fact that I did them.</p>
<p>I have no clue if that made any sense, but it does mean that I can group most of the activities I do into four quadrants. Ideally, I would like to spend all of my time doing things that I enjoy doing and having done. Equally ideally, I would spend none of my time doing things that I neither enjoy doing nor having done.</p>
<p>As I made my list, though, it occurred to me that ranking the other two categories is an interesting values judgement. If I prioritize things that I enjoy having done, then I will likely enjoy each day less.<a href="#fn056" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> On the other hand, if I prioritize things that I enjoy doing, I am likely to stagnate in most of my endeavors.</p>
<p>Returning once more to my realm of ideals, it would be fantastic if I was able to learn to enjoy in the moment all of the activities that I enjoy having done. If running became fun, for instance, I am sure that I would run more.</p>
<p>As I think about my day, though, I realize that I spend a lot of time doing things that I neither enjoy doing nor having done. That’s probably not great for me. Partially, it could be that I have the wrong framing for some tasks I accomplish. Failing to do something, for instance, could be reframed as setting me up for a future success and therefore a thing that I enjoyed having done.</p>
<p>That is not most of what I find lives in that quadrant, though. I am very easily sucked into time sinks.<a href="#fn057" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> I know while I am in them that I will not be glad for having spent my time on them in the future. Even while I do them, I am not so much enjoying what I am doing as killing time.</p>
<p>I only have so much time, and it would be great if I stopped trying to kill it.</p>

<h1 id="universe-in-the-park-part-3-1"><a href="universe.html">Universe in the Park (Part 3? 1?)</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 June 2</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As I mentioned <a href="reflection-may-23.html">yesterday</a>, I gave a talk this past Saturday. It was a part of my university’s<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> “Universe in the Park” series. I went to a State Wildlife Area<a href="#fn062" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> and gave the first of what is currently<a href="#fn063" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> scheduled to be six<a href="#fn064" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> talks this summer.</p>
<p>My talk changed a lot from what I gave last year. Last year, I had titled my talk “Prebiotic Chemistry in the Interstellar Medium,” which is not, in retrospect, as good of a title as I had thought. With the added wisdom of almost ten additional months, I revised the slide deck almost completely. It is now titled “Searching for the Origins of Life in the Coldest Regions of Space”, a much more evocative title.<a href="#fn065" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>My first talk went really well I think, all things considered. The general format of a Universe in the Park presentation is giving a short-ish lecture<a href="#fn066" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>, answering audience questions until they run out,<a href="#fn067" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> and then using a telescope until either the park is closed or everyone is bored. Despite now being trained to use the telescope’s GPS features, I used very little of them.</p>
<p>Mostly, people wanted to look at the moon, which is fair. Unfortunately the viewfinder<a href="#fn068" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> had gotten misaligned from the viewing scope, and I didn’t want people to have to wait for the<a href="#fn069" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> five minutes it would take to align them together. Instead, everyone got to see the moon through the viewfinder, and then I coupled the two.</p>
<p>It was then that I learned just how quickly the moon moves through the sky. I found that I needed to adjust the sight every four or five people.<a href="#fn0610" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Every time that I did, at least three mosquitoes took their chance to bite my face, leading to more than a few jerks. Thankfully, the moon is<a href="#fn0611" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> bright enough that I was able to quickly adjust it back by following its aura.</p>
<p>After everyone viewed the moon and was impressed by its many craters<a href="#fn0612" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>, I moved the view to Venus, both to use the GPS alignment and because it’s the only other object I think is cool to look at in the sky. Switching out the optic for a more powerful one, people were able to see that Venus, like the moon,<a href="#fn0613" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> has shaded regions.</p>
<p>At that point, the number of people there was dwindling. I pointed the telescope to a few stars<a href="#fn0614" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>, and people all filed out by ten pm or so. It still wasn’t even fully dark, not that I’m complaining.</p>
<p>I even got feedback from the park person.<a href="#fn0615" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> It’s mostly irrelevant, except for a quote which I want to exemplify more daily, “It covered the science behind space much more in depth than I thought it would, which was fine. But he also, related it well to what people would know about, including kids. He also was not thrown off by any questions that were asked”. I choose to interpret this as meaning I went in depth but still kept people engaged. What more could I hope for as a scientist communicating to the public?</p>

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Oh wow, it’s been over two weeks since my last post. I have no clue where the days go. I did write around 36000 words last month, so that’s somewhat exciting, even if almost none of them were for this blog.</p>
<p>My goals <a href="reflection-april-23.html">last month</a> broke into a few categories. If I had checked up on them, I’m sure that it would have been useful to have them in that order. Instead, I just forgot that they existed until I began writing this post.</p>

<li><p>Probably because of the above item’s issues, I did not finish building the other instrument.</p></li>
<li><p>I did finish TAing and I even got mostly positive reviews!</p></li>
<li><p>I prepared for a talk at a state wildlife area, which is apparently distinct from a state park. It went really well, and I had 53 people come! I should absolutely blog about that, so expect a post soon.</p></li>

<li><p>I deep cleaned my home to at least my own standards.</p></li>
<li><p>I finished the book I didn’t enjoy and managed to at least stay on the writing schedule I needed for the one I am enjoying. I kept hoping to pull ahead but haven’t managed it yet.</p></li>
<li><p>I am now I think good enough at bagpipes to where I won’t embarrass myself next week. There are a shocking number of interactions I have had related to playing the pipes these past weeks, which also deserve a posting of their own.</p></li>
<li><p>I don’t think that I played particularly more music, but I don’t know if I dislike that too much.</p></li>
<li><p>I spent some time working on a song but not enough to break the wall of writer’s block. I should really just get back into writing poetry.<a href="#fn072" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Growth:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I have off and on been able to make more time for prayer.</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote none letters, though I did see friends in person!</p></li>
<li><p>Oof, I did not blog daily. I blogged half as much last month as in April.</p></li>
<li><p>I ran I think zero times.</p></li>
<li><p>I mostly stopped working out.</p></li>
<li><p>I actually did manage to go to bed generally early! My default wake time has shifted to be nearly six am now which is nice.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Looking forward at this month, I would like to:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Play bagpipes at a friend’s wedding</p></li>
<li><p>Write and give a talk at a conference</p></li>
<li><p>Get my instrument running</p></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Start exercising at least three times a week</p></li>
<li><p>Push myself to actually sleep enough and still get up at six.</p></li>
<li><p>Make time for prayer</p></li>
<li><p>Get five chapters ahead on the book I’m writing</p></li>
<li><p>Write a song</p></li>
<li><p>Write at least three letters to friends</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>This might be a better way to frame my goals. In general, there are things that I want to have accomplished, and things I want to do.<a href="#fn076" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Hopefully I’ll be able to keep up with this more!</p>

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today I updated my <a href="twenty-four.html">twenty four for twenty four goal</a><a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, which feels like as good of a reason to restart this blog as any. On an impulse, I copied <a href="rolls.html">an old blog post</a>, because I was intrigued by what the title meant. Interestingly, while discussing the definitions of <a href="roll">i</a>n my life, I didn’t discuss the diving/gymnastics centered meaning of the word.</p>
<p>Anyways, one experiment that I was given to rebuild as a part of my PhD progress has the goal of creating a standing plasma. Last week I successfully produced a plasma for the first time in the instrument in over half a decade, which is incredible to me. Now I need to optimize the plasma and make it usable for what we need.<a href="#fn082" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>First Published: 2023 May 4</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>It was just <a href="writathon-23-april.html">yesterday</a> that I talked about how I’d like to keep up writing even though I no longer need to. As it turns out, I am incredibly motivated by deadlines. Without the explicit need to write 2000 words to put out a chapter today, I didn’t end up writing more than 1000 total words, and almost all of those came after 5pm. I need to think of how to make myself write even when there’s not a deadline. At worst, that seems like a skill I should be able to transfer.</p>
