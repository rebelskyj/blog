<p>Once more, playing DnD with the same DM. This time we did a session zero for a new campaign. I’m going to be playing a Firbolg Star Druid. I need to come up with some inspiration for the character by our next meeting, so expect me to post on here at least once about it.</p>

<p>Yesterday I led my first day of class as a Catechist. That is, I was responsible for leading the discussion amongst a group of middle schoolers on the first four commandments. It went much better than I had expected.</p>

<p>So species counterpoint reflection is on Wednesdays now. Fourth species is an interesting challenge to me. More than any other species<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, it makes me want to work entirely back to front.</p>
<p>That is, I know what note I want to end on, and the penultimate note and often antipenultimate note. Once I’ve gotten those notes, the way that suspensions works means that I often have at most a single choice to meet the rules. It’s kind of interesting in a way.</p>
<p>That being said, I for sure need to spend at least the full week on fourth species. It’s not intuitive for me yet.</p>

<p>I talked about how I do better with doing things when they’re scheduled, and how I do better with schedules when I know what’s scheduled. With that in mind, it seems useful to plan out what I’ll practice on my instruments.</p>
<p>Much as I love accordion, it’s more of an ordeal to practice, so I find that I don’t do it as much, especially when I’m tired. So, on days when I lack energy, my practice will be playing through a song on guitar and doing a scale.</p>
<p>If I have mental energy again,<a href="#fn031" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I would like to try to learn at least a song every two weeks.<a href="#fn032" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> That way I can keep the open mics spiced up. I’d ideally like to do most of these on accordion.</p>

<h2 id="year-breakdown">Year Breakdown</h2>
<p>As with <a href="restarting.html">my</a> last <a href="ending-18.html">two</a> yearly reflections, I’m going to start with five positive things that happened to me in 2022, and five things I’m excited for in 2023.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Passing my second year exam</p></li>
<li><p>Getting an accordion!</p></li>
<li><p>Restarting this blog!</p></li>
<li><p>Writing two books</p></li>
<li><p>Learning that I can run 5 miles when I need to.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at the five things I was excited for in 2022, there’s a lot of overlap. As always, though, more wonderful things happened than I could have ever expected.</p>
<p>As I look to the coming year, I’m excited to/for:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Passing my third year exam</p></li>
<li><p>Self-publishing a book</p></li>
<li><p>Taking an improv class</p></li>
<li><p>Watching my littlest brother graduate</p></li>
<li><p>Growing in my relationships</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="reflection-on-december">Reflection on December</h2>
<p>My goals last month were:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Blog every day.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch every day.</p></li>
<li><p>Write another 50000 word book.</p></li>
<li><p>Catch up on BiaY.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I accomplished the final one of those only. That’s kind of sad, but I suppose natural.</p>
<p>Looking into 2023, I’ve <a href="new-year-plans-23.html">already planned out most of it.</a></p>
<p>This month in particular, I would like to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Blog daily. I have faith in myself.</p></li>
<li><p>Listen to the BiaY and CCCiaY on average once a day each</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch daily</p></li>
<li><p>Write a poem a day</p></li>
<li><p>Write a piece of music a day</p></li>
<li><p>Write through Chapter 35 of the book I’m self publishing</p></li>
<li><p>Practice music daily</p></li>
<li><p>Say a rosary a day</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="theme">Theme</h2>
<p>I think my theme is going to be Schedule. I find that my life works better the less I leave what I do to chance, and so I want to regiment out my day more. I’ve tried using auto-generated lists these past few days for the things I want to do daily, and that’s been really helpful.</p>
<p>Happy 2023!</p>

<p>Today is the Solemnity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Mother of God. It’s historically also the Feast of the Circumcision. Despite the nominal focus on Mary, the readings seem to focus more on the old celebration to me.</p>
<p>The readings focus on Christ’s fulfillment of the messianic prophecy.</p>

<p>It’s the last day of the year, which <a href="ending-18.html">last time I wrote on</a>, I focused on the last year. I hadn’t taken to more formal reflections then, which I think I will do on the second.<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Instead, I’m going to treat today as a<a href="#fn062" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> standard Saturday post, and talk about me week in species counterpoint.</p>
<p>Once again, I managed to do the counterpoint every day. Like last week, I again decided to switch on Wednesday, this time from second to third species. I think I’ve gotten the hang of third species well enough that next week I’m going to start on fourth species.</p>
<p>I can definitely feel my composition chops getting better. As I remarked to a friend, I felt like I was at the cusp of conscious incompetence and competence. Now I feel like I’m well into the conscious competence, and edging into the unconscious competence again. The lines I’m writing generally meet all the rules of species counterpoints, and I’m starting to see more or less accidental motifs arising, as well as better general contouring in the line.</p>
<p>Once again, I’m excited to see how well it transfers.</p>
<p>The rules here are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Off-beat whole notes</p></li>
<li><p>Dissonances resolve step-wise down</p></li>
<li><p>No parallel fifths and octaves</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I think I may have found a solution to my idea earlier of having a way to track my life. Like most people, I do better with to do lists. I found out today how to have my phone generate a to-do list that autopopulates with the activities I need to do every day. It’s nice that these features exist.</p>

<p>Apparently I have the same ideas for writing week-by-week. That’s kind of funny, but I hope that changes soon.</p>
<p>Anyways, these past few days, I’ve managed to get a chapter a day written, which is really nice. The chapters have been differently good, and have needed different amounts of revision. I’ve started using the chapters as ways to test on different ways to write better/more efficiently.</p>
<p>As it turns out, if spend five minutes plotting a chapter before I write it, it comes out much better and faster. I don’t know why that works, but it’s nice to know. On the other hand, it means that I need to know where my journal is at all times.</p>
<p>That’s nice, because I want to get through my journals faster. So yeah, I’m going to try to do that more.</p>

<p>What a coincidence, apparently I need one week to do each counterpoint, at least so far. Anyways, time to move on from <a href="species-counterpoint-2.html">second species counterpoint</a> to third species.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the rules are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Consonant downbeats<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, with preference to imperfect consonances<a href="#fn092" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>No note to note parallel perfect unisons<a href="#fn093" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>No hidden (parallel) perfect intervals<a href="#fn094" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Offbeat disonances must be approached and left stepwise<a href="#fn095" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Four notes written per note in the cantus firmus</p></li>
<li><p>Generally prioritize small skips and step-wise movement, with octave as the exception</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Shockingly, third species did not feel significantly harder. On a first pass, I only made my “fourths are consonant” mistake once, and the revision I did focused more on having a meaningful melody, which was nice to be able to have. I am excited to see if this helps me with composing next week.</p>
