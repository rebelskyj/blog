<p>First Published: 2023 August 28</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Apparently I’ve never written about my family’s book club.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> That doesn’t necessarily mean that I haven’t but I can’t find it, so it doesn’t count right now.</p>
<p>So, what is the family book club?<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Well, you need to come with me back to the far off time of 2018?<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> My father messaged one of our family group chats<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> about a book he thought we should all read.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> I<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> then replied that we should have a family book club. The rest of my family agreed, and so we have all taken turns<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> choosing a book for us all to read.</p>
<p>Each book club begins with a few standard questions.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>We all give a thumbs up, down, or to the side for whether we enjoyed the book or not. The one who chose the book says why they picked it. We all give our big picture opinions on the book.</p>
<p>Then, because we exclusively read digitally, we go through the ebook that we have all annotated<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> and read through each comment and highlight. We usually have pizza while we do our club, though that is not mandatory. Reading through all the comments almost always takes far longer than the pizza does to be consumed, and it often ends in a bit of a drag.</p>
<p>In total, we’ve read twenty five books for book club.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Ten of them have been what I would classify as self help books, which is kind of fun, I suppose. Since we’ve now gone through 25 in about five years, I suppose we do each really have an average of a single book per person per year, wow. There’s been one non-fiction, and the rest of the books are all fantasy.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Most recently, we did a marathon of three book clubs back to back to back in a single night. It was really fun, for all that the books were not all universally loved.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Well, c’est la vie. I’m excited for our next book club, whenever it happens.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Another person whose job is actually science outreach sent me their slides. They’re really helpful, so I’ll probably base mine heavily off of his.</p></li>
<li><p>I did a fair amount of cleaning, if only out of necessity.</p></li>
<li><p>Streaks come and go. I don’t regret spending time with my family instead of blogging.</p></li>
<li><p>I ended up with 3/4 chapters last week. Yesterday and today I wrote another, 1/4+</p></li>
<li><p>No poetry since last posting</p></li>
<li><p>No journaling since last post</p></li>
<li><p>Whoops, no stretch</p></li>
<li><p>I have continued making sleep a priority.</p></li>
<li><p>Prayer has once more ceased to be a priority.</p></li>

<li id="fn10" role="doc-endnote"><p>well, we’ve had 25 entries. One of the entries was books 2 through five in a series, and another was six-ten, so I don’t know if that’s really *a* book. One was also two children’s books<a href="#fnref10" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
