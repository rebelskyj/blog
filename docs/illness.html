<p>Sorry for the sudden disappearance, but it’s relevant to the post I promise.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> One thing that’s been a positive from these crazy few years is that I haven’t really gotten sick as much. I feel like I got the flu or something every winter and spring, and I think I’ve maybe gotten sick twice since it began.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I feel like I used to bounce back from illness immediately, and now it takes me a little longer. Maybe it’s the whole “I don’t sleep for 12 hours normally anymore” or “I don’t eat as well anymore”<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, but I got sick over the weekend, and I felt a lot sicker than I feel like I remember I used to normally feel when I was ill. I’m very much on the mend now, but it meant that I didn’t really have the mental or emotional capacity to really do much of anything, especially writing a blog post.</p>
