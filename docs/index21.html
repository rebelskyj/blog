<p>Since I first gave up my blog<a href="#fn001" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, I have started homebrewing.<a href="#fn002" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> One thing that I’ve really enjoyed making, and so have therefore made a few times, is lemon wine. I vaguely follow a <a href="https://skeeterpee.com/recipe">recipe</a>, though I often make it weaker, and I never start with a wine ferment. It tends to end up tasting like lemonade, which is really nice and generally appreciated in the spring and summer months that I’ve made it in the past.</p>
<p>I’ve started a new batch this past weekend, and I’m very excited for it. The fermentation seems to have taken off very well, and I look forward to maybe updating on the results from this as I keep fermenting it.</p>

<h1 id="reflections-on-todays-gospel"><a href="reflections-on-readings-divine-mercy-c-2022.html">Reflections on Today’s Gospel</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 April 24</p>
<p>Acts 5:12 “Many signs and wonders were done among the people at the hands of the apostles.”</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today is Divine Mercy Sunday, the Second Sunday of Easter, and the Eighth and final day of the Octave of Easter. What do each of these mean?</p>
<p>Divine Mercy Sunday was instituted in 2000 by Pope Saint John Paul II. It stems from a devotion that Saint Faustina claimed as part of a private revelation with our Lord and Savior. According to her records, He desired the Sunday following Easter to be in honor of Divine Mercy, and JPII made that happen. As of 2002, there are indulgences, both plenary<a href="#fn011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and partial<a href="#fn012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> associated with the day.</p>
<p>To earn the indulgence, you must<a href="#fn013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> attend Confession, take Eucharist, and pray for the intentions of the Holy Father.<a href="#fn014" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> As with all plenary indulgences, you must be “in a spirit that is completely detached from the affection for a sin, even a venial sin”<a href="#fn015" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. You then must pray in the presence of the Blessed Sacrament the Our Father and the Creed, along with a devout prayer to Jesus. Or, you can take part in a devotion for Divine Mercy. For the partial indulgence, you just need to pray to the merciful Lord “at least with a contrite heart”,</p>
<p>Anyways, moving from what Divine Mercy Sunday is, the Second Sunday in Easter is more or less what it claims to be. Like Lent’s 40<a href="#fn016" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> days, Easter Season is 50. It begins on a Sunday, so each Sunday increments by one until we reach Pentecost.</p>
<p>The final day of the Octave of Easter is similar. Octave means something to do with eight, depending on the context. Liturgically, it means an eight day period. Apparently the “General Norms of the Liturgical Calendar” assign that the first eight days of Easter and Christmas should continue festivities throughout. I had no idea, but now do.</p>
<p>On to the readings. The first reading shows the fact that the Church is alive, even though Christ is no longer in substance and accident present among us. The apostles continue the mission of caring for the poor and helpless.</p>
<p>In the Gospel, we get one of my favorite passages from growing up. St. Thomas did not believe that the Lord had visited the disciples, and famously claimed “Unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands and put my finger into the nailmarks and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.”<a href="#fn017" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> The Lord did not punish him for this, but instead showed Thomas the wounds on his hand and side. Rather than condemn him for his disbelief, the Lord instead calls those of us who were not able to witness it blessed for our belief.</p>
<p>Growing up, I was an inquisitive child. Thomas’ willingness to question the claims of the other Apostles to me always read as something beautiful. Within the Tradition of the Church, we do not hold to beliefs simply because we used to hold to them. Rather, we use Revelation to inform what we believe. Questions are not punished, but rewarded with answers.</p>
<p>That may be a little unclear, let me try again. Thomas did not believe the other disciples. Rather than calling him foolish, or condemning him for his disbelief, the Lord answered Thomas’ question. The consequence of a question asked in good faith is an answer in the Catholic Tradition, and that’s vital.</p>
<p>Equally vital in this reading, though, is the institution of a Sacrament. The disciples are given the power to bind and loose the sins of the world, a power that has been passed down to the priests today. There’s always something beautiful in the Lord’s institution of Sacraments. If I am remembering correctly, the Holy Spirit is always invoked, and there is always a metaphor of breath. Here, “he breathed on them and said to them ‘Receive the holy Spirit. Whose sins you forgive are forgiven them, and whose sins you retain are retained.’”<a href="#fn018" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> I don’t know what about the breath and invocation are striking to me right now, but I will think about it for the week.</p>

<h1 id="novel-update"><a href="novel-updates-5.html">Novel Update</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 April 23</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As I mentioned in my goal for the month, I really wanted to reach 60000 words on the book I’m writing this month. It’s been really interesting doing the writing for it, because each time I sit down to write, it reminds me of what I’m told it’s like to run. The first five to twenty minutes are painful, and I’m watching the seconds count down until I’ve finished the timer. When they run out, though, I find that I’ve suddenly hit a stride, and the words start flowing really easily. I honestly stop wanting to finish writing, which is a nice place to be.</p>
<p>Anyways, as of writing this post I’m at 48177 words, which is less than ideal. That means I’ve written around ten thousand words since the 7th of April, which as I read it seemed like far too slow of a pace. When I look at the time breakdown, though, that is an average of around 20000 words a month, so that’s nice.</p>
<p>I’m at an interesting point in the story. There are a bunch of plot points that I want to get to, but I really don’t want to end the plot points I’m currently writing. Being less vague, the protagonist is currently at home, and will soon be forced to go to magic school. Whenever he ends up at the magic school, the focus of those around him will certainly shift, which will be a fun way to change what I’m writing about. That being said, I really enjoy the part of the book I’m at now, for all that nothing really happens any more.</p>
<p>I recently read a piece of advice that said that if you don’t have the numbers actually perfect for time, make sure to use very vague words for the passage of time so you can’t be wrong. I haven’t been doing that recently, because I had the main character doing actions that were tracked daily. I hope that I managed to make a fairly convincing in-world argument for why he would stop doing them, but fundamentally it doesn’t really matter I guess. No one but one person reads the book right now,<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and he didn’t complain, which means it wasn’t horrible, at least. Anyways, it’s back to writing the novel for me now.</p>

<h1 id="learning-gnuplot"><a href="learning-gnuplot.html">Learning GNUPlot</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 April 21</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As should be fairly unsurprising to most of my readers, in my research I<a href="#fn031" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> need to graph a lot of things. Historically, I’ve graphed in either Excel<a href="#fn032" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> or Python<a href="#fn033" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, but I’m not really happy with either. It’s been suggested to me that I should learn Igor, which I feel notably unhappy about.</p>
<p>“Why”, you might ask, “do you have strong feelings about graphing? More to the point, what strong feelings do you have?” you might continue.</p>
<p>I have strong feelings because I think things should be done well. Python fails for graphing in my opinion because it takes far too long for me to load my data, and I don’t love the way that the graphs look automatically.<a href="#fn034" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Excel is worse on that front, and is awkward to manipulate graphs in. Excel is also bad for a major reason I mislike Igor: neither is FOSS<a href="#fn035" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>If as I scientist I believe that information calls to be shared<a href="#fn036" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>, then I fail to see how I can justify using proprietary software any more than is utterly essential. Now, I admit some amount of hypocrisy here. I do not run on Linux or another FOS operating system, but I try hard to make sure all the software I use is runnable on those systems if possible. And, while I accept that there are circumstances where closed access programs may be essential for research,<a href="#fn037" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> plotting data should not be one of them.</p>
<p>Of course, I also mislike Igor for other reasons, mostly dealing with the complete dearth of help available for it on the internet, its complete lack of user friendliness, and its absolutely baffling choices to be different than every other system I’ve worked with in handling x and y data. Is it powerful? I have to assume so, though I have no intention of learning how.</p>
<p>So, 118 words later, time to finally get to the title of this post. Yesterday I saw a groupmate working on GNUPlot, and realized that it could likely solve a lot of my issues. It’s super fun and easy, if I want to plot sin of x, for instance, I just say “plot sin(x)” and I get a pretty little graph. As I learned fairly quickly, you can make really fun arbitrary graphs, for instance using the commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>set xrange [-1:1]<a href="#fn038" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>plot for [i=1:30] x**i lw i/2</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This plots 30 lines of increasing thickness. Why did I do this, you may ask.</p>
<p>There’s an argument for color where setting the color to -1 results in black. I was curious how many colors there were, so wanted to plot an arbitrary number of lines. Then I quickly got distracted after learning there were 8 and played around more.</p>
<p>Now, that isn’t to say that GNUPlot is without its issues.</p>
<p>One thing that Python and Excel do really well is allow you to edit and manipulate your data. GNUPlot doesn’t support doing that. However, when I need to manipulate my data, I’m probably going to be doing so inside of the spectral fitting software we use,<a href="#fn039" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> rather than in either program, which makes that less of a concern. I still don’t know how to export the graph<a href="#fn0310" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> or plot an existing piece of data, but those both seem simple enough, and the documentation available online is really incredibly useful and prevalent.</p>
<p>So, moving forward I hope to switch over to GNUPlot for my plotting needs.</p>

<h1 id="on-crocheting-continued"><a href="crochet-1.html">On Crocheting Continued</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 April 20</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Crocheting is something I’ve blogged about <a href="crocheting.html">once before</a>. I didn’t talk much about it, which is fair.</p>
<p>The biggest project I’ve ever worked on for crocheting is a blanket that I began in December 2019. I’m currently about 1/3 finished with it, though it’s been at least a calendar year since I’ve worked on it, so I should get back to it.</p>
<p>Currently, I’m in the habit of making hats.<a href="#fn041" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I’ve been averaging one a week for the two and a half weeks I’ve been crocheting them. This week’s hat reminded me that I really prefer to crochet using yarn rated for a larger hook than the one I use, because otherwise the material ends up feeling too flimsy to me. But, I neglected to realize this until I had finished an entire hat, so to make it thicker I’m now going through the entire design backwards and adding another layer of thickness. In many respects, the way I make hats makes this much easier than it otherwise could be.</p>
<p>The way that I crochet hats is by making a circle of 10 double crochet in the round.<a href="#fn042" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> I then, rather than adding a discrete row, just keep crocheting onto the first stitch again, making a spiral. In the second “row”, I put 20 stitches in. There are 30 in the third and so on until I get to the 70 stitches that’s been working for me lately. I should mention that I crochet into the back loop only, which adds a pretty spiral pattern into the hat. This also worked well for me working backwards, because it gives me an easy place to crochet into. Anyways, once I’ve reached the 70 stitches, I just keep going in the spiral without adding stitches until the hat gets long enough.</p>
<p>For this hat, I ended the string, because I thought I wanted to crochet from the top down again. However, upon consideration, it appears that bottom up works better for the second layer, so I could have saved two ends by just going backwards from the bottom.</p>
<p>As I should say more often, c’est la vie.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I feel like I used to bounce back from illness immediately, and now it takes me a little longer.

<p>First Published: 2022 April 15</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Despite my claims about needing a while to adequately learn the telestich, I’m happy enough with the speed I wrote yesterday’s that I’m going to move on to the double acrostic. I feel like this is going to be really hard because the way that I had to modify my word choices was very different in the two single acrostic forms. But, you know what they say: nothing ventured, nothing gained.</p>
<p>Attempt<br />
Attend to the pleasant aroma<br />
That wafts from an effort since past<br />
Take heed of the slow-moving draft<br />
Each time that it comes to your side<br />
Meet the day with outward calm<br />
Pass times until all used up<br />
Together with every attempt<br />
So not the best poem I’ve ever written, but I think it’s not horrible for a stream of conscious writing. According to the book of forms, the poem’s content should center around the word being built. I don’t know if I’ve done a particularly good job with that today, but there’s always tomorrow.</p>

<p>As I mentioned <a href="poetry-forms-1.html">last time</a>, I’m writing through a book of poetic forms. I wrote my first telestich, and it’s a much different experience than writing a typical acrostic. I can think of lots of words that start with almost any letter of the alphabet, but very few words ending in certain letters. The first poem I worked on was based on “church”, which meant I needed two c-ended words and a u-ended word. It took a lot of searching for both, so I think that to make a good telestich the word choice is far more important than in an acrostic. Future poems will hopefully go better as I figure out good words. Below is today’s poem, rough as it is.</p>

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As I mentioned <a href="reflection-march-2022.html">yesterday</a>, I’m writing through a book of poetic forms. The first of these forms listed is the acrostic. There are apparently four kinds of acrostic:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>normal acrostic: the first letters of each line spell out a word, with stanzas forming the spaces</p></li>
<li><p>telestich: the last letter of each line spell out a word, otherwise the same</p></li>
<li><p>double acrostic: acrostic+telestich, but using the same words, I assume, because</p></li>
<li><p>coumpound acrostic: spells a different word in the first and last letters</p></li>
</ol>
<p>According to the book, acrostics tend to have meter and rhyme, but it specifies nothing further, which kind of makes sense. Any other restrictions added probably just make it an acrostic and a rhyme or what not.</p>
<p>Yesterday I wrote a standard acrostic, which went easily enough. Since my goal is proficiency<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> in the different forms, I think the single one was enough. Today is going to be a telestich, and hopefully that goes well as well.</p>

<li><p>Listen to BiaY Daily. I like making progress on it.</p></li>
<li><p>Reach 50000 words in my book. I’m currently at more than 20K, so this should be very doable.</p></li>

<p>I accomplished none of these.</p>
<p>I blogged for about half of March, before I gave it up. I don’t think I wrote poetry more than a few times in March. I stopped the pushups almost immediately. I did not listen to BiaY. I got to approximately 40000 words, which is fun, because it means that a sustainable pace is apparently 20K words a month, though I guess it’s always possible to draw a line with two data points.</p>
<p>My goals for April are:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Blog daily (starting now). I think that the reflection it makes me do is really useful. I do think that I need to find a better way to ensure that I have time for it, though.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a poem a day. I just bought a book of poetic forms, so it would be good to start working through them.<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Stretch daily. I tried to stretch this morning and was shocked at how inflexible I am.</p></li>
<li><p>Listen to BiaY daily. I really don’t like how far behind I am, and I’d like to catch up sooner than later.</p></li>
<li><p>Reach 60K words in the book. If past months are indicative, that’s a goal I can accomplish. I think I may need to do some more planning, rather than writing by the seat of my pants, because I’m starting to get into a bit of a rut in terms of writing. Maybe it’s just that I have continued this section of the book for far too long.<a href="#fn092" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>A secondary goal for the book is to write every day, even if only a few words. I think it’s good to develop good habits, though I guess I should think about balancing doing something because I enjoy it with getting work done. That’s another thing to think about I suppose.</p></li>
<li><p>Practice guitar every day. I like the sound of guitar, and I would love to be able to play longer without my fingers hurting.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I hope these are plausible goals, though only time can say for certain. I know that I <em>am</em> about to write the poem, so that’s at least four things off the list today.<a href="#fn093" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Hopefully I can make it through all six tasks each day, especially since most of them are so short.</p>
