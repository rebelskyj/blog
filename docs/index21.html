<p>My first 56 hours of life in London have passed me by, so it felt like a good time to get some reflections out of the way. Since I’ve never lived anywhere but Grinnell, I thought I’d be a little more culture shocked than I was. To be honest, London feels a lot like Grinnell so far. Or at least, London feels a lot like Grinnell during NSO. <a href="#fn001" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I don’t recognize most of the people, and everyone is rushing somewhere. It might help that I’m in a part of London that’s fairly old, so the buildings aren’t towering over me.</p>
<p>Some big takeaways from my first 56 hours:<br />
1. Apparently when I don’t have a 24/7 access to Google Maps and the internet, I actually have pretty good navigation.<br />
2. It takes around 30 minutes to walk around King’s Cross Station if you find yourself in that situation.<br />
3. Apparently bagpipes aren’t all that common here. In Grinnell I’m surprised if a week goes by where I don’t hear bagpipes, but so far I’ve heard and seen none.<br />
4. London weather is much nicer than Grinnell’s.<a href="#fn002" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> When I walk out in the morning it’s almost, but not quite, too cold for my shirt and slacks. By 1700 <a href="#fn003" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, it’s heated up to what feels like the peak of the day, and it’s only slightly uncomfortable to powerwalk through the streets.<br />
5. It’s a lot harder to find a Catholic church in London than in America. I’ve so far seen a few Church of England churches, a Baptist church, an Ethiopian Reformed Church, and a Christian Scientist gathering place. Looking at Google Maps, however, I think I should be able to find one.<br />
6. The underground is really simple to navigate. I’m still not sure how the busses work though.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!<br />

<h1 id="hello-world"><a href="hello-world.html">Hello World!</a></h1>
<p>“Hello World!” is one of the first <a href="#fn011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> pieces of code that I <a href="#fn012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> learn to code when learning a new language. There are a variety of reasons for this, none of which I am aware of. However, it’s still a great way to start this blog.<br />
Speaking of starting, I’m starting this blog for three major reasons <a href="#fn013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>:<br />
1. Someone asked me if I would be sending email updates about my time abroad <br />
2. I like having a forced place to write <br />
3. As my tagline notes, my father also writes <a href="#fn014" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> daily essays. <br />
So, expect to see some updates about travel, my life abroad, and whatever else happens to be on my mind when I sit down to write.</p>
