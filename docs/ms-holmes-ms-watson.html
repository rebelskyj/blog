<p>First Published: 2023 August 24</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>A few weeks ago now<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I did something that I haven’t done in a while.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> I went to go see a play. The university I attend<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> was putting on a production of Ms. Holmes and Ms. Watson.</p>
<p>Now, if you’re anything like me, then your first instinct will be to complain that it’s “Ms.” Watson, not “Dr.” Watson.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> I had that complaint going in, especially since the play was described as a feminist retelling.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> I had<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> recently subscribed to a SubStack<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> called “Letters from Watson,” which just sends out serialized versions of the Sherlock Holmes short stories. It’s really interesting reading them, especially as someone who reads<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> a fair amount of modern serialized fiction. The genre conventions have certainly shifted in the intervening years. However, since this post is a review of the show, rather than the fiction, I digress.</p>
<p>When I arrived, the play promised many of the common staples of modern small work plays. It said that there would be forced audience participation<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> and that it was a loving but disrespectful<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> retelling of Arthur Conan Doyle’s work. It was fine.</p>
<p>I’m not sure whether I was just hungry and so not as into the play as normal, but the play lacked a lot of flow to me. When I go to a play that I really enjoy, at least for a moment I forget that what I am watching is a play. At no point during the show did I forget that I was sitting in a crowd, watching a performance. I suppose the fourth wall breaks did add to that feeling.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Still, it was an enjoyable show, and I would happily see it again.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>One of my research group mates is also planning to learn how to use Blender, so now I have an accountability buddy for it. I also think it might be worth finding some set of online tutorials and starting them sooner than later.</p></li>
<li><p>It is beyond hot, which meant that I have been trying to minimize moving as much as possible.</p>
<p>As a direct result, that means that I was not making those big strides.</p></li>
<li><p>I’m now four for four<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> posts, for all that I did not remember to post the actual post from yesterday until this morning. I suppose that there’s not much of a way for future readers to see that, though if you were on the post last night, I apologize.</p></li>
<li><p>As a direct result of thinking about math and coding for my entire day yesterday, I did not write too much. According to my logs, I wrote a little under four hundred words of Jeb today. I need to write more, since I’m currently typing tomorrow’s chapter. I’m not sure where I’m trying to go with the story at this exact moment, which I think is part of the issue. My nominal plans for the book say that the next 85 chapters will cover a few<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> amount of years in the character’s life. I suppose that sitting and blocking out what I want to happen could be a good idea.</p>
<p>2.3/4+</p></li>
<li><p>Last night I left my laptop at work. Probably as a direct result, I wrote an entire song!<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I did not journal. That’s probably fine.</p></li>
<li><p>I forgot to stretch this morning. Or, equally fairly, it was very hot and I wanted to not do anything.</p></li>
<li><p>I fell asleep at a normal time last night, which was nice. I also woke up before my goal of 6 am today, which was absolutely fantastic.</p></li>
<li><p>I prayed a rosary last night before bed and then listened along to a rosary podcast that a friend recommended on my commute to work today.</p></li>

<li id="fn1" role="doc-endnote"><p>because wow it turns out that one reason I might stop posting is because I become suddenly busy<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2" role="doc-endnote"><p>though, given the infinite number of potential permutations of activities I can do, that’s not the most meaningful statement.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3" role="doc-endnote"><p>which is such an awkward construction<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4" role="doc-endnote"><p>of course, that’s presupposing a lot about the (allegedly extant) readership of my blog, I suppose<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn11" role="doc-endnote"><p>this is not the place for me to go into a rant about the way that I dislike modern (popular) media’s tendency (tendencies? media is technically inherently plural) to avoid any sort of genuine emotional appeal by hiding it behind sarcasm and smarm. There will be a place for it sometime soon, but not today<a href="#fnref11" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn12" role="doc-endnote"><p>which is shockingly hard for me to type. I had to erase four four four at least once (and then again when trying to type what my mistake was, I put for in the wrong place as well<a href="#fnref12" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
