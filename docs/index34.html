<p>I just finished a read through<a href="#fn001" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> of the blog on here. It’s really interesting to see a glimpse into my life three-ish years ago. I noticed a couple of major things. First, it’s really fun to me that I’ve basically just caught back up to the point in the liturgical season we’re at because readings loop every three years. Second, seeing my public<a href="#fn002" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> comments on different portions of my life let me remember some of the parts of my days I didn’t write which is fantastic.</p>
<p>Since my <a href="ending-18.html">last</a> end of/beginning of year post had five things I was most grateful for and the same number things I was looking forward to, in 2021<a href="#fn003" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> I was most grateful for<a href="#fn004" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Meeting fantastic people, including a special person in my life</p></li>
<li><p><a href="/scores/Ave%20Maris%20Stella%20Arti.pdf">Composing</a> again (for the first time since graduating)</p></li>
<li><p>Really learning about my research<a href="#fn005" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Got vaccinated!</p></li>
<li><p>Presented at my first conference as a graduate student!</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Five things that I’m looking forward to<a href="#fn006" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> in 2022 are<a href="#fn007" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Passing my Thesis Background Exam</p></li>
<li><p>Growing deeper in my relationships</p></li>
<li><p>Continuing this blog again<a href="#fn008" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Taking a class on the interstellar medium<a href="#fn009" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Growing more independent in my research</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Going into 2019, I never could have predicted what fantastic things would happen,<a href="#fn0010" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> though all five of the events I was hoping for<a href="#fn0011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> happened and were wonderful, so I can only assume the same will be true in 2022.</p>
<p>Anyways, since this blog more or less exists nowhere visible anymore, this may be functionally a virtual diary. I’m excited for it nonetheless.</p>
<p>Posts I’m planning<a href="#fn0012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Talking about writing villanelles</p></li>
<li><p>Writing about good books I have read/am reading</p></li>
<li><p>Studying for the Patent Bar<a href="#fn0013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Anyways, happy 2022!</p>

<p>It’s been a little under three years since the last time I wrote on here. It seems like it might be a good time to restart for a variety of reasons, which may be elaborated on further. This post is very short because my goal is relearning how to update my blog</p>

<p>As each month slowly passes by, I find that I will think in rhymes and rhythms that obey the poems I should ink. And so today I thought I’d try to write a post like that. But wow, it’s hard conveying thoughts when each beat has a place.</p>

<p>Jeremiah 17:7: “ Blessed are those who trust in the LORD; the LORD will be their trust”</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today’s readings speak about trusting the Lord, for better and for worse. Should we trust in the Lord, we are told that we will be cared for in times of sorrow. However, we are also told that those times of sorrow will come If we are weeping now, laughter will come to us.<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> If we are laughing now, however, we will weep later.<a href="#fn062" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Now, this isn’t to say that we should be in a perpetual state of weeping, with hopes that our joy will come later.<a href="#fn063" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Rather, we are to remember that the good in our lives will comes to an end, just as the bad will.</p>
