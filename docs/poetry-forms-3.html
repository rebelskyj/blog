<p>Despite my claims about needing a while to adequately learn the telestich, I’m happy enough with the speed I wrote yesterday’s that I’m going to move on to the double acrostic. I feel like this is going to be really hard because the way that I had to modify my word choices was very different in the two single acrostic forms. But, you know what they say: nothing ventured, nothing gained.</p>
<p>Attempt<br />
Attend to the pleasant aroma<br />
That wafts from an effort since past<br />
Take heed of the slow-moving draft<br />
Each time that it comes to your side<br />
Meet the day with outward calm<br />
Pass times until all used up<br />
Together with every attempt<br />
So not the best poem I’ve ever written, but I think it’s not horrible for a stream of conscious writing. According to the book of forms, the poem’s content should center around the word being built. I don’t know if I’ve done a particularly good job with that today, but there’s always tomorrow.</p>
