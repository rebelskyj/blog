<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Wow one month <a href="writing-5.html">to the day</a> since my last post on writing. I guess I should look at what I thought then, before entering into what I wanted to write about.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>I still use Stimuwrite for my writing, and it remains a really good motivator. It’s somehow good enough that it’s kept me going this whole summer. I am absolutely more efficient with it now, because the numbers going up give me dopamine rushes, which are really nice.</p>
<p>I am still absolutely atrocious at writing poetry.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> I should figure out why that is. I’m sure that it has something to do with my lack of schedule anymore, but that’s just an idea.</p>
<p>I have continued writing letters to friends, which has been great.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> I’ve stopped counting those words in my word goals, which feels healthy.</p>
<p>I also have absolutely not been journaling in the slightest. I don’t really think that’s an issue, though, because I haven’t felt particularly disconnected from myself lately. I think the grounding of writing to friends helps a lot.</p>
<p>Interestingly, every sentence in this musing, other than the first, begins with the letter “I”, and almost all of them are the word. I guess it is a self reflection, so that makes some amount of sense.</p>
<p>Anyways, on to the real content of this musing. I recently got a fountain pen, and have been using it for the analog writing I do. It’s an interesting transition, for a few reasons.</p>
<p>First, it’s a little thicker than the utensils i’ve been using lately. Despite being labeled as ultrafine, it’s still about thirty percent wider than the nibs I’m used to. It’s also a lot heavier than my pencils and pens, which is a welcome change, though one that takes some adjustment. Getting ink to run has been a little more difficult than expected, though I’m hopeful that will change in the future. All in all, I’m very excited to see what comes of my new writing implement.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>I cleaned a fair amount today, though that was mainly because it was necessary to clean space in order to move the things I needed to move. I also washed some objects that had an indeterminate need to be washed, though since I plan on using them soon, it’s likely good that they’re clean now.</p></li>
<li><p>I am about to write a chapter, which I began this morning.</p></li>
<li><p>My <a href="conference-2.html">last musing’s</a> Tuesday next has come and past, and I have not made time for exercise. I guess that’s something I need to start slotting back in.</p></li>
<li><p>I woke up at six and immediately returned to sleep, which is a choice.</p></li>
<li><p>I have been listening to CCCiaY, though not today. Prayer has been slipping again, so I should probably try to pray tonight before bed.</p></li>
<li><p>Today’s chapter came up on time, and I need to write Friday’s now. I did write the first few hundred words of it for today’s chapter, before realizing it was best served as a cliffhanger.</p></li>
<li><p>Once more, today will be a day without poetry.</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote and gave a letter today. The friend appreciated it, and I heard that another letter was delivered, and yet another was appreciated as well. I also addressed around five new ones since my last posting, which means the pile is in no risk of emptying.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
