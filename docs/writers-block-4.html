<p>It’s really interesting where I do and don’t get writer’s block. In the exams I need to write for my program, I get them constantly. In the novel I’m writing for fun but also have committed to in some respects, I get it occasionally. In this blog, which I’ve done for longer, I get it often. And, in the random short story prompt I was given and inspired to create a tumblr for, I apparently don’t have it. Weird.</p>
<p>Anyways, writer’s block is such a weird concept when you stop to think about it. There are infinite ways that I can combine letters to create meaning, and infinitely many ways to make nonsense. But, when I have writer’s block, I can’t even think of a way to write nonsense. It’s really fun to think about.</p>
<p>That also, as I read it, may be a good solution to writer’s block. Just keyboard mash until you see a word and hope it sparks something. If I get this again, I may try it.</p>
