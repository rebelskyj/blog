<p>First Published: 2023 September 3</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>And, like sand through an hourglass, my own hours have passed silently by. Whoops, that’s a little maudlin. Let’s try opening again.</p>
<p>Like the moon which rises and falls each day, waxing and waning over the course of a month, my own month was filled with intermediate highs and lows.<a href="#fn001" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>August, like a summer’s day, felt so long in the moment and yet so short upon reflection.<a href="#fn002" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> I gave my <a href="universe-4.html">last</a> few<a href="#fn003" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> talks for the summer! I went to a concert!<a href="#fn004" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> I <a href="ms-holmes-ms-watson.hmtl">went to a play!</a></p>
<p>I turned <a href="twenty-five">twenty five</a>! I gave my accordion away to be repaired. I competed in a pinball tournament! I went to a friend’s thesis defense!</p>
<p>I wrote a few letters. I swam in a Great Lake!<a href="#fn005" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> I visited my family!</p>
<p>Ok, so in retrospect, I suppose that I did actually do a lot. It still doesn’t feel like it, but as they<a href="#fn006" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> say, c’est la vie.</p>
<p>Let’s see how that list compares with what I said I was excited for.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>My birthday! Hey nice I did say that.</p></li>
<li><p>Giving five talks in state parks. I at least alluded to this!</p></li>
<li><p>Sharing lemon wine with friends I did! I didn’t think it was notable, though, but I suppose that it was. Once again, generally positive reviews<a href="#fn007" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Finishing my stack of letters. I also had a passive aggressive comment about getting a letter back. I not only finished the stack, I got three!<a href="#fn008" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> letters back.</p></li>
<li><p>Starting to do open mics regularly again I think I did one or two. I don’t know if I’m in an open mic frame of mind anymore. Maybe it will come back to my life again at some point, but it certainly isn’t there now.</p></li>
<li><p>Staying up on all of my book clubs. I dropped one book club, and otherwise I think I did manage to do that.</p></li>
<li><p>Making progress on research. I did! My instrument makes plasma now, and my computational project got approved as a real thing I can devote actual energy to.<a href="#fn009" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Monetizing my story? I did not, though I did just get a review of my book that explicitly asked me to, so I guess that gets to go on this month’s?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at last month’s goals:<a href="#fn0010" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Finish my presentation on the Pleiades. Hey nice! I did it.</p></li>
<li><p>Make my home clean again. I made progress, which is like a success.</p></li>
<li><p>Blog more. Ummm, let me check. I blogged three more times!<a href="#fn0011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Stretch daily. I stretched seven times. That is much less than daily, especially since I know that at least two of them happened in the same day.</p></li>
<li><p>Sleep enough and have a sleep schedule based around waking up no later than 6. I think I did more of the former and less of the latter. I guess I don’t even know if that’s true, upon thinking. I don’t wake up to alarms, but I don’t feel well rested. Maybe I need more vitamin D.</p></li>
<li><p>Be more intentional about prayer. Oops! This is becoming a perennial goal that I never reach. Maybe this month!</p></li>
<li><p>Get further ahead on the book. In particular, I’d like to set the goal of more than four chapters a week. Well, I did not do that at all. I fell slightly behind, I think, because I was a little ahead at the start of the month and ended exactly at cue. As you might expect from the lack of blogging during a two week period, there was minimal writing of the book going on then.</p></li>
<li><p>Write poetry every day. I wrote some poetry, though not much at all.</p></li>
<li><p>Finish stack of letters, and maybe think of more people to write to? Otherwise, start journaling during my morning time? I finished the stack, though I didn’t think of anyone new, and I did not start writing in a journal. I did use my blog much more as a journal, though, so I suppose that kind of counts, right?</p></li>
<li><p>Write a song. Wow! A goal that I reached with no qualifiers. Not only did I write a whole song, but I even have vocal drafts<a href="#fn0012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> of a few more songs.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Things that I’m excited for this month:<a href="#fn0013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Running more than five miles again!<a href="#fn0014" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Swimming with friends!<a href="#fn0015" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Giving my final talk in the parks for the season<a href="#fn0016" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> Coincidentally, this is also the final of the talk series for any speaker.</p></li>
<li><p>Recording a song!</p></li>
<li><p>Being ready for my upcoming talks.</p></li>
<li><p>Maybe<a href="#fn0017" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> give or at least hash out details for me to give my first invited talk at a college I do not attend.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Using last month’s goals, things I am excited about,<a href="#fn0018" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>, and my goals for this year of life as inspiration, this month’s goals:<a href="#fn0019" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Finish/make my talk on the eclipses. I have a lot of ideas, and I need to bang my head against the wall of learning how to animate until that wall breaks or I lose the motivation to do anything.</p></li>
<li><p>Make my home clean again. Listen, if I have the goal long enough, it might set in finally.</p></li>
<li><p>Blog more! I’m off to a terrible start, given that I’m writing this reflection on the third, but.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch and exercise more. I know that it is incredibly important to my mental health that I remain physically active.<a href="#fn0020" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> I also know that I hate how inflexible I am generally, and especially how inflexible I am now.</p></li>
<li><p>As before, sleep enough, and try to prioritize sleeping earlier. I know that my best sleep happens earlier in the night. I might try experimenting with biphasic sleeping<a href="#fn0021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> since I seem to remember that working for me at some point in my life.</p></li>
<li><p>As always, be more intentional about prayer. Once more off to a bad start, but I really do feel better when I do. I think that spending at least fifteen minutes in the chapel each day<a href="#fn0022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> is not an unreasonable goal. There isn’t anything that I need to do that I can’t push fifteen minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>Actually get ahead on my book. I would like to be five chapters ahead and to have plotted out the rest of this arc.<a href="#fn0023" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Write more poetry. Daily may not be realistic, especially since I haven’t written much this month.</p></li>
<li><p>Write or record a song. I have the year’s goal of recording an album. If there are twelve songs on my album<a href="#fn0024" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>, I need to record on average a little more than a song a month<a href="#fn0025" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>. I also want to do almost exclusively, if not actually exclusively, originals on my album.<a href="#fn0026" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Write five<a href="#fn0027" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> things I like about myself every day<a href="#fn0028" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>, three things I’m excited for, and ten things I’m grateful for. I keep seeing things about cultivating positivity, and I really need to do that right now.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Given these goals, the questions that I will need to answer each day:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I make progress on my eclipse talk(s)?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I fight against the entropy in my living space?</p></li>
<li><p>Have I been better about blogging?<a href="#fn0029" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I exercise?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I prioritize sleep?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I wake as early as I’d hoped?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I spend fifteen minutes in the chapel?</p></li>
<li><p>Am I writing more than the bare minimum for my book?</p></li>
<li><p>Am I making net progress on plotting my book?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write poetry?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I work on my album?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write five things I like about myself?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write three things I’m excited for?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write ten things I’m grateful for?</p></li>
<li><p>Generally, did I cultivate joy?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>And, as a day in September<a href="#fn0030" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a>, today’s responses:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I did not make progress in my talks, though last night I did realize how badly I explain them without props or images, which is like progress.</p></li>
<li><p>I have not, and may or may not today, honestly.</p></li>
<li><p>I mean, at the current rate of 1/3 days, no. I will not exceed 11 posts this month.</p></li>
<li><p>I’ll stretch after this post.</p></li>
<li><p>I swam with friends!!</p></li>
<li><p>Oof. I mean, in my defense, I forgot an eye mask and was camping. In my offense<a href="#fn0031" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a>, I could’ve remembered that or taken a nap at any point today.</p></li>
<li><p>I woke up a few times<a href="#fn0032" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a>, and got up around six thirty I think. That feels fine.</p></li>
<li><p>I’ll go and do so after stretching/before I go to Mass tonight.</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote a chapter, which is arguably more. I’ll try to at least plot out my goal for the next chapter<a href="#fn0033" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I mean, in the sense that I plotted four points to hit in the last chapter and hit one, yes.</p></li>
<li><p>No poetry. I’ll see how I feel tonight.</p></li>
<li><p>I realized on the drive last night that at least one song needs to have a really driving piano beat.<a href="#fn0034" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> and I thought about what I might want, so kind of.</p></li>
<li><p>I typed, because I forgot my pen outside of my home and it’s not worth getting up to go get it right now.</p></li>
<li><p>Apparently ibid does not, in fact, like I always thought, mean “see above.” It instead means previous citation. I’ll keep using it my way, though since it works. Anyways, that’s a long winded way of saying ibid.</p></li>
<li><p>ibid.</p></li>
<li><p>I don’t know; I think I tried, at least a little.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Oof, that was a bit of a marathon post. Sorry.</p>

<h1 id="family-board-games"><a href="board-game-night.html">Family Board Games</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 August 30</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Last night my family had our first<a href="#fn011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> board game night. It was a really fun time, for all that it was much shorter than our historic marathon nights. We checked that we were able to play two games,<a href="#fn012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> and we played through one of them.</p>
<p>Playing Ticket to Ride virtually is a much different experience than playing it live. Thankfully, it is not a game that has significant intrigue, and so the fact that I was playing with the rest of my family from behind a screen didn’t make too much of a difference. It was also really nice to not have to carefully place each of the incredibly small plastic trains on the page. The game layout also makes it incredibly clear how much of the game is left.<a href="#fn013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>One interesting feature that the game offered is that, like some variations of chess, each player only has so much time to make every choice they will over the course of the game. I chose forty<a href="#fn014" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> five minutes per player, because that was the default for the game, and I didn’t know what changing it would do. I am now curious what would happen if you ran out of time, though. Would it skip your turn? Make you queue your move? I should try it sometime.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>No work on presentations. I might try to spend some time tomorrow or this weekend on it.</p></li>
<li><p>I cleaned even more minimally. I want to try kegging instead of using a secondary for my next batch of lemon wine, though, which means I need to clean soon.</p></li>
<li><p>Writing my blog continues to go well.</p></li>
<li><p>I finished up the next chapter today and plotted out the next chapter. I should really plot out the book a little more than what I’m doing, which is sentences at a time for the future books, five total sentences for this book, and ideas for exactly the next chapter. 2/4+</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote no poetry yesterday. Sadly.</p></li>
<li><p>I posted the letter, which is progress. I did not write, though.</p></li>
<li><p>Maybe stretching was a bad goal.</p></li>
<li><p>Less trouble falling asleep, though I still felt the need to sleep in. Unlike yesterday, I feel very comfortable with that choice.</p></li>
<li><p>I really need to get back into the swing of praying. I haven’t, and I regret it.</p></li>

<h1 id="talk-planning-redux"><a href="talk-planning-redux-1.html">Talk Planning, Redux</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 August 29</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p><a href="talk-planning-1">Last</a> <a href="talk-planning-2">year</a> <a href="talk-planning-3">I</a> gave a talk that was in part about tuning theory. Unsurprisingly, especially given the fact I had been thinking about that talk for years beforehand, I am not entirely happy with the talk that I gave. Mostly, I think that’s because I fell into the same trap that everyone does. Namely: it’s easy to explain how 3 to the n is never equal to 2 to the m<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, which means any system is inherently flawed.</p>
<p>As I keep thinking, though, there are other elements I could touch as well. After all, if you only want two notes, you can have a perfectly tuned scale with C and G.<a href="#fn022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> If you want three notes, then you can even have a well tuned one with C, F, and G.<a href="#fn023" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The first issue, I suppose, comes between using three and five limit tuning. Now, for those who don’t already know,<a href="#fn024" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> limit tuning refers to the largest prime factor you can have in the denominator or numerator. Going through in order:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>One limit tuning: you can play a single note. Arguably, since it’s a single note, it is definitionally in tune</p></li>
<li><p>Two limit tuning: you can play octaves! Wow, harmony!<a href="#fn025" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Three limit tuning: you now get the fifth. Stacking two fifths<a href="#fn026" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> gives you a major second. Stacking three gives you a minor third, and so on until you build the twelve tone scale. Notably, it takes 7 fifths to build a diatonic scale, assuming you start from the correct note.<a href="#fn027" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> That works, but it gives you really wonky thirds, because</p></li>
<li><p>Five limit tuning<a href="#fn028" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>: adds the major and by extension minor third. When building up the ratios, 1 to 2 is an octave, 2 to 3 is a fifth, 3 to 4 is a fourth<a href="#fn029" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>, 4 to 5 is a major third, 5 to 6 is a minor third.<a href="#fn0210" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> The third in 3 limit tuning is<a href="#fn0211" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> 81:64, which is not quite the same. From this, you only need F, C, and G to produce a diatonic scale! Wow, progress</p></li>
<li><p>Seven limit tuning introduces the harmonic seventh. For those who haven’t heard of that, that’s because we don’t really use it in western music.<a href="#fn0212" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Since the harmonic seventh of C lies more or less equidistant between B flat and B,<a href="#fn0213" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> there isn’t much of a use for it, and by extension, any further limit in western tuning.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Ok how did I get here? Right, how tuning theory is broken for multiple reasons. I think that a five limit diatonic scale should work perfectly, assuming you only want to play in one key. I have an inclination that it would break down even as fast as adding the dominant or subdominant keys.<a href="#fn0214" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> Yeah it breaks down immediately.</p>
<p>Ok I know that I’ve done other prep work for the talk, but my notes are all very far away, and getting to them feels like a lot of effort with minimal payoff. Anyways, all this to say, the new talk on tuning theory will go deeper into the math than my last one did, even if I never give it to a single real person.</p>

<li id="fn025" role="doc-endnote"><p>ok so actually, there’s a concept for consonance and dissonance where it’s how far the notes are harmonically (I mean duh, but my words aren’t working, hence why I’m doing talk planning). The most consonant interval is obviously the octave (since unison isn’t really an interval), and it has a distance of one. A fifth has a distance of two, as does two octaves. I think that matches my experience well, though I need to find the source paper so I can read it (I think I saw it in a 12tone video at some point). From a quick google, it seems like they might be doing log of the least common multiple of the two notes. In that case, once again, there is no way to make a fifth and octaves be the same harmonic distance. At a first order, though, a fifth (2:3) would be six as LCM, and so lies between two and three octaves in terms of dissonance. Ok enough diversion, back to the actual text<a href="#fn02ref5" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn026" role="doc-endnote"><p>for this and everything, assume that I still believe in octave equivalence (for all that I’m more and more intellectually willing to not)<a href="#fn02ref6" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn027" role="doc-endnote"><p>in this case, building from the fourth (fa, or F (hmmmm I wonder if there’s something to the fact that the fourth (f) is fa (f) and the note f (f). eh probably nothing new)<a href="#fn02ref7" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn028" role="doc-endnote"><p>remember, it’s primes, so four adds nothing new<a href="#fn02ref8" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn029" role="doc-endnote"><p>because we define a fifth and a fourth to be an octave, and 2 to four is absolutely an octave<a href="#fn02ref9" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0210" role="doc-endnote"><p>because we define a major and a minor third to be a fifth, and four to six is a fifth<a href="#fn02ref10" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0211" role="doc-endnote"><p>ok some quick math: 3/2 is G, 3/2 times 3/2 is 9/8 (octave equiv) is D, 3/2 more is 27/16 is A, 81/64 is E. 1.265<a href="#fn02ref11" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0212" role="doc-endnote"><p>though there are a lot of arguments that the blues and jazz use it, since they use something known as a blue note, which is halfway between a major and minor third, like this is<a href="#fn02ref12" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0213" role="doc-endnote"><p>968 cents, according to wikipedia (and no, I will not be getting into what a cent is right now, because I don’t care that much)<a href="#fn02ref13" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0214" role="doc-endnote"><p>but I should really work out the math. Let’s see, we get A from F and then A from D if we do dominant. A from D would be 27/16, whereas A from F is 4/3 for F and then the fifth is 4 to 5 so 15/8. Nope, 5/3 actually. That makes more sense. 1.6875 is not quite 1.6 repeating, though they are shockingly close. I suppose that playing the two together could work. I also suppose taking the harmonic (i think that’s the right word, the log based one) average of the two could work<a href="#fn02ref14" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Apparently I’ve never written about my family’s book club.<a href="#fn031" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> That doesn’t necessarily mean that I haven’t but I can’t find it, so it doesn’t count right now.</p>
<p>So, what is the family book club?<a href="#fn032" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Well, you need to come with me back to the far off time of 2018?<a href="#fn033" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> My father messaged one of our family group chats<a href="#fn034" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> about a book he thought we should all read.<a href="#fn035" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> I<a href="#fn036" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> then replied that we should have a family book club. The rest of my family agreed, and so we have all taken turns<a href="#fn037" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> choosing a book for us all to read.</p>
<p>Each book club begins with a few standard questions.<a href="#fn038" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>We all give a thumbs up, down, or to the side for whether we enjoyed the book or not. The one who chose the book says why they picked it. We all give our big picture opinions on the book.</p>
<p>Then, because we exclusively read digitally, we go through the ebook that we have all annotated<a href="#fn039" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> and read through each comment and highlight. We usually have pizza while we do our club, though that is not mandatory. Reading through all the comments almost always takes far longer than the pizza does to be consumed, and it often ends in a bit of a drag.</p>
<p>In total, we’ve read twenty five books for book club.<a href="#fn0310" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Ten of them have been what I would classify as self help books, which is kind of fun, I suppose. Since we’ve now gone through 25 in about five years, I suppose we do each really have an average of a single book per person per year, wow. There’s been one non-fiction, and the rest of the books are all fantasy.<a href="#fn0311" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>Most recently, we did a marathon of three book clubs back to back to back in a single night. It was really fun, for all that the books were not all universally loved.<a href="#fn0312" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Well, c’est la vie.

<h1 id="ms.-holmes-and-ms.-watson-review"><a href="ms-holmes-ms-watson.html">Ms. Holmes and Ms. Watson Review</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 August 24</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>A few weeks ago now<a href="#fn041" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I did something that I haven’t done in a while.<a href="#fn042" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> I went to go see a play. The university I attend<a href="#fn043" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> was putting on a production of Ms. Holmes and Ms. Watson.</p>
<p>Now, if you’re anything like me, then your first instinct will be to complain that it’s “Ms.” Watson, not “Dr.” Watson.<a href="#fn044" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> I had that complaint going in, especially since the play was described as a feminist retelling.<a href="#fn045" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> I had<a href="#fn046" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> recently subscribed to a SubStack<a href="#fn047" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> called “Letters from Watson,” which just sends out serialized versions of the Sherlock Holmes short stories. It’s really interesting reading them, especially as someone who reads<a href="#fn048" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> a fair amount of modern serialized fiction. The genre conventions have certainly shifted in the intervening years. However, since this post is a review of the show, rather than the fiction, I digress.</p>
<p>When I arrived, the play promised many of the common staples of modern small work plays. It said that there would be forced audience participation<a href="#fn049" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> and that it was a loving but disrespectful<a href="#fn0410" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> retelling of Arthur Conan Doyle’s work. It was fine.</p>
<p>I’m not sure whether I was just hungry and so not as into the play as normal, but the play lacked a lot of flow to me. When I go to a play that I really enjoy, at least for a moment I forget that what I am watching is a play. At no point during the show did I forget that I was sitting in a crowd, watching a performance. I suppose the fourth wall breaks did add to that feeling.<a href="#fn0411" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Still, it was an enjoyable show, and I would happily see it again.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>One of my research group mates is also planning to learn how to use Blender, so now I have an accountability buddy for it. I also think it might be worth finding some set of online tutorials and starting them sooner than later.</p></li>
<li><p>It is beyond hot, which meant that I have been trying to minimize moving as much as possible.</p>
<p>As a direct result, that means that I was not making those big strides.</p></li>
<li><p>I’m now four for four<a href="#fn0412" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> posts, for all that I did not remember to post the actual post from yesterday until this morning. I suppose that there’s not much of a way for future readers to see that, though if you were on the post last night, I apologize.</p></li>
<li><p>As a direct result of thinking about math and coding for my entire day yesterday, I did not write too much. According to my logs, I wrote a little under four hundred words of Jeb today. I need to write more, since I’m currently typing tomorrow’s chapter. I’m not sure where I’m trying to go with the story at this exact moment, which I think is part of the issue. My nominal plans for the book say that the next 85 chapters will cover a few<a href="#fn0413" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> amount of years in the character’s life. I suppose that sitting and blocking out what I want to happen could be a good idea.</p>

<li><p>Last night I left my laptop at work. Probably as a direct result, I wrote an entire song!<a href="#fn0414" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I did not journal. That’s probably fine.</p></li>
<li><p>I forgot to stretch this morning. Or, equally fairly, it was very hot and I wanted to not do anything.</p></li>
<li><p>I fell asleep at a normal time last night, which was nice. I also woke up before my goal of 6 am today, which was absolutely fantastic.</p></li>

<h1 id="for-twenty-five"><a href="twenty-five.html">25 for Twenty Five</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 August 23</p>
<h1 id="draft-4-25-june-24">Draft 4: 25 June 24</h1>
<p><a href="twenty-four.html">Last year</a> I tried to do twenty four things between my twenty fourth and twenty fifth birthday. It was a transition away from other, less healthy traditions. I had hoped that setting that goal would have two major effects on my life. First, I had hoped that it would make me more intentional about what I spend my time on. After all, even though I do not know what the number is, I do know that I only have a finite amount of time on this earth. While that has never meant<a href="#fn051" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> maximizing the utility of every single fleeting moment, I do find that I prefer to look back on my time when I have been more intentional with it, rather than less.</p>
<p>The second goal, obviously, was to encourage me to try new things. I don’t know how successful, if at all, that goal was. After all, as I have been told many times by far too many people, I am generally a person who is open to trying new things. That’s certainly something I strive to be, at least. That being said, I was at least more aware of things I had done for the first time, at least in my<a href="#fn052" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> memory.</p>
<p>So, since I enjoyed the challenge, I decided that I’d try it again. n for n is now being rebranded as my attempt to do more new things each passing calendar year.

<p>This post also feels like a good place to reflect on the first quarter century of my life. There are arguments to be made that nothing before I have concrete memory should really count, which I have mixed feelings about, and so will ignore. I’ve gotten a Master’s<a href="#fn053" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Degree, graduated a college with a double major, and earned my Eagle Scout. Those seem like sort of the big three in terms of explicit and externally validated life accomplishments, but there are far more things that I’ve done. I have received five of seven sacraments, which I’m beyond grateful for. I’ve also grown a lot, both physically and mentally. Most importantly, while I don’t think that any age<a href="#fn054" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> of previous me would have foreseen me being where I am right now, I also don’t think any of the past mes would be unhappy with it. I am grateful for the time I have had and look forward to the time to come. My fingers are crossed that I will get more than another quarter century on this earth, and I hope to use it well. Maudlin musing aside, there are some things that I want to do in this year. I think that updates for this post will be coming in two forms: things that I have done, and things that I want to do.

<h1 id="draft-3-27-november-23">Draft 3: 27 November 23</h1>
<p><a href="twenty-four.html">Last year</a> I tried to do twenty four things between my twenty fourth and twenty fifth birthday. It was a transition away from other, less healthy traditions. I had hoped that setting that goal would have two major effects on my life. First, I had hoped that it would make me more intentional about what I spend my time on. After all, even though I do not know what the number is, I do know that I only have a finite amount of time on this earth. While that has never meant<a href="#fn0535" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> maximizing the utility of every single fleeting moment, I do find that I prefer to look back on my time when I have been more intentional with it, rather than less.</p>
<p>The second goal, obviously, was to encourage me to try new things. I don’t know how successful, if at all, that goal was. After all, as I have been told many times by far too many people, I am generally a person who is open to trying new things. That’s certainly something I strive to be, at least. That being said, I was at least more aware of things I had done for the first time, at least in my<a href="#fn0536" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> memory.</p>
<p>So, since I enjoyed the challenge, I decided that I’d try it again. n for n is now being rebranded as my attempt to do more new things each passing calendar year. Since there are an infinite number of activities I can try, that should remain doable, especially if I start lowering my standards.</p>

<p>That puts me at a full fifth of the needed new activities, which is nice, especially since I haven’t gone through a full new month. Anyways, I hope to keep both of these lists updated, and hopefully I’ll be able to start moving things from the want to do list to the have done list. I have an awesome set of amazing friends, and I’m beyond grateful that they also do many fantastic things. Relevant to this post, one friend wants to do a good number of the things I want to do as well, which will be nice.</p>
<p>Since this posting is happening the same day that I’m also writing a full blog post, I’ll do my daily reflection there instead.</p>

<li><p>I want to finally learn how to spin yarn. A good friend gifted me with a starting set last year for my birthday, and I never got around to it.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to be able to swim a continuous mile. I don’t know if I ever have been able to before, and it seems like the sort of thing that I would like to be able to do.?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Huh, I hadn’t realized some of the things I wanted to do. I don’t know if I’ve ever articulated, to myself, at least, a desire to record an album. Apparently all those people who say that giving yourself space is good are true. Anyways, I have also done new things since turning twenty five! ?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I <a href="pinball.html">competed in a pinball league!</a><a href="#fn0573" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref73" role="doc-noteref"><sup>73</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I swam in Lake Superior!<a href="#fn0574" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref74" role="doc-noteref"><sup>74</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>? Anyways, I hope to keep both of these lists updated, and hopefully I’ll be able to start moving things from the want to do list to the have done list. I have an awesome set of amazing friends, and I’m beyond grateful that they also do many fantastic things. Relevant to this post, one friend wants to do a good number of the things I want to do as well, which will be nice. ? Since this is going to be a constantly updated draft, it feels a little strange to do my daily reflection in it, but c’est la vie.<a href="#fn0575" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref75" role="doc-noteref"><sup>75</sup></a> ?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Still haven’t worked on the eclipse talk, though I’m still thinking of ways to make the animations I know that I’ll want.</p></li>
<li><p>Once again, the slightest progress against entropy, which is still something I suppose</p></li>
<li><p>Wow three for three blogging!</p></li>
<li><p>Wrote this again first thing in the morning. Yesterday I finished a chapter and began the next one 2.1/4+</p></li>
<li><p>Wrote no poetry since the last post</p></li>
<li><p>Shoot, still no journaling.<a href="#fn0576" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref76" role="doc-noteref"><sup>76</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Stretched again this morning, but also woke up feeling very stiff which isn’t ideal.</p></li>
<li><p>Went to bed unreasonably early last night, but listening to my body is probably never a bad idea</p></li>
<li><p>I need to pray again?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>? Oh fun! I posted this a year and a day later!</p>

<h1 id="pinball-part-one"><a href="pinball.html">Pinball Part One</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 August 22</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Last Wednesday I competed in my first ever pinball tournament. I had no clue what it would be like going into it, which may not have been my best choice ever. Nonetheless, I knew a few important facts. ?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Signups were at six pm</p></li>
<li><p>Play started at half six<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>It was sponsored by a local craft brewery</p></li>
<li><p>There was a group play and a finals portion of the night?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As I told my friends going into it, my only real goal in the competition was making it past group play. As it turns out, that was a needlessly pessimistic goal. Everyone makes it into the finals, though not in the same bracket. ? I suppose I should explain the format of the competition. After signups, everyone is<a href="#fn062" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> randomly assigned to a group of four.<a href="#fn063" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Each group plays seven of the eight machines at the bar<a href="#fn064" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>, and they record their scores at the end of each three ball set.<a href="#fn065" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> They had a few extra rules, like that you weren’t allowed to play extra balls, which makes complete sense to me in retrospect. While it would not have made a huge difference for me, there were people whose every ball lasted at least five minutes. ? In my group of four, there was me,<a href="#fn066" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> the person who ended up winning the entire competition that night, the girlfriend of the brewery’s rep<a href="#fn067" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>, and a fourth person about as good as I was. Once group play ended, we all turned our slips of paper in to someone, who then ranked us best to worst. One rankings were done, I found out how finals work. When I had signed up, the organizer told me that they make sure it’s not just the absolute best players who get a prize, because that would discourage less good players from attending. ? So, we are all ranked from best to worst. The best four players go to a machine and play single elimination games until there is one person left.<a href="#fn068" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Now, you may be wondering how they pick which machine they go on. The top seed in each set gets to choose their machine.<a href="#fn069" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> I was the top seed of the fourth bracket<a href="#fn0610" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>, which was where they started putting us in groups of three.<a href="#fn0611" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> I chose Godzilla, because it was the most fun machine. At that point, I was incredibly nervous. One of the other people on my machine was the fourth player in my qualifier, who was notably better than me at the Godzilla machine. ?But, I managed to squeak out a win twice, and that meant that I got a prize.?I ended up taking home a four pack of craft beer.<a href="#fn0612" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>?I also took home a tshirt and some stickers, which was nice. I also learned while there that the brewery buys your first<a href="#fn0613" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> beer of the night. ?It was really fun, for all that it lasted much longer than I expected it to. I had really thought that the entire event would be over in two or three hours.?Instead, it took four, and that was apparently a quick tournament as far as their timings go.?I’ll probably do it again, though I’ll make sure to eat dinner first and know that I’ll be late rising the next day. ?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I need to start working on the eclipse talk again. I have some notes from friends who have made them in the past, which should be helpful in making the presentation, as soon as I start to look at them. Truthfully, I’m not entirely sure what the layout of my talk is going to be. Right now, I’m leaning towards building the solar system up from the sun, then the sun and earth, then adding the moon, then adding locks, etc. I don’t know if that’s the best idea, but it’s resonated with me for a week, which is generally a good sign. I should really blog about it sometime.</p></li>
<li><p>I think I made a slight bit of progress against entropy last night, though that was as minimal as it could get. Hopefully I have a little more energy tonight.</p></li>
<li><p>Blogged yesterday! And today! Wow look at me the best</p></li>
<li><p>I’m writing this post first thing in the morning, so no new book content. 1/4+</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote some iambic pentameter last night<a href="#fn0614" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> and a little more today<a href="#fn0615" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>. Maybe that’s a better thing for me to do right now than a whole sonnet. I know that’s an excuse, but any poetry is probably better than no poetry, and I’m mentally exhausted lately.</p></li>
<li><p>I did not journal today, though I meant to. I got a letter from a friend yesterday and a package from a different friend a few days ago. Both of those probably deserve and need responses.</p></li>
<li><p>I stretched last night and this morning, focusing on my hips and shoulders.<a href="#fn0616" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> I also ran on a treadmill yesterday and then swam.<a href="#fn0617" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I went to bed incredibly early last night, which meant I fell asleep somewhat early.</p></li>
<li><p>I should really pray rosaries more. That’s something I need to get back into.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once again, sorry for the rambling nature of the posting. That’s what the site encourages.? ?</p>

<p>First Published: 2023 August 21</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>It’s been a fair minute since the last time that I wrote this blog.?Sorry for that!?Hopefully future delays will happen with far less frequency and length. So, since my last posting, I’ve actually gone on more than one UitP. I’ve given five over the course of three events. They’ve all been incredible, though each in their own way. ?The first one I gave since accidentally giving up was at what I have to assume is the most popular state park in the state. It was scheduled for a Tuesday, and I even still had more than twenty people show up. Apparently in an average year, they get more than three million visitors, which is wild to me. ?The viewing of stars from that talk wasn’t the best I’ve ever had. Unfortunately, the place they recommended I set up was somewhat obscured by trees and the surrounding cliff. That isn’t too much of an issue, though, because historically most of the stars and other celestial bodies I care about seeing are in the upper portion of the sky anyways. It was also beside one of the shelters, which remains lit apparently all night long. That made it a little bit harder to see the stars. A number of my friends made it up to the talk, which was really nice!? After that, I had a brief few days off. That Friday and Saturday, though, I drove up to the northern part of the state. While there, I made a quick detour to drop off my accordion at the<a href="#fn071" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> accordion repair school. They had a museum, which I’ll hopefully find the time to blog about in the future. The talks were hosted by a pair of sister parks, and so they asked me to prepare multiple different presentations. Despite the fact that I’ve been assured each instance of my usual talk is different, I still made a new slide deck.<a href="#fn072" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Since my talks were scheduled during the peak of the Perseid<a href="#fn073" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> meteor shower, I made the new slide deck about that.<a href="#fn074" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Both nights, unfortunately, we were rained out from observing. Even more unfortunately, both nights the rain was completely unforeseen<a href="#fn075" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. The second talk proceeded much like the first, though with far more questions.? There was a camp of high schoolers who were very interested in black holes. As it turns out, one of the counselors for that camp is a rising student in the Astronomy PhD program at my university. It was great to meet him. A whole week went by without doing anything with the talks, since I planned to reuse my slides again this past weekend. At the end of the week, I drove just about as far north, though slightly further east this time, to give another two talks. Both nights had perfectly clear skies, which was fantastic. On the first night, my audience was primarily older people, members of the friends of the state park, which was cool. It was also by far the best prepared audience I’ve ever had. When I asked my standard starting question of “who has heard the term astrochemistry before?” most of them actually raised their hands. That was a surprise, but did mean that I had a number of great questions. After that, we looked at Mizar,<a href="#fn076" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> which I’m going to more and more use as a staple star. It’s really cool that it’s a double star.<a href="#fn077" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> When that talk ended, I went to sleep and woke up, excited for my second talk of the weekend. I took a leisurely drive up another hour north, stopping at a coffee shop, a few bakeries, and a farmer’s market. I also got to<a href="#fn078" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> take a ferry up to the island my next talk was on. It was apparently not advertised at all until five or so minutes before the talk began. Despite that, there were around thirty people at my talk, which is still great. ?Since I made it to the island plenty early, I had time to go swim in another Great Lake.?That was really fun and cool,<a href="#fn079" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> and the water was so clear. It was a really fun trip, for all that the seven hour drive the next day was less than my favorite thing to have ever done. ?I think that I only have one more of these talks scheduled for the summer, which is really weird. It both feels like too many and too few. I do regret not blogging at all during the five talks, but life got in the way.<a href="#fn0710" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> I’m also sorry if this post is far more verbose and rambly than normal. I’m trying out a <a href="4thewords.com">new word processor</a>, and it encourages high word counts.</p>

<h1 id="open-mic-planning"><a href="open-mic-planning.html">Open Mic Planning</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 August 4</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Apologies in advance, this is me using the need to blog as an excuse to plan my next open mic.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, I need to come up with a setlist for <a href="open-mic-7">an open mic</a>. I want to start learning more music as well, so hopefully I can.</p>
<p>Right now, I’m thinking the following songs:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Jonathan Original One<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Jonathan Original Three<a href="#fn082" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Ring of Fire<a href="#fn083" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>St. Olav’s Gate<a href="#fn084" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Fisherman’s Wharf<a href="#fn085" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I will follow you into the dark<a href="#fn086" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Maid on the Shore</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, that may be far more or less music than I need. I think that starting with Maid on the Shore makes the most sense, if only because I know that song like the back of my own hand.<a href="#fn087" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> From there, St. Olav’s Gate has a similar love lost, though far more consensually. The love segues into Ring of Fire nicely. From there, doing my first original could be fun, since it’s about heartbreak. My third original could follow that, because that’s the opposite order as last week. Assuming I still have time, I will follow you into the dark is better right now than Fisherman’s Wharf, so I’ll save Fishers for last.</p>
<p>If I still have too much time, Three Fishers is great<a href="#fn088" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> If that still isn’t enough music, I guess 45 Years is always a staple, or I could try Til Forever Falls Apart, depending if the friends I hope to show up do show up.<a href="#fn089" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>I made a lot of figures!<a href="#fn0810" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I made far less progress on entropy. I’m run down after this week. I still cleaned a little, just only slightly more than the mess I made.</p></li>
<li><p>Blogging streak continued.</p></li>
<li><p>I did not write today<a href="#fn0811" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> 2/4+</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote a sonnet last night. I’m beat, so I’ll skip it tonight<a href="#fn0812" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I wrote my first journal entry in the morning. It was weird.</p></li>
<li><p>Shoot! I really need to transcribe the song that I sang to myself.</p></li>
<li><p>I stretched less than before, though it was still nice.</p></li>
<li><p>I am now I think five for five not being in bed early enough this week. Hopefully that trend starts to break.</p></li>
<li><p>I did not do a rosary this morning because I knew that I would be doing one during an adoration hour tonight. That was a mistake, the morning rosary really helps me center my day.</p></li>

<h1 id="lemon-wine-starting-and-ending"><a href="lemon-wine-2.html">Lemon Wine Starting and Ending</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 August 3</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Huh, apparently my post in June about <a href="lemon-wine-2.hmtl">lemon wine</a> never posted. Anyways, it’s finally finished. It was almost certainly ready well before I ended up finishing it off, but I was busy and so gave it some extra time.</p>
<p>In the initial recipe notes, I said that I would dry hop it, which I no longer plan to do. I also said I would use three quarts of lemon juice, which ended up not being true. I saw a video discussing oleo citrum<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, and thought about how that could be nice in lemon wine.</p>
<p>So, I ended up peeling six lemons, getting about 4.5 ounces of lemon peel, which I mixed with around that much citric acid, let sit, then blended with the juice from the lemons.<a href="#fn092" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> That mixture went into the reracked lemon wine along with stabilizers. I then waited for a bit as I cleaned kegs and found access to CO2 again.</p>
<p>It is now safely inside of a keg, and has been receiving fantastic reviews. I’m really happy with it, and used the dregs from reracking to pitch the next set of lemon wine, which is my laziest attempt yet.</p>
<p>In short, the new version is just the entire 10 pound bag of sugar that I normally use for both fermenting and backsweetening at the beginning with no inverting. I then filled water, trusted that there would be sufficient nutrient, but repitched yeast just to be safe. It’s fermenting away, so I trust that it will go well as well. If so, I plan to dry hop it.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Made a few figures for the Pleiades<a href="#fn093" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> and added a few lines of text. It’ll need to be done much faster moving forwards.</p></li>
<li><p>I spent ten minutes cleaning this morning and made nice amounts of progress.</p></li>
<li><p>Blogging going well.</p></li>
<li><p>Finished today’s chapter of the book<a href="#fn094" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> 2/4+</p></li>
<li><p>Wrote a sonnet yesterday, plan to write one after this.</p></li>
<li><p>Wrote two letters! And posted three<a href="#fn095" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>No work on song, whoops. Should really get on this.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretched for a few minutes this morning, following part of my old diving routine.</p></li>
<li><p>So yeah I’m not prioritizing it as well today.</p></li>
<li><p>Did a nice chapel rosary. Then went and did a corporal work of mercy<a href="#fn096" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> and spent time praying at adoration and after. The rosary was far less intentional than yesterday, but growth is almost never straightforward and continuous.</p></li>
