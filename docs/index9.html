<p>Right now I’m reading a lot of LitRPG’s and some nearby genres. I’m not sure why, but if I had to guess, it’s mostly because the books generally expect minimal mental effort from me and have interesting premises. Anyways, I hope that I’ll start reading more thought-provoking books soon, but since I’m also planning to begin writing a book<a href="#fn001" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, who knows if that’ll happen</p>

<h1 id="draft-0.6-20-january-2022">Draft 0.6: 20 January 2022</h1>
<p>The major motivation of my research is bridging the gap between known terrestrial life, composed of complex chains of amino acids, and the assumed lack of life extraterrestrially. In the heat of stars, where heavier elements are formed, the intense radiation will prevent any sort of molecular bonds from occurring, leaving us with ionized monatomic species. Somewhere after these atoms are ejected from stars, they can form simple molecular species.</p>
<p>As these small species keep interacting, larger and more complex chemistries have been observed as occurring. Knowing exactly what species are present in these large molecular clouds is essential in order to generate accurate reaction mechanisms.</p>
<p>Something something there’s a need for rotational spectroscopy something something.</p>

<p>The major motivation of my research is bridging the gap between known terrestrial life, composed of complex chains of amino acids, and the assumed lack of life extraterrestrially. In the heat of stars, where heavier elements are formed, the intense radiation will prevent any sort of molecular bonds from occurring, leaving us with ionized monatomic species On the other end of the question of life, prior research has shown that a terrestrial and aqueous collection of amino acids will spontaneously self assemble into repeating patterns (life) when exposed to electricity.</p>
<p>The question then becomes how we can move from these single-atom ion into amino acids. Prior research has found many molecules which could be amino acid precursors, but there are yet to be complete models which produce these amino acids. As a result, we search for ions and radicals which would form these atoms.</p>
<h1 id="draft-0-a-text-i-sent">Draft 0: A text I sent</h1>
<p>So yeah our big motivation is that like life exists (allegedly) and we’re curious how close to life you can get without a rocky planet. We know if you put a bucket of amino acids together and shock them you get life, but most historic research suggests amino acids only form on planets. Bc space there’s lots of radicals and ions (bc nothing to react w and radiation), so we look at those as precursors</p>

<p>Something major that I’ve started doing since stopping my blog last is yarn craft. The spring break after I got back from London, one of my fellow Grinnell Singers taught me<a href="#fn031" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> how to knit.</p>
<p>When I returned to work at the math lab, my boss asked if I wanted to learn crochet. I did, and found that I significantly preferred crochet to knitting, mostly because it is much more freeform. With knitting, you’re by and large limited to rectangular shapes due to the nature of using two needles to put stitches on and off.</p>
<p>Crochet, on the other hand, is primarily left off of the hook, so you can craft whatever shape you’d want much more easily. Anyways, in 2021 I don’t think I crocheted much of anything, but in the first few days of 2022 I started again, and I forgot how good it is as a destresser<a href="#fn032" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>

<p>First Published: 2022 January 6</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As someone who does a lot of math-adjacent work<a href="#fn051" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, I often have to do lots of repetitive calculations. Since I am easily bored, I tried to find a way to not have to do the same equation 100 times with only minor modifications. Growing up in a CS heavy household, I realized that I could try to use computers to do some of the math for me.</p>
<p>So, I asked my family “What language should I learn?” They responded<a href="#fn052" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Python, because lots of reasons which boil down to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It’s easy</p></li>
<li><p>It’s commonly used</p></li>
</ul>
<p>But as I worked in Python, I became dissatisfied.</p>
<p>Anyways, flash forward to today where I’m now learning Racket. Racket is built on Scheme which is built on Lisp. Lisp is a language<a href="#fn053" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> that developed in parallel to C<a href="#fn054" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>-like languages, which is based on the idea of lambda calculus.</p>
<p>It uses a lot of parentheses, and it has been fun to figure out how to use it. Today I wanted to see if 12 steps to the octave really is the best approximation<a href="#fn055" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. Turns out it is in fact the best up to 47 divisions of the octave! And I did that in Racket, which is fun and exciting. If you want my<a href="#fn056" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> code, feel free to message me.</p>

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>If you’ve seen some of my <a href="boiling-water.html">earlier post</a>s, you might notice that I sometimes used to mention recipes I’d cooked here. Mostly this serves as a way for me to<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> recreate these dishes at a later time.</p>
<p>My brothers kindly gave me a<a href="#fn062" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> 5 kilogram chocolate bar for Christmas. Now, if you’re anything like me, you immediately thought of the same thing to use the chocolate for! That’s right, candied orange peel.</p>
<p>Well, being fair, my mind went:</p>

<h1 id="screaming-into-the-void-or-why-im-still-writing-this"><a href="screaming-into-void.html">Screaming Into the Void, or Why I’m (Still) Writing This</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 January 3</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Something that I reflected on at least once in my initial blogging<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> is why I wrote it. In part it was due to an assignment to journal more, and in part it was to keep people in my life updated on my whereabouts and doings.</p>
<p>Of course, a lot has changed since August 2018. That class ended, for one. I’ve finished my semester abroad. I’ve graduated college and started my Ph.D. Program. I’ve moved to a new city and state, where I will<a href="#fn082" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> be for the next 3 or so years. Most of my day-to-day isn’t surprising to anyone who knows me.</p>
<p>So I have to think about what this blog is for anymore. It’s not enough for me to think of it as a way to force myself to write more<a href="#fn083" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, because I can write in other ways or in other places. It’s not enough for me to claim that this could be useful for my family, friends, and loved ones<a href="#fn084" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> to know what’s happening in my mind, because I self censor far too much for that, and I talk to them besides. It’s not even enough for me to reflect on how great it was to see what I wrote while in London as a way of remembering my own past, which was incredibly enjoyable the other day.</p>
<p>Instead, I think my goal for writing this blog in 2022 will be to see it as<a href="#fn085" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> screaming into the void. As a scientist, one metaphor that has stuck with me is the idea of the sum of human knowledge being represented as a sphere.<a href="#fn086" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Our job as scientists is to pick one infinitesimally small point on that sphere and push it just the slightest bit forward.</p>
<p>In time, our protrusion into the void of the unknown may be the starting point needed for others to push their own ideas forward and bring the world into a better way. Or, the protrusion may end up simply remaining there, unused but known.</p>
<p>In this image, all of science<a href="#fn087" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> is dedicated to looking away the safe and comfortable bubble of the known and used, and staring into the void of the unknown, trying to pin something down to add to the bubble of safety.</p>
<p>In some sense, that’s one of my goals here. Every way that I self-reflect, whether talking to others about myself, thinking about myself, writing about myself, writing as myself<a href="#fn088" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>, or even just existing pushes me into new truths about myself. If my goal<a href="#fn089" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> is to know myself, how can I say that I’m working towards it if I refuse to expand my bubble of knowledge into the void.</p>
<p>More like music than chemistry, I expand into the void not by study and measurement, but by creation and action. By writing this blog daily, staring into the void which is the genesis of my writings, I hope that in time I will be able to better see how and why I act the way I do.</p>
<p>Of course, there are other benefits I hope to enjoy as well. For instance, my Sunday reflections on the Gospels I hope to use as a way of deepening my faith and my connection to the Lord. My study posts I hope to use to pass my classes.<a href="#fn0810" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> My posts about concerts and events I see I hope to use to encourage myself to go to those events more, so I have an easy excuse not to self reflect for a day.</p>
<p>One final reason, though it’s less cheerful than the rest, is similar to a reason my inspiration for this blog came from. He wrote<a href="#fn0811" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> his blog in part because of the knowledge of his own mortality. When he is no longer here, he hopes that the blog he writes will be a source of fond memory and a way to connect with him for his family and loved ones. If I’m being honest with myself, that has to be a part of what I’m doing too. I hope that something that I write here, as I scream into the apparent void of unlisted urls, unpublicized blogs, and my own unknown mind, that at some point the signal will reach someone I love long past when I wrote it.</p>

<p>Matthew 2:10: “They were overjoyed at seeing the star,”</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>In today’s reading we are told that the Magi were “overjoyed” to see the Holy Family. This upcoming year that’s something I’d like to focus more on. Too often I feel like I do not really engage wholly with the Real Presence in Adoration and Mass.</p>
<p>In the first reading, we hear that “(n)ations shall walk by your light, kings by the radiance of your dawning”<a href="#fn092" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, which this year for me is a reminder for me that we are not called to keep the joy and love of our Lord hidden beneath shades and covered up. Rather, we are called to be the light in others’ lives through all our words and deeds. As I begin this year, this message is calling me to be the bright light in the lives of those around me.</p>
