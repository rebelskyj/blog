<p>Today I tried baking again. Instead of the attempts I’d made before, where I made one full-size cake, and asked for others to compare to no reference, today I made 5 small recipes and had comparisons from there. The five recipes I tested were: the original, browned butter and coffee, browned then cooled butter and coffee, just coffee, and just browned butter. I had two amazing friends who were willing to taste test for me.</p>
<p>Sadly, one person’s favorite<a href="#fn001" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> was the other’s least favorite: browned butter and coffee That was the browned and coffeed recipe. Both found the browned, coffeeless recipe a close second, so that appears to be a good choice. However, the original was also one’s favorite and the other’s third favorite. So, I’ll probably try those two recipes on Saturday, as I have a chance to talk to the judge again.</p>

<p>Merry Christmas! Today, I had the wonderful opportunity to celebrate Christmas with family and friends. It was amazing. And, as my sleep schedule is pushing me to bed earlier and earlier, I am reminded of the quote “merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night.”</p>

<p>First Published: 2018 December 24</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Christmas Eve has always been a weird day to me. Mostly, this is because I accept that<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> days start and end at sunset. That’s the reason for Vigil Masses and such. However, Eve means <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&amp;search=eve">the evening before.</a> So, the idea of Christmas Eve just seems weird to me. The evening before Christmas is technically the 23.</p>

<p>Luke 1:45 “Blessed are you who believed that what was spoken to you by the Lord would be fulfilled.”</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today’s Gospel, as befits the eve of Christmas Eve, is very focused on the coming of the Lord. The first reading tells how Bethlehem will be where “one who is to be ruler in Israel” comes from.<a href="#fn031" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The Gospel takes place right after Mary accepts the angel telling her that she will become pregnant.</p>
<p>Her cousin Elizabeth sees her and recognizes what child she carries. The Gospel ends with the message I hear in different variations almost daily from friends and others who profess the Christian faith. However, none speak it<a href="#fn032" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> as well as Elizabeth does, as befits one consumed by the Spirit. We are told many things by the Lord. We are told that we will be blessed if we believe.</p>
<p>Of course, we also know that believing requires doing. Without this belief, Mary could have believed that the angel was from God and still said no. But instead, because she believed and trusted in the Lord, she accepted the angel’s request, saying “May it be done to me according to your word.”<a href="#fn033" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>First Published: 2018 December 22</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today, I tried the recipe again. It came out more solid, though less strong flavored, and with a texture described as “grainy.” All in all, I’d say it’s marginally better.</p>

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As I mentioned <a href="baking-competition.html">before</a>, in a few weeks I’ll be competing in a baking competition. So, today I tried making the recipe for the first time. Reviews were generally positive, though many commented that the flavor was almost too strong. Given that I remember the recipe having a strong chocolate flavor before browning the butter and adding coffee, that would make sense. So, next time I make it, I’ll have to also try adding on the whipped cream and strawberries.</p>
<p>Right now, I need to think of a way to lighten the dish, as most reviewers found it too strong. I hope that adding the whipped cream will be enough to lighten it. Tomorrow should tell me.</p>

<p>As in <a href="first-56-hours.html">one of my first posts</a>, I’m using this as a space to reflect on my time back home. Not much has changed at Grinnell, other than some new faces showing up and some old faces not being there. The codes to some doors I need to use have changed, others have stayed the same. All in all, these first few hours back in Grinnell are far less shocking than the same in London.</p>

<p>Yesterday, my brother and I were eating together. While doing so, I flipped through my notebook, because he and I were bored. I saw that I had made a map of all 24 major and minor chords, connected by the movements of a single note in a triad.<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I was wondering if there was a better way to represent it than the interlocking circle I’d made. While the answer appears to be no,<a href="#fn082" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> it still sparked an idea.</p>
<p>Today, we<a href="#fn083" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> made a program to auto-generate a chord progression that moves along the three valid Neo-Riemannian steps, P,R, and L. As is often the case, none of the code in the initial working model ended up in the final. Using the input of the beginning chord and desired number of changes, it pseudo<a href="#fn084" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>-randomly<a href="#fn085" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> generates a progression. One example that I just generated, using 25 chords from CM is: CM-&gt;Cm-&gt;EbM-&gt;Cm-&gt;CM-&gt;Am-&gt;CM-&gt;Am-&gt;CM-&gt;Am-&gt;CM-&gt;Cm-&gt;AbM-&gt;Abm-&gt;AbM-&gt;Abm-&gt;AbM-&gt;Abm/G#m-&gt;EM-&gt;Em-&gt;GM-&gt;Gm-&gt;EbM-&gt;Ebm-&gt;EbM. If you’d like to hear what that sounds like as generated by a midi keyboard, or if you’d like to try the program yourself, feel free to mail me at .</p>
