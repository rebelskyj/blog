<p>Last night went well! I ended up doing my two original songs and Stan Roger’s “Maid on the Shore,” because it’s a little bit spooky, which is good Halloween vibes. I had another person comment that the song seemed incredibly sad, and that I seemed sad while performing it, which is fun. It’s especially fun because they then commented on how not sad I seem otherwise.</p>
<p>I ended up staying later than normal, and played another set. That one was significantly less prepared, so I did two more Stan Rogers songs that I kind of know. It could have gone better but, that’s the way the cookie crumbles. I realize I never actually figured out how to end them in playing, so it was awkward.</p>

<p>Tonight I’m playing at the open mic alone for the first time.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I’m a little nervous, especially since I’m only like 60% sure what I want to play. But, hopefully I get home early enough tonight to relay my time.</p>
