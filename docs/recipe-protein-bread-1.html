<p>First Published: 21 January 2025</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As I’ve mentioned in the last few posts, I’m trying to organize my life under a few different principles. Notably, I wanted to make sure that, even though the USDA seems less than clear about their need, I get enough phytonutrients of each kind. When I looked through my diet and what I could easily add to my diet<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, I was missing aliums and purple fruit. With that in mind, I decided to try to make a bread that incorporated them.</p>
<p>At the store, dried figs and daikon<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> were the mixins that spoke to me most. Below is the recipe I vaguely followed, along with a quick back of the envelope calculation for macronutrients.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Add approximately 500 grams of flour<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and 650 grams of water<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> to a bowl, mix until a thick paste is formed, and add in about a tablespoon of yeast.</p></li>
<li><p>Upon being allowed to rise<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>, shred approximately 250 grams of daikon<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> and squeeze to remove moisture.</p></li>
<li><p>Finely chop 250 grams of fig, and also add to the dough<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Also add 100 grams of rye flour, 100 grams of almond flour<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>, 25 grams of vital wheat gluten, 250 grams of greek yogurt to the mixture and begin to knead. I ultimately needed to add another 300 grams of flour<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> and 10 grams of gluten to get the dough to be the appropriate level of sticky, which is to say not at all. I also added salt somewhere in there, but that was eyeballed at best.</p></li>
<li><p>I oiled the ball and let double, then divided into twelve even balls of approximately 200 grams.</p></li>
<li><p>I forgot about them overnight and so found them to be overproofed, so reshaped, heated oven to 350 for 30 minutes as they reproofed, and baked at 350 for 30 minutes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>How did they turn out? Honestly pretty well. I’m happy with the taste, if only because the fig comes through, but the daikon doesn’t at all. I didn’t love how sulfurous the daikon smelled while shredding or baking, though, and so might have to take steps to prevent that in the future. Chief among these, I think that I’ll try shredding into cold water that’s been doped<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> with either salt or baking soda, since those seem to work for others. Other than that, I might add more of either the daikon or fig, since they’re shockingly under noticed, for being a full 45 percent of the mass of the dough.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>What else went wrong? I don’t love the texture. I’m not sure if that’s due to the relatively low flour to other ratio, the overproofing, or something to do with using whole wheat flour. Regardless, I will probably try the next batch without rye, since I didn’t notice much by way of flavor from it, and it definitely does a lot to add that kind of texture. I’ll also try not to let the dough overproof, but that’s far more optimistic.</p>
<p>Nutrition Information as Eyeballed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>840 g<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> of whole wheat flour. Its bag says 100 calories, 4 grams of protein, 20 grams carbs, 3 grams fiber, and 0.5 grams fat per 28 grams.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Somehow, that means I used exactly 30 servings of flour, for a total of 3000 calories, 120 grams of protein, 600 grams of carbs, 90 grams of fiber, 15 grams of fat.</p></li>
<li><p>650 grams water, which is nutritionless</p></li>
<li><p>267 grams <a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/2709803/nutrients">daikon</a>, which is 16 calories, 0.68 grams of protein, 0.1 grams of fat, 3.4 grams of carbs, and 1.6 grams of fiber per 100 grams. That means a total of 43 calories, 1.8 grams of protein, .267 grams of fat, 9 grams of carbs, and 4.3 grams of fiber total.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>254 grams of fig, and that’s all I’m going to be putting in here because I don’t think anyone needs me to do the math.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In total:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>5150<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> calories</p></li>
<li><p>210<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> grams protein</p></li>
<li><p>85<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> grams fat</p></li>
<li><p>900<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> grams carbs</p></li>
<li><p>145<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> grams fiber</p></li>
</ul>
<p>which, assuming I split my rolls perfectly, comes out to about:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>430 calories</p></li>
<li><p>17.5 grams of protein</p></li>
<li><p>7 grams of fat</p></li>
<li><p>75 grams of carbs</p></li>
<li><p>12 grams of fiber</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In total, about 24 calories per gram of protein, well below the 40 threshold I need to average over the day. It is interesting how calorically empty daikon is, and how relatively dense fig is.</p>
<p>Daily reflection:</p>
<p>Didn’t do great about maintaining the schedule I set, but did do more than expected, all things considered.</p>
