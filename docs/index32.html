<p>Last night I tried switching browsers from metal to the browser which used to be FOSS other than its logo, which prompted the CS department at my local school to use a reskin with a non-copyrighted logo. I really hope I understand what that sentence means in three years.</p>

<p>I’ve recently been thinking about how to live my life more intentionally. Something that I’ve been having a lot of luck with in the past days is having a list of activities to do each day. I really like how well it’s been going for me.</p>

<p>Lasterday I wrote about creative hobbies, so it seems only fair that today I talk about one of mine. Currently I’m moving my art from celtic knots to not doing to some symmetric art. My current piece is a line art that has vertical and horizontal symmetry.</p>
<p>I’ve almost finished, so have to decide on my next one.</p>

<p>To me, all of these are creation-hobbies. Obviously, this is a non-exhaustive list, and I would not even stake a claim that my three categories are themselves exhaustive. But, in the first category, you can create goods which others look at time and time again, reminding them that they are loved each time they do. The second, though transient, can show that you were thinking of them and, in the first and third, share the most vital of human connections, food. The third shares our mind and heart with others in the most direct way, which can make it the hardest to truly share.

<p>John 2:4: “Jesus said to her, “Woman, how does your concern affect me? My hour has not yet come.””</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As I mentioned <a href="reflections-on-readings-2-ordinary-c.html">last time I read these</a>, my family really likes the readings that happen this week. This time around, the concept that the Lord’s “hour ha[d] not yet come” really stuck with me, because it says that He was there with his disciples.</p>
<p>I know that I’ve always been taught that this was the beginning of His ministry, so I’m unsure why he already has disciples. But, it’s still beautiful that He listened to His mother without question.</p>

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>I’ve <a href="toffee-recipe.html">written before</a> about how I make toffee, but I made it again for the first time in a long while today, and that seemed appropriate to blog about here. As before, the recipe is 1:1 sugar and butter, heated to hot then cooled. This time, however, as I have <a href="candied-orange.html">too much chocolate</a>, I decided to make the toffee the way most of the internet suggests I should: chocolate covered. It came out well!</p>
<p>I guess it’s unsurprising that a recipe which<a href="#fn051" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> is just 1 part chocolate, sugar, and butter, could come out well. Nonetheless, it was really fun to see that I can, in fact, make things taste good. I unfortunately didn’t let my chocolate cool enough before mixing it into the cookie dough but that’s life I suppose, I’ll have moreso chocolate than chocolate chip cookie.</p>

<p>First Published: 2022 January 14</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Some times in my life I really think of as listening times. On some occasions that means hearing a friend as they share something deep and personal in their life. At others, it means hearing a story or tale as it weaves. Still others are when I get to sit in silence and hear my own thoughts as they interplay with the natural<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> noises around me. And finally, sometimes I get to listen to intentional music.</p>
<p>Tonight is one of those nights. I was reminded of a fantastic curated playlist that an amazing person made for me, and got to listen to it. There were no familiar songs on it, and only a few familiar artists, which made the experience fantastic. Much like me, the playlist generator used so many genres and styles, which gave a very nice experience</p>

<p>Walking in winter is always interesting to me, especially when it’s<a href="#fn071" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> warmer. Tonight it was around freezing. That being the case, I was wearing my coat unzipped, which a friend remarked on. I thought back to childhood, where my ideal winter outfit was often warm gloves, a hat, boots, shorts, and a t-shirt.</p>
<p>As I’ve grown older, some of that’s changed. I’ve adapted to colder feet, and I’ve grown my hair to keep my ears warm. My chest and legs have started getting colder, which is a little sad. But, gloves<a href="#fn072" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> remain my most crucial winter clothing article.</p>

<p>First Published: 2022 January 12</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Sometimes when my mental health is feeling really good, I forget that it’s ever bad. And, the reverse is certainly true. When I’m not doing great mentally, my brain cannot bring to memory any time that I’ve been content and calm. I think that’s a really interesting feature of my psyche, though certainly not one I’d prefer. I’ve been trying to think of ways to get around this, and most of them come to some variation of bullet journaling.</p>
<p>I recently saw a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSwpe8r50_o">CGP Grey Video</a> about ways to improve productivity/life in a journal. I’ve been on my same<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> journal since<a href="#fn082" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> 2019, so filling the physical journal would also be fantastic. I guess I often struggle because I feel like I lack accountability with anything, especially anything self-motivated. But, I would also really like to be in a better place longer, which is fun, so I guess I should focus on it.</p>

<p>Right now I’m reading a lot of LitRPG’s and some nearby genres. I’m not sure why, but if I had to guess, it’s mostly because the books generally expect minimal mental effort from me and have interesting premises.
