<p>Happy first Sunday in Advent, New Liturgical Year, and First Night of Hanukkah! Advent has always been my favorite season in the Church. It helps that I have really 5 options: Advent, Christmas, Lent, Easter, and Ordinary Time. But, Advent has always been nice because it’s the period where we wait for a wholly positive event to occur. Unlike Easter, which saves our souls at the cost of the Lord’s life, Christmas is nothing more or less than a celebration of the birth of our Savior.</p>
<p>And yet, the Gospel today is not about Christ the meek child being born to a virgin, surrounded by shepherds. Instead, it’s a reference and prophesy about the Lord’s next coming. It tells us that we must stay awake and vigilant, and not be snared by the problems of our life. And really, that’s what Advent is about. It’s a preparatory season where we assess ourselves and begin to hope that we could be worthy to welcome the baby Jesus into the world.</p>
<p>It’s interesting reading today’s readings, because they fall really nicely in a chronology. The First Reading talks about the first coming of Jesus, the season we celebrate in just a few weeks. The Psalm and Second Reading tell us the message Jesus often spoke, that we are to be holy and loving through all that we do. Then, the Gospel talks about the second coming. It’s a great reminder of the way we are to view Advent, which is a celebration of the Lord’s birth, life, and second coming.</p>

<p>As I mentioned <a href="polymer-3.html">yesterday</a>, today we’re talking about crystals. Polymers are known as semi-crystalline, because they have both crystalline and amorphous sections. Some might wonder why polymers can’t be wholly crystalline.<a href="#fn011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> As I<a href="#fn012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> have mentioned before, polymers are weird because more or less all of their strength comes from the inter-molecular forces that hold them together, as opposed to normal matter, which I have no clue how it works apparently. Anyways, if a polymer is fully crystalline, it doesn’t have any entanglements with other polymer chains, and so will become a powder, because each polymer is wholly self contained. So, in short, they can it just isn’t useful.</p>
<p>Semi-crystalline<a href="#fn013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> polymers are especially useful when used in applications where the Heat Distortion Temperature (HDT) is useful, because for most crystalline polymers, the HDT is far larger than the T<sub>g</sub>. Another way to increase the HDT of a polymer is through addition of glass particles. Those increase stiffness, and effectively just shift the modulus of the material directly upwards. Since amorphous polymers lose strength so quickly around T<sub>g</sub>, the addition of glass does nearly nothing. However, crystalline polymers lose strength more slowly, so the addition of particles is helpful.</p>
<p>Crystals in polymers form as lamellae, the ordered regions within a polymer. Lamellae clump together into spherulites, which are what looks like the crystal in a polymer. In order for crystals to form, the polymer must not be atactic.</p>
<p>Polymers can only crystallize when below T<sub>m</sub>, because that’s what T<sub>m</sub> means. When below T<sub>m</sub>, polymer crystallization rate is affected by two factors: nucleation and growth.</p>
<p>Nucleation is the formation of the spherulites. It occurs more quickly the further below T<sub>m</sub> you get, until T<sub>g</sub> is reached, because then the polymer can’t move. Other ways to increase the rate of nucleation include strain/shear stress. In a wholly homogenous polymer, the polymer will spontaneously crystallize, but that is slow. Most polymers have a nucleating agent added to them, commonly sorbitol. But, almost anything in a polymer, including dyes, other polymers, and glass particles can also act as a nucleation point. In general, the more nucleation points there are, the smaller the final size of a spherulite.<a href="#fn014" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Small spherulite size can be beneficial, especially if it can be made smaller than the wavelength of light, so a bottle can be see through.<a href="#fn015" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> The rate of nucleation increases as T drops until T<sub>g</sub>.</p>
<p>The other factor, growth, is exactly what it sounds like. Once nucleated, the spherulites grow. Their growth rate is fastest somewhere between T<sub>m</sub> and T<sub>g</sub>, though closer to T<sub>m</sub>. This is because as T increases, the flexibility of the polymer chain increases. That makes it easier to align, but also easier to unalign. So, by plotting the two rates together, you can find the optimal temperature to cool to in order to let a polymer crystalize.</p>
<p>If, after cooling below T<sub>g</sub>, you realize the polymer needs to be more crystalline, then you can anneal it. That is, you can raise it above T<sub>g</sub> so that the polymer can form into crystals.</p>
<p>Fun fact: although incredibly regular, the chain stiffness of polycarbonate is such that it is not crystalline in consumer uses because of the time required.</p>

<p>First Published 2018 November 30</p>
<p>Prereading note: I actually looked in my notes for this one!</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today we’re talking about the factors that affect T<sub>g</sub> and T<sub>m</sub>. Factors that affect T<sub>g</sub> will affect all polymers, while the factors that affect T<sub>m</sub> will only affect semi-crystalline thermoplastics.</p>
<p>There are four main kinds of factors that affect T<sub>g</sub>: intramolecular forces, intermolecular forces, chain length, and timescale.</p>
<p>The intramolecular forces that affect T<sub>g</sub> are: chain stiffness, side groups, and cross link density. As chain stiffness goes up,<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> T<sub>g</sub> goes up. This is because as the amount of energy it takes to rotate along a bond<a href="#fn022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> increases, so too does T<sub>g</sub>. As side groups become bulkier, they increase T<sub>g</sub>, for the same reason. As cross-link density goes up, so does T<sub>g</sub>, This is because it’s hard to rotate around a link, because the side group is suddenly large. Also, if cross-link density isn’t 0, there is no T<sub>m</sub>.</p>
<p>The intermolecular forces that affect T<sub>g</sub> are: side group dipole moments,<a href="#fn023" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> side group chain length, and plasticizers. As the side groups become more polar, T<sub>g</sub> goes up, because it draws the different polymer chains closer together. For that same reason, as side groups become longer, T<sub>g</sub> goes down, because it keeps them further away. For that same reason, plasticizers also tend to lower T<sub>g</sub>.</p>
<p>Third, assuming the molecular mass is less than M<sub>e</sub>,<a href="#fn024" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> the increase of molecular mass will increase T<sub>g</sub>. Above M<sub>e</sub>, there is effectively no difference in T<sub>g</sub> for chain length.</p>
<p>Finally, everything in polymers is time dependent. This makes sense when you think about how free energy diagrams work. At any temperature above 0K, there’s some energy. Given enough time, any bond can rotate, because it’ll at some point be able to overcome its energy barrier. Heating it just makes that happen faster. So, T<sub>g</sub> decreases as the time-scale you view it from increases. This also works in reverse, so a polymer that’s being stressed at high rates will remain solid at higher temperatures than one that is not.</p>
<p>In order of importance, the intramolecular forces are more important than the intermolecular forces are more important than the other two in governing T<sub>g</sub>.<a href="#fn025" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>So, assuming cross-link density is 0, eventually the polymer will become viscous.<a href="#fn026" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> This is affected mainly by the same factors that influence T<sub>g</sub>, which is why they have the relationship <a href="polymer-2.html">I talked about in Polymer Review 2</a>. As interactions between the chains goes up, T<sub>m</sub> goes up. As chain stiffness goes up, T<sub>m</sub> goes up. As branching<a href="#fn027" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> goes up, T<sub>m</sub> goes down. As delta S<a href="#fn028" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> goes up, T<sub>m</sub> goes down. To explain this, T<sub>m</sub> can also be expressed as delta H<a href="#fn029" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> divided by delta S<a href="#fn0210" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>. Turning a crystal, which is highly ordered, into a liquid, which is not, increases the entropy of the state a lot. So, somehow that also works in reverse? This part is where the physics goes beyond me.</p>
<p>To lower delta S, you can orient the polymer more. This leads well into crystals which is almost certainly the topic of tomorrow’s post.</p>

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Polymers are super cool, for a variety of reasons. The one that I’m thinking of today is that they take all of the things that you get told in chemistry class exist but don’t matter, and then suddenly make them matter. The two examples of that I’m thinking of are the fact that the main force holding polymers together is their Van Der Waals interactions, which is the force I’ve<a href="#fn035" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> always been able to ignore as non-significant for a material. The other is that polymers treat all energy as energy. That is, the temperature that a polymer needs to be at to behave as a liquid is lower if mechanical energy is supplied.</p>
<p>Speaking of, there are a few phases that polymers exist in. I’ll briefly discuss them from lowest to highest temperature.</p>
<p>At the coldest, a polymer is in what’s known as the “glassy” state. Here, it is solid, brittle, and the chains are held rigid.</p>
<p>When you heat up, you’ll eventually reach the glass transition temperature, T<sub>g</sub>. This is the temperature range where the polymer would be described as “leathery.” It also corresponds to a quick drop in modulus.<a href="#fn036" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> This is due to the fact that below T<sub>g</sub>, the energy needed to break the Van Der Waals bonds is higher, because the polymer is moving less. Once you reach T<sub>g</sub>, however, the polymers move enough on their own that the Van Der Waals forces effectively disappear. The only thing that gives the polymer strength then is the entanglements, which we talked about <a href="polymer-1.html">yesterday</a> as M<sub>e</sub>. Above T<sub>g</sub>, you’re in the rubber phase. This is where a polymer behaves a lot like what we think rubber does. And, right near T<sub>g</sub>, the material exhibits a lot of damping.</p>
<p>After T<sub>g</sub>, you reach what’s known as T<sub>m</sub>, which is the temperature where the polymer stops acting like a solid, and begins acting like a fluid. Apparently it’s only melting when crystals do that, so that isn’t what happens to many polymers. One interesting tidbit is that polymers that are crystalline<a href="#fn037" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> will have a T<sub>m</sub> equal to 1.5x the T<sub>g</sub> in Kelvin.</p>
<p>The information about T<sub>m</sub> only applies to thermoplastics, polymers that don’t have chemical crosslinks. If a polymer has crosslinks, it never reaches the viscous phase. Instead, it stays at the “rubber plateau” for modulus until the material ultimately burns.<a href="#fn038" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>The other thing to note that is different about amorphous and semi-crystalline polymers is that the drop at T<sub>g</sub> is much larger in amorphous polymers than in semi-crystalline, because T<sub>g</sub> is where amorphous regions fail, while T<sub>m</sub> is where the crystalline sections fail. So, since a semi-crystalline polymer has a much smaller composition of amorphous polymer, it loses less strength.</p>

<p>Prereading Note: I’ll apologize in advance for what will likely be most of my posts until the end of the semester. Of all the classes I’m in, only one has a final, my class on polymers. So as a way to review, I’ll be describing different concepts here, if only so that I know that I know them.</p>
<h1 id="draft-3-11-december">Draft 3: 11 December</h1>
<p>I was wrong on calculating M<sub>w</sub>.<a href="#fn041" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> To calculate M<sub>w</sub>, you do as I said, and take the chains, 10 of 10 and 10 of 100. Multiply the number of chains by their mass, and sum them (total: 1100). Divide the mass sums of each chain length by the total mass (1/11,10/11). Multiply these numbers by the sum mass of each length (1/11*100+10/11*1000) We end up with a M<sub>w</sub> of approximately 920, which now that I look at it, seems much more reasonable.</p>
<p>M<sub>n</sub> just is the arithmatic mean of the masses. To find it, you sum the mass of all of the chains and divide by the number of chains that are measured.</p>
<p>To find M<sub>w</sub>, you can also sum each chain multiplied by the square of the mass and then divide by the sum of chains multiplied by masses.</p>
<p>M<sub>w</sub></p>
<h1 id="draft-2-30-november">Draft 2: 30 November</h1>
<p>M<sub>e</sub> is the molecular mass required for entanglements to form, as well as the molecular mass between the entanglements apparently, which is really weird and I should reconfirm this with the textbook.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today, I’ll be discussing the different ways of measuring the mass of a polymer. As far as I remember, there are only four that are relevant to me for the final: M<sub>n</sub>, M<sub>w</sub>, M<sub>z</sub>, and M<sub>e</sub>. I’ll discuss each one in turn, first with how you calculate it, and then what it is used for.</p>
<p>So, first is M<sub>n</sub>. M<sub>n</sub> is the number average molecular mass of a polymer. As such, like M<sub>w</sub> and M<sub>z</sub>, it’s only useful for thermoplastics. To calculate M<sub>n</sub>, you divide the mass of each polymer chain by its numerical representation, then sum all of those. So, if you have 10 chains with a mass of 10, and 10 with a mass of 100, it’s 10/2+100/2 = 55 for M<sub>n</sub>. Since M<sub>n</sub><a href="#fn042" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> is the molecular weight most concerned with the number of short chains, it’s good for telling you about how a polymer will yield, especially once it begins to crack.</p>
<p>Next is M<sub>w</sub>. M<sub>w</sub> is the weight average molecular mass, and is the most common/useful of them. To calculate M<sub>w</sub>, you divide the mass of each polymer chain by its mass representation, then sum all of those. So, in the initial example, 10 chains of 10 and 10 chains of 100, you would get 100+1000=1100, and then 100/1100+1000/1100 = around 92. So, we immediately see that M<sub>w</sub> is more easily measured, because it’s easier to measure the mass of a polymer than the number of chains. M<sub>w</sub> is most relevant for the processability of the polymer, especially its flow in the molten state.</p>
<p>M<sub>z</sub> is weird. Like M<sub>w</sub>, it weights the mass, but it takes it the next step, and does the square of the mass. M<sub>w</sub> is relevant mostly in governing die swell, also known as melt-elasticity.</p>
<p>Finally, we have M<sub>e</sub>. M<sub>e</sub> is the measure of the mass between entanglements. Off the top of my head<a href="#fn043" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> I don’t know how this is measured. But, it’s mostly useful for knowing how strong the polymer will be in the rubber phase.<a href="#fn044" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>So, yeah. There’s four major ways to say the mass of a polymer. Oh! Also, the difference between M<sub>n</sub> and M<sub>w</sub> is known as the Molecular Weight Distribution, MWD. That tells you how much strain softening will occur. A larger (broader) MWD will lead to more strain softening.</p>
<p>In conclusion, polymers are weird. Hopefully by the end of these posts you’ll understand why if you don’t already.</p>

<p>Today is the last Sunday in the<a href="#fn071" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> year, the Feast of Christ the King.<a href="#fn072" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> It’s a great way to end the year, especially because we get a line from my<a href="#fn073" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> favorite book, Revelations.</p>
<p>We also get to use today as a way to reflect on the year we’ve had, and whether we’ve lived this Year of Grace<a href="#fn074" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> as if Christ was “King of the Universe.”<a href="#fn075" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Since I’m preparing for the end of my semester and time abroad, the ending of the year is the first of a lot of endings I’m going to have to be ready for. But, that’s neither here nor there.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today is the last Sunday in the<a href="#fn076" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> year. It’s the feast of Christ the King.<a href="#fn077" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> So, today is the day we celebrate the idea of Christ as the “one who is and who was and who is to come” as a part of the Trinity.</p>
<p>And, we get a reading out of the book of Revelations, which is always nice in a reading. But, today, as the last day of the year, so it’s time that I think about endings. My liturgical year has almost ended, and so the Year of Grace has too. I wonder what Pope Francis will decide next year will be.</p>

<h1 id="rolls"><a href="rolls.html">Rolls</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2018 November 24</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>I’ve realized lately that one of the biggest problems I’m beginning to have in my life is that everything means more than one thing. So, for instance, the title of this post, <a href="rolls.html">“rolls”</a>, could refer to one of two things, both of which are applicable to today, which is odd.</p>
<p>The first and most obvious of these is the food kind. Small little loaves of bread. Today, I decided to try making rolls out of normal bread dough. But, since I measured exactly nothing, I can’t give the recipe.</p>
<p>The oven was set to its hottest temperature, probably 250<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and I kneaded the dough around 5 times over 3ish hours. It baked until crunchy, and was then drizzled with butter.</p>
<p>The other kind of roll is the musical roll. Although wikipedia defines music roll differently, in the Celtic Folk tradition, a roll is a way to break up notes. As you probably know about bagpipes, they can’t play staccato or tongued notes.<a href="#fn082" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> So, to differentiate between a half note and two quarter notes, supplementary notes are played between them. A roll is where you play the note, the note above it, and the note below it, in a quick fashion. There’s more to it than that, especially in terms of spacing, timing, and etc. but that’s a basic<a href="#fn083" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> summary. I worked on making my rolls on the penny whistle<a href="#fn084" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> today.</p>

<h1 id="baking-competition"><a href="baking-competition.html">Baking Competition</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2018 November 23</p>
<h1 id="draft-2-23-november">Draft 2 (23 November)</h1>
<p>As I’ve mentioned time and time again, I enjoy making food, and I enjoy competing. Somehow<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> my coaches throughout life have found out these two facts. This is the first time that a coach has connected the two, however.</p>
<p>So, in a little over 6 weeks,<a href="#fn092" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> I’ll be competing against nominally the entire diving squad, though, like many diving meets, it looks like most people aren’t there to win. Therefore, I need a winning recipe.</p>
<p>Baking competitions are a lot like diving. A perfectly baked cookie will bring in less points than a good cake, because the cake is harder. So, I need a recipe that balances ease, apparent difficulty,<a href="#fn093" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> reproducibility, taste, and appearance. If I didn’t care about the apparent difficulty, I’d likely just make my toffee chip chocolate cookies. But, they seem too easy.</p>
<p>So, I think I’ll try to make <a href="http://catcora.com/recipes/desserts/chocolate-budino/">“Chocolate Budino”</a> or, at least a variation on that recipe. Now, like many people, I found out that youtube<a href="#fn094" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> cooking videos exist, and fell in love with them. They have some interesting tips for how to improve chocolate baked goods, which I’ll likely try to incorporate. But, this is definitely something I shouldn’t put as much internal pressure on myself as I have.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-21-nov">Draft 1 (21 Nov)</h1>
<p>I was informed last night that in a little over a month, I’ll be participating in a baking competition. Now, as I’ve mentioned more than once, I like to make food. I’ve also mentioned that I like competition, so this should be a great thing for me.</p>
<p>But, here comes the hard part: what do I make? My initial idea was to make my chocolate toffee cookies,<a href="#fn095" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> but with a few modifications.</p>
<p>I’ve begun watching youtube food videos, and I understand wholly why people watch them. It’s super entertaining and informative. A few highlights from what I’ve learned is that you can brown butter to add more flavour<a href="#fn096" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> to food, and that you can add espresso powder to chocolate foods to make them taste more deep.</p>
<p>So, I’d planned on browning the butter in the cookies,<a href="#fn097" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> and adding some coffee in as well. However, I also realized that I had chicory coffee at home, and wondered if that might not be a better profile, since it would be a little nuttier.</p>
<p>But, as a wise friend helped me realize “Good cookies are good. Great cookies are good. Awesome cookies are great.” What he meant was that people tend not to discriminate too finely between different levels of cookie. I agreed, and so thought about what else I could make.</p>
<p>Bread was eliminated for much the same reason, because there’s not a huge difference in how a normal person perceives a good to great loaf, and I don’t know that I can make an excellent loaf 100% of the time.<a href="#fn098" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> So, since the challenge began with someone’s banana bread recipe, it was suggested I do that.</p>
<p>But, banana bread for me has always just been a good comfort food. So, like with cookies, it’s not something that can really show how amazing I am at baking.</p>
<p>Then, I remembered that I used to make a recipe called <a href="http://catcora.com/recipes/desserts/chocolate-budino/">“Chocolate Budino.”</a> It’s effectively a chocolate pudding cake, and, when served warm, acts somewhat like a chocolate lava cake. So, as above, I may add in browned butter and espresso to make it more rich, but that seemed like a good way to distinguish myself.</p>
<p>Then the options arose again. I could either make it small, as in a cupcake mold, or large, the size of a 8" cake or so.<a href="#fn099" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> There are advantages and disadvantages to both, so I was not sure which I’ll do.</p>
<p>Then the question became one of serving the cake. I could present it on its own, but that lacks a lot of the cool factor that we love when we bake. So, I decided I’d add some sort of side to the dessert.<a href="#fn0910" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>I like fruit, especially strawberries, so I decided I’d do strawberries on the side. But, then the question becomes how, and I was unsure.</p>
<p>Next, people suggested ice cream. But, I’m trying to showcase my talents, so buying ice cream is out. Making ice cream is a pain, and no-churn ice cream is fake.</p>
<p>So, I realized what I really wanted was something creamy. Hmmm, whipped cream.</p>
<p>I thought about what I tended to associate with chocolate and strawberries, and it’s mint. So, I thought I’d do a fresh mint whipped cream, and serve that with mint and strawberry.</p>
<p>Then the question returned to the size. As another friend pointed out, a cake sized budino would be more easily decorated, as well as looking more professional.<a href="#fn0911" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> So, I realized that I could do a full size cake, cut a nice slice out of it, and have a strawberry on the top, along with a sprig of mint and the cream. I’m still not sure where the cream will go, but I envision it along the side of the cake slice, with the cake topped with some sort of decorative strawberry flower. Maybe the cream could have a slice leaning on it with the mint sprig.</p>
<p>So, in conclusion, I try way too hard.</p>
