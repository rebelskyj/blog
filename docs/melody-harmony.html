<p>First Published: 2025 May 7</p>
<h1 id="draft-3-2025-may-7">Draft 3: 2025 May 7</h1>
<p>The previous drafts have been a lot more meandering than I’m used to lately, and I think that part of the reason is that this post was really amorphous in my mind. Rather than the standard folly, where I have something I know I want to express and find the way to do so, I don’t know if I ever really knew what I was trying to express in the previous drafts. Thankfully, whatever net I cast still managed to bring back something worthwhile to gnaw on.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Like many people, I struggle with imposter syndrome at times. These days, I find it happening almost exclusively in musical realms, and almost entirely when it comes to performance. In many regards, I can acknowledge the feeling as ridiculous. I am not trying to make a living doing music, so of course I am not as good as those who do. I know what would help my ear, and I actively choose not to do it.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>If I was just generally not as great as music as I wanted, I think that I would be more comfortable. However, I do also have some amount of pride<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> in my ability to compose, which I think is where the cognitive dissonance comes in. Every professional composer I’ve spoken to is pretty clear about the necessity of not just being able to hear the harmonies and melodies one writes as they enter the page, but of being able to hear the absent harmonies.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> I can, at least most of the time, relatively accurately hear any individual melodic line in my writing. I can, however, almost never hear the harmonies.</p>
<p>As I write a piece for a dear friend’s wedding, I am finding the absolute limits of my ability to compose without paper. The frets of the guitar are welcoming and encourage certain harmonies and melodies. When I am away from it, though, I can still think about where my fingers and hand will need to be in order to make notes. So, I guess that the takeaway is that I need to accept that I cannot compose without paper, even though that hurts to admit. When composing for choir, I need an active audio playback.</p>
<h1 id="draft-2-2025-may-6">Draft 2: 2025 May 6</h1>
<p>When I was going into my senior year of college, I was debating different career options. Because I was formed for academia<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>, I knew that meant I wanted to go to graduate school next. Being a major in music with a love for composition and chemistry with a love for quantum and analytical, I asked professors what I was missing to be a good applicant to graduate school and generally successful in the industry. When we had visiting musicians, I did the same.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>I don’t remember what I was missing to be a good chemist, other than I think literal information. There was probably something like “be better at your lab notebook”, which I have not really done, but.</p>
<p>To be a successful composer, though, every professor and visiting musician I talked to had the exact same answer: a better ear was essential. Even outside of composing, the different performance based professors I worked with were often shocked at just how bad my pitch memory was.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> My ear is not great, and I have no real desire to do the work essential to training it. Back in college, before I had matured and learned the value of suffering<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>, I was even less willing.</p>
<p>And so, two futures of mine diverged and I took the one of least resistance.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> That spring, I then won a composition award from the music department. As it turns out, even though I do not have an emotional idea of what each interval is, nor can I play 11 notes on a piano and say which one is missing,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> I can still write music that makes the academy happy. Given the general reception to the songs I’ve written since then, I can also write music that makes the average person happy too. The only issue is that I cannot do it without a pencil and paper.</p>
<p>I can improvise lyric if I need to, and can figure out what should come next if given parts of a line. Given a melodic fragment, though, I cannot put the end on a guitar.</p>
<p>As I write a piece for my friend’s wedding, this is coming up constantly. I am nearly positive that what I want is just some scalar walking between different chords, but don’t have an idea in my hands or head how to do that when looking at the fretboard. What little I have been able to do past the moment of inspiration has been because I actively paused and reminded myself what chords were what scalar<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> distances from each other and how I could walk between them. Still, the more I did that, the less the new parts felt like something good.</p>
<p>I’m sure that if and when I go and put the notes in my sheet music editor, I will immediately know what I can do to make the song last forever. I love programmatic music, and especially for something which is meant to be somewhat ambient, having a number of touch points with transitions is great.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> I can easily string a bunch of riffs or licks together, but need to have them first.</p>
<p>What was the point of this folly?</p>
<p>Really mostly me coming to terms with the fact that I don’t intuit musical instruments like I do sheet paper. That does, in my heart of hearts, make me feel like less of a musician, but it probably isn’t something horrible and worthy of despair. I don’t think that I value the skills of composing on an instrument enough to work on them, so I guess it would behoove<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> me to internalize that I am ok with this fact.</p>
<p>I don’t know how I feel about this musing right now, so may revisit it before posting tonight. With two minutes until the end of the hour, I’ll call it here, though. On to the thesis.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-2025-may-6">Draft 1: 2025 May 6</h1>
<p>While writing with my dear friend this morning, they commented that I have not been posting here lately. That’s not incorrect.</p>
<p>Part of me feels like any writing I do here is writing that would otherwise be done on my thesis, which is not totally incorrect. There are only so many thoughts my brain can capture, break in, and pin to the page in a given day. However, I also know that I feel more grounded if I do these follies, and that being grounded lets me capture more thoughts. With that in mind, I’m going to consciously choose to spend the remainder of this working hour<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> writing this. If it doesn’t get me to the point that I want, I’ll try to return to it later.</p>
<p>So, what do I want to say about melody and harmony?</p>
<p>I was talking with a friend this weekend about how we write music. She has a great intuition and ear, and just sings what feels natural. I am so far from that, at least in general.</p>
<p>Sure, most of my songs begin with randomly singing a line or even just a few bars. However, what comes next is that I have to painfully figure out exactly what relative and absolute pitches I sang<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a>. Even then, I only have a single line of music.</p>
<p>What comes next is the part of composition that I have always found easiest: composition on the staff. I am a product of the modern era, and really love having automatic playback. However, if I am away from my computer, I can write more pleasing melodic lines simply by using a staff than I tend to be able to do without the paper in front of me. I don’t know what about me is well trained to write music.</p>
<p>Having written that sentence, I do realize that’s untrue. I have spent a lot of time in my life explicitly and actively studying the melodies that I enjoy or dislike. Almost all of that study has been score study, which means that I have, at the absolute minimum, a good internal intuition of what a melody should look like on the page. Add to that the fact that I have internalized the formal rules that people have written over the ages for melodies that sound good<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a>, and I guess that it should be no surprise that I can quickly jot down something that I like for a single voice.</p>
<p>Harmony is always something that comes later to me, which I attribute in equal parts to my high school choral experience and general love of early music. Both of these sources center melody, and have harmony fall out as a consequence, rather than the reverse, as is more common to the academic composer.</p>
<p>In playing guitar, though, most of what I’ve learned is various folk and folk adjacent<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> songs by looking at chord sheets. I have mostly internalized standard variations on the 145 progression, which is certainly not bad, especially since most of what I write is folk and folk adjacent. Right now, though, I’m trying to write a piece for solo guitar for a friend’s wedding.</p>
<p>In a stroke of inspiration late one night, I found a riff I really liked. The warm light of morning showed me it was just a walk up from A to D in tenths, which made figuring out some next options easy enough. However, because I do so little work with melody on guitar, I find that nothing I’m doing feels particularly natural. I’ve practiced enough scales that I can look at a tab and follow it, but apparently not enough to have internalized it.</p>
<p>So, what does this mean for me?</p>
<p>I want to work on transcribing it, because I feel like it will help with getting the progression through. Right now I feel like what I have is alternating melody and fingerpicked harmony, which is not necessarily a problem. Ideally, though, I think that I’d like there to be more of a melodic line throughout, if only because that is familiar.</p>
<h1 id="draft-0-2025-may-5">Draft 0: 2025 May 5</h1>
<p>I’ve talked a fair amount in the past about how I write music, and especially how I’m writing a piece for a friend’s wedding. While lying in bed late one night, I awoke with inspiration for the hook for the piece I’m going to play this fall. Figuring out what comes next, though, has really been a struggle.</p>
<h1 id="daily-reflection-57">Daily Reflection 5/7</h1>
<ol>
<li><p>Top Priorities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sleep:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Keeping sleep time sacred?</p>
<p>I think so! I saw that it was around 9 pm yesterday so put the computer and whatnot away and went to sleep. When I woke up between 2 and 4, I didn’t get back on my phone, even if I did check my watch for the few notifications it had.</p></li>
<li><p>Good sleep hygiene?</p>
<p>Eh, I was watching youtube in bed last night. Still, didn’t use electronics when woke up in the middle of the night, which is a win in and of itself.</p></li>
<li><p>Sleeping enough?</p>
<p>Yeah! I woke up completely naturally at like 615, and I was unable to keep my eyes closed, so that’s a good sign that I’m finally recovering from my sleep deficit.</p></li>
<li><p>How well rested do I feel?</p>
<p>Decently! I feel pretty good, but I also haven’t left my home yet, so it’s a little hard to know how much of that is that I’m actually well rested and how much is that I haven’t done anything at all.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Feed myself:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I eat breakfast?</p>
<p>Yesterday I had some matzah! Today I um plan to eat by 1030, because that’s where I penciled in food for the day. Given how hungry I am now, though, might not be a bad idea to eat earlier.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I eat a second meal?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I eat dinner?</p>
<p>Yesterday I did! Had pizza.</p></li>
<li><p>Water?</p>
<p>Nowhere near enough. My water bottle is nearly empty, so I really should<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> refill it.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Family:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Am I neglecting any familial obligations?</p>
<p>Nope!</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Movement:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Am I stretching at least 5 minutes per hour of computer time?</p>
<p>I did not stretch for the final like 2 or 3 hours at home, and it was clear that I felt so drained from that fact.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I generally making efforts to be limber?</p>
<p>I stretched this morning before this, and it felt good. Currently trying to do some foot stretches because they still hurt. I’m hoping it’s not stress fractures, but who can say.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Spirituality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Time for prayer?</p>
<p>Nope.</p></li>
<li><p>Prayer?</p>
<p>Nope.</p></li>
<li><p>Time for sacred silence?</p>
<p>Nope.</p></li>
<li><p>Deep breaths?</p>
<p>Generally actually did ok with this one yesterday! Woo one of four.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Secondary Priorities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Thesis/ Ph.D. work:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Keeping up on the writing deadlines?</p>
<p>Eh, I thought that I wanted to do one piece of writing a day and then did not do it yesterday. Still, I am generating a fair amount of content, and there’s absolutely something to be said for the importance of organizing things before I just work on the project. Where the line is between being productive by planning and procrastinating by planning, I’m not completely sure, but I think that I’m still very much on the side of benefiting from planning more.</p>
<p>What are the current things I want to write?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Draft of video one of youtube. Internal/nominal due date: Friday 5/9.</p></li>
<li><p>Science Communication Thesis Chapter Draft. Internal/nominal due date: Friday 5/9.</p></li>
<li><p>RebelFit Introduction Thesis Chapter Draft. Internal/nominal due date: Friday 5/9.</p></li>
<li><p>RebelFit Background Thesis Chapter Draft. Internal/nominal due date: Friday 5/9.</p></li>
<li><p>Publicly Reachable Thesis Chapter Draft. Internal/nominal due date: Friday 5/9. Hmm, can I count the things that I’m doing as an animation for that? Maybe. Still want to do it as a writing chapter, though, in case the boss isn’t keen on the idea.</p></li>
<li><p>RebelFit Results Thesis Chapter Draft. Internal/nominal due date: Friday 5/9.</p></li>
<li><p>Background subtraction got weird, because one of the species didn’t seem to appear in the spectrum. I realized that I’ve been working with a small subset of the spectrum, rather than the entire thing, though, which probably isn’t helping.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Reading the necessary things?</p></li>
<li><p>Making graphs?</p>
<p>Not at all</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Visual depiction of Latin Hypercube</p></li>
<li><p>Visual depiction of Grid Search</p></li>
<li><p>Visual depiction of random search</p></li>
<li><p>Visual depiction of Loomis-Wood Diagrams</p></li>
<li><p>Visual depiction of Spectral Stacking</p></li>
<li><p>Visual depiction of how the fitness of the spectral stacks is really reliant on the graphs being the right height</p></li>
<li><p>I guess that the stuff for intro to quantum video counts here.</p></li>
<li><p>Plots from the actual results of the runs, to make sure that it worked out.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a>.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Organizing citations?</p>
<p>Nope!</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Love:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Taking risks?</p>
<p>Oh! Minorly, actually.</p></li>
<li><p>Making efforts?</p>
<p>Nope</p></li>
<li><p>Showing affection?</p>
<p>Decently!</p></li>
<li><p>Being honest?</p>
<p>Yeah!</p></li>
<li><p>Being open?</p>
<p>Yeah!</p></li>
<li><p>Being appropriately vulnerable?</p>
<p>I think so</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Adjacent to Primary and Secondary:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Typing Practice?</p>
<p>Did so this morning. Lots of work on C and Z, with a little on Q at the very very end.</p></li>
<li><p>Post-its being maintained?</p>
<p>Kind of! Realizing that the way I’m doing post-its might not be ideal. Yesterday I did some pseudo-assigned reading for the writing camp I’m attending, and all of the advice seemed to really stress having a good schedule. I have a nice bulletin board that I have been trying to figure out how to use.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Putting all the notes on it with dates might not be the worst idea! I think that I would need to break the time down into the rest of the week, month, and degree? Have three rows, and then spend some time each morning shifting things around? Maybe? Will see how the motivation takes me.</p></li>
<li><p>Applying to jobs?</p>
<p>Nothing new here from yesterday.</p></li>
<li><p>Reading the things I think could be good?</p>
<p>Nope! Today I actually scheduled time for it, though, which is probably going to be helpful.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Making manim videos?</p>
<p>Nope.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Cleaning?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Office</p>
<p>Made sure it was good before I left yesterday, and will not be in today, so hoping to have it remain good.</p></li>
<li><p>Home</p>
<p>Scheduled time to do so today. I don’t entirely know what it would mean for me to be all caught up with cleaning, but I think that, at the very least, it would involve vacuuming?</p></li>
<li><p>Car</p>
<p>I’m finally going to take the bulletin board out! That’s something.</p></li>
<li><p>Computer</p>
<p>Not really, though not sure if I really need it.</p></li>
<li><p>Other as needed</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>External Obligations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Guitar for wedding?</p>
<p>Scheduled time to transcribe it today, and will finish the musing about it above.</p></li>
<li><p>Travel plans?</p>
<p>Going to call about one hotel just after this.</p></li>
<li><p>Talks for parks?</p>
<p>Two more have been scheduled.</p></li>
<li><p>Other requested talks?</p></li>
<li><p>Talks for conferences?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Tertiary Goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Blogging?</p>
<p>I’m finally going to post this one.</p></li>
<li><p>Reading?</p>
<p>Nope, but I think that part of it is that I’m not reading anything worthwhile right now.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Web Noveling?</p>
<p>No, but I would like to get back into it. Thankfully, the bulletin board<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> has my notes from before giving up.</p></li>
<li><p>Guitar?</p>
<p>Spent a solid few minutes last night working through a few exercises. I’m getting better at reading staff notation for the guitar, which feels really nice, if also more than a little strange.</p></li>
<li><p>Other hobbies?</p>
<p>Not so much.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Quaternary Goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Letter writing</p>
<p>I’m thinking about bringing the books that I want to be reading to my cage, so that I can have more of a reason to visit it. There’s something to be said about scheduling a default day which involves time there. I just really wish that it was open before 830 AM. Tragically, however, it appears that the building is the only space that has them available. Still, the 24/7 library is only like a block away, so if I started the morning there, could always shift to the library with my things later in the morning.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Handwriting/penmanship</p>
<p>Yeah! I have generally been handwriting things, even if I haven’t been doing the loops and lines as much. The letters are getting gradually more even, and in general I think that I’m liking how the penmanship is developing. It is still really weird to be writing in lower case letters, and I do still catch myself returning to block capitals, but.</p></li>
<li><p>Picking a new signature</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="daily-reflection-56">Daily Reflection 5/6</h1>
<ol>
<li><p>Top Priorities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sleep:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Keeping sleep time sacred?</p>
<p>Yeah! I was spending time with a friend last night, so it could have easily spiraled out. Luckily they also respect their rest, and so I was politely encouraged to leave at an appropriate hour. I then went to sleep.</p></li>
<li><p>Good sleep hygiene?</p>
<p>Yeah! Went to sleep! Didn’t do bed rot.</p></li>
<li><p>Sleeping enough?</p>
<p>About another 11 hours last night, which I hope brings me closer to a healthy level of total rest.</p></li>
<li><p>How well rested do I feel?</p>
<p>Generally ok! Still hurts to walk, but that’s really the only thing slowing me down right now.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Feed myself:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I eat breakfast?</p>
<p>Yesterday! Today I’m planning to eat it later.</p>
<p>Oh! I also had a few chocolates this morning. Look at me, feeding myself.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I eat a second meal?</p>
<p>Yesterday! I had dinner with friends.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I eat dinner?</p>
<p>Dinner was two full meals worth, so I’ll count it double.</p></li>
<li><p>Water?</p>
<p>Generally ok? I think that I went through a full two liters of tea yesterday. Today I’m hitting a nice 15 ounces of espresso, which will hopefully both improve my productivity and desire to consume water. I do really prefer cool to cold water over room temperature, which is good for me to know, even if it not particularly actionable. I think that my electrolytes might be generally out of whack lately, which might mean that I shouldn’t be chugging water so much as making sure that I also maybe like eat teaspoons of salt with them?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Family:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Am I neglecting any familial obligations?</p>
<p>Nope! Need to listen to an album sometime this week, but will find space and time for that, I’m sure.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Movement:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Am I stretching at least 5 minutes per hour of computer time?</p>
<p>Generally did ok with this yesterday, though I did ignore the last two or three hours of yesterday’s time. That’s not great, but also like I frame the activity much more as taking a break from work than actually stretching, which is probably wrong, but does explain at least part of it, to me at least.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I generally making efforts to be limber?</p>
<p>Yeah! Even when just sitting down, finding that I want to move more and more is probably good. Also like wow my shoulders are tight, and so did some stretching while walking. That felt nice, and so I’ll probably spend more time today focusing on feet and shoulders, since those are my big areas of note<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a>.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Spirituality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Time for prayer?</p>
<p>Not really, kind of filling my day.</p></li>
<li><p>Prayer?</p>
<p>As a result, not really.</p></li>
<li><p>Time for sacred silence?</p>
<p>Nope! Wow I have done nothing with intentional quiet.</p></li>
<li><p>Deep breaths?</p>
<p>Not really, which I don’t like in the slightest. Maybe I should remind myself with the stretching to also breathe.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Secondary Priorities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Thesis/ Ph.D. work:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Keeping up on the writing deadlines?</p>
<p>What are the current things I want to write? Oh boy are there a lot of them, and I think that the goal is going to be the rebelfit intro/background, since I’m not sure how what I write is going to end up. Mostly going to focus on the whole “this is a list of algorithms I didn’t use” for now.</p>
<p>Yesterday I also said that I wanted to get the new jobs resubmitted. Part of me wants to wait on that, but I think that’s just the part of me that is terrified of success. Going on the list!<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Draft of video one of youtube. Internal/nominal due date: Friday 5/9.</p>
<p>Would also be good to have this? Will spend time on it if I have extra energy after finishing the draft and submitting the jobs.</p></li>
<li><p>Science Communication Thesis Chapter Draft. Internal/nominal due date: Friday 5/9.</p></li>
<li><p>RebelFit Introduction Thesis Chapter Draft. Internal/nominal due date: Friday 5/9.</p></li>
<li><p>RebelFit Background Thesis Chapter Draft. Internal/nominal due date: Friday 5/9.</p>
<p>I really don’t know if I can adequately differentiate this from the above, but hopefully it will clarify itself as I write.</p></li>
<li><p>Publicly Reachable Thesis Chapter Draft. Internal/nominal due date: Friday 5/9. Hmm, can I count the things that I’m doing as an animation for that? Maybe. Still want to do it as a writing chapter, though, in case the boss isn’t keen on the idea.</p></li>
<li><p>RebelFit Results Thesis Chapter Draft. Internal/nominal due date: Friday 5/9.</p></li>

<p>I did this one yesterday! That means that it gets to be removed from the list! Woo!</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Reading the necessary things?</p>
<p>I think that I don’t really need to be reading (read: I should not be reading)<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> I should reorganize the Zotero, but that’s not a high importance or urgency task.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p></li>

</ul></li>
<li><p>Organizing citations?</p>
<p>Hah.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Love:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Taking risks?</p>
<p>Kind of! The very slightest of risk yesterday, and it went well, which is, in retrospect, unsurprising.</p></li>
<li><p>Making efforts?</p>
<p>I think so! At the very least remembering what it means to make efforts.</p></li>
<li><p>Showing affection?</p>
<p>Yeah! I think appropriate amounts no less.</p></li>
<li><p>Being honest?</p>
<p>Generally! It was really weird to write with my friend this morning and find that they were so willing to be helpful.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Being open?</p>
<p>Yeah! I think it’s funny that I separate these two, because one would hope that they’re synonymous, and in my mind they certainly approach it. However, there’s some part of me that reacts to the words differently, so I’ll leave it for now.</p></li>
<li><p>Being appropriately vulnerable?</p>
<p>Yeah!</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Adjacent to Primary and Secondary:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Typing Practice?</p>
<p>Will do now! Lots of work on the letter q. Sadly, the letter C was again an issue, and I even had a few lessons with Z. Generally looks faster than yesterday, which is nice. Perhaps unsurprisingly, focusing on the letter q did mean that my relative accuracy for it went down. I’m sure it’ll rise up again as I keep working, but for now it is somewhat low.</p></li>
<li><p>Post-its being maintained?</p>
<p>I think so! Lost the list of post its from yesterday, which is a little sad and scary, but I’m sure they will turn up when I return to the office.</p></li>
<li><p>Applying to jobs?</p>
<p>Set up two meetings with the career office, one this Thursday so I can ask what should go in the materials and one next week so I can make sure that what I’ve put in them is good!</p></li>
<li><p>Reading the things I think could be good?</p>
<p>Nope!</p></li>
<li><p>Making manim videos?</p>
<p>Nope!</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Cleaning?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Office</p>
<p>Spent a good twenty or so minutes yesterday doing so, felt nice, meant that I could work at my desk. It feels like all the work has disappeared since then. The curse of entropy rears its head again.</p></li>
<li><p>Home</p>
<p>I did not get home until bed time last night, so did not. Today I will try to make time after work!</p></li>
<li><p>Car</p>
<p>none</p></li>
<li><p>Computer</p>
<p>Not really, but will plan to do some today. Oof I get a <strong>lot</strong> of emails that actually require responses.</p></li>
<li><p>Other as needed</p>
<p>Don’t think any right now!</p></li>

<li><p>Web Noveling?</p>
<p>Nope! Thinking about it, and trying to remember where I last left off, though.</p></li>
<li><p>Guitar?</p>
<p>Noodled a bit this morning. As I figure out my schedule, will try to be better at actually practicing.</p></li>
<li><p>Other hobbies?</p>
<p>Going to set aside some time today to work on poetry/song lyric.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Quaternary Goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Letter writing</p>
<p>Nope!</p></li>
<li><p>Handwriting/penmanship</p>
<p>Yeah! I did some work yesterday, and today I’m working on it in the sense of thinking about what I write as I do. I think that I do really want to keep the capital A that I’ve had since college, since I have actively been complimented on it before. I’m not totally sure if it fits the vibe of the other letters that I’m making, though, so that’s something to certainly consider.</p></li>
<li><p>Picking a new signature</p>
<p>None.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="daily-reflection-55">Daily Reflection 5/5</h1>
<ol>
<li><p>Top Priorities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sleep:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Keeping sleep time sacred?</p>
<p>OOf.</p>
<p>I went on a long walk/camping trip. Both because we had early mornings and because no one else in my life loves early bedtimes, I did not do great with that over the Friday and Saturday nights. Last night, however, I think I went to bed or sleep by 8, and I do feel significantly more human.</p></li>
<li><p>Good sleep hygiene?</p>
<p>Generally! I think at least. One plus side of camping, there is maximal incentive to minimize time in sleeping bag when not sleeping.</p></li>
<li><p>Sleeping enough?</p>
<p>Uhhhhh.</p>
<p>No, I don’t think, but also like that may just be physical body muscle repair rather than actual need for sleep.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>How well rested do I feel?</p>
<p>Generally ok. Woke up feeling well rested this morning and ran out of energy halfway to work.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Feed myself:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I eat breakfast?</p>
<p>On it right now! Ate something approximating breakfast on Saturday and Sunday.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I eat a second meal?</p>
<p>On Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, yes!</p></li>
<li><p>Did I eat dinner?</p>
<p>I slept through dinner last night, other wise yesish.</p></li>
<li><p>Water?</p>
<p>Nowhere near enough, but much more than normal.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Family:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Am I neglecting any familial obligations?</p>
<p>I don’t think so! Generally doing ok as far as I can tell.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Movement:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Am I stretching at least 5 minutes per hour of computer time?</p>
<p>Not yesterday, but in general yes. Today I’m absolutely going to try to.</p>
<p>Also, realized that I do tend to do a fair amount of foot stretching while I sit at my desk, especially today, where my feet are in incredible pain.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I generally making efforts to be limber?</p>
<p>With how tight my entire body is right now, absolutely, even though it does feel like I’m tighter than ever before.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Spirituality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Time for prayer?</p>
<p>Yeah! As a group we decided to do the four sets of rosary mysteries during the walk, so 200 Aves.</p></li>
<li><p>Prayer?</p>
<p>As above.</p></li>
<li><p>Time for sacred silence?</p>
<p>Ehhhhhhhh. One plus side of being with a group is that there’s no need for silence. I’ll try to get back into it today, though, because wow I need to feel grounded again.</p></li>
<li><p>Deep breaths?</p>
<p>I think so! Certainly right now as I remember.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Secondary Priorities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Thesis/ Ph.D. work:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Keeping up on the writing deadlines?</p>
<p>I sent in a paper draft and some chapter drafts in last week. What are the current things I want to write?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Draft of video one of youtube. Internal/nominal due date: Friday 5/9.</p></li>
<li><p>Science Communication Thesis Chapter Draft. Internal/nominal due date: Friday 5/9.</p></li>
<li><p>RebelFit Introduction Thesis Chapter Draft. Internal/nominal due date: Friday 5/9.</p></li>
<li><p>RebelFit Background Thesis Chapter Draft. Internal/nominal due date: Friday 5/9.</p></li>
<li><p>Publicly Reachable Thesis Chapter Draft. Internal/nominal due date: Friday 5/9. Hmm, can I count the things that I’m doing as an animation for that? Maybe. Still want to do it as a writing chapter, though, in case the boss isn’t keen on the idea.</p></li>
<li><p>RebelFit Results Thesis Chapter Draft. Internal/nominal due date: Friday 5/9.</p></li>
<li><p>I guess that I should probably also put here: “Do the background species subtraction and resubmit those jobs”, which I will nominally deadline at tomorrow, 5/6, because I think that I should do that today.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Introduction to Spectroscopy, especially rotational spectroscopy, both as classical and quantum framed. Let’s say due 5/7.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Reading the necessary things?</p>
<p>Don’t think that there’s a ton to read other than the spectroscopy and quantum books insofar as they can help me with the videos and background.</p></li>
<li><p>Making graphs?</p>
<p>I need to make a lot of graphs. What, though?<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Visual depiction of Latin Hypercube</p></li>
<li><p>Visual depiction of Grid Search</p></li>
<li><p>Visual depiction of random search<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Visual depiction of Loomis-Wood Diagrams<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Visual depiction of Spectral Stacking<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Visual depiction of how the fitness of the spectral stacks is really reliant on the graphs being the right height</p></li>
<li><p>I guess that the stuff for intro to quantum video counts here.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For now, not going to put deadlines, because don’t really think that any are necessarily essential<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Organizing citations?</p>
<p>I have not made progress on this, but would like to do so today. At the very least, as I read the rotational and quantum books, make sure that their info is in a new zotero folder.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Love:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Taking risks?</p>
<p>Not really any, though I guess that I did try to set up meetings, even if not romantic, with people.</p></li>
<li><p>Making efforts?</p>
<p>As above, though also tried to get myself back into the habit of good/intense<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Showing affection?</p>
<p>Oof, not great here. I forgot to ask any of the people I was with this weekend their thoughts on being called love or beloved, and I forgot to ask them how they feel about physical touch.</p></li>
<li><p>Being honest?</p>
<p>I think so! I tried to not deflect, at least. I did also go to confession for the first time since my mom’s funeral<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a>, which was really hard for reasons I don’t know if I can adequately explain here/want to.</p></li>
<li><p>Being open?</p>
<p>I think so! I was trying to be receptive to others. I had good conversations with strangers during the walk.</p></li>
<li><p>Being appropriately vulnerable?</p>
<p>I don’t think that I was vulnerable appropriately, but it’s a process, not a one off thing, so that’s fine.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Adjacent to Primary and Secondary:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Typing Practice?</p>
<p>Not at all, let’s real quick do that now.</p>
<p>Generally a fair bit slower and less accurate today, but progress was absolutely made. I felt myself becoming smoother with each lesson, and even though it was exclusively p and w lessons, I think that the remaining keys got some good practice. Perhaps unsurprisingly, as I sit better<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a>, I type both faster and more accurately. I should really<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> go back to the external monitor, because wow is the laptop screen too low for me.</p></li>
<li><p>Post-its being maintained?</p>
<p>Will do just after I do my hourly stretch now!</p>
<p>Before next hour I should look up how to stretch foot, because wow it was cramping continuously.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Oof there’s a lot of them, and it’s starting to feel overwhelming. Might want to make more categories than “now”, “not now”, “low priority”, or at the very least figure out what I can do.</p></li>
<li><p>Applying to jobs?</p>
<p>Nope! I will make a note for that though.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Reading the things I think could be good?</p>
<p>Haven’t made much progress there, would like to spend some of tonight or tomorrow doing that, depending on how much work I am able to get done.</p></li>
<li><p>Making manim videos?</p>
<p>Nope! But I did spend a fair amount of time on Friday thinking about how to frame the series and where to start it. I think that “an intuitive explanation of quantum chemistry” feels like a lovely title, assuming that I can make it true. Luckily, someone else in my life expressed that they would love to watch it, not just because they support me, but also because they think that the information could be generally useful.</p>
<p>Also probably want to have something like “market research” meaning looking at the animations and videography I like and dissecting it. I’ll add a post it to the dailies.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Cleaning?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Office</p>
<p>Not yet, but have it on the list to do today. I’ll do after the 10 AM Stretching break.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Home</p>
<p>Negative amounts. I came in from the walk yesterday, dropped everything down, stripped, and collapsed in bed. Good things to do this week for sure though.</p></li>
<li><p>Car</p>
<p>I have camping stuff in the trunk and not camping stuff not in the trunk, so it’s at least more ordered!</p></li>
<li><p>Computer</p>
<p>Nope! Will do so today after the 11am stretch.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Other as needed</p>
<p>Generally I think that’s everything. I guess “go to confession” counts as cleaning the soul!</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>External Obligations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Guitar for wedding?</p>
<p>I have more ideas for the piece, and plan to start transcribing it, because that should help with the composition.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Travel plans?</p>
<p>Nope! Get hotel room is officially high priority, and message each of four groups of friends becomes medium.</p></li>
<li><p>Talks for parks?</p>
<p>Nope! I think that working on the animation for manim would be a good start, though, and at worst I’m comfortable with last year’s slides.</p></li>
<li><p>Other requested talks?</p>
<p>Nope! Oh shoot, I should really work on the “how to read science news” talk that was requested.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Talks for conferences?</p>
<p>As I write and make the graphs I think that I’ll have a lot of this.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Tertiary Goals:<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Blogging?</p>
<p>Wow look at this, which I don’t really know what I’m going to write for the actual text of the post, but I have spent fully 2000 words figuring out the rest of my mind on.</p></li>
<li><p>Reading?</p>
<p>Nope! I did read the very slightest bit of the book on my phone, and I finished the last chapters of the volume of a web novel my brother and I churn through.</p></li>
<li><p>Web Noveling?</p>
<p>Wrote last week’s chapter, have yet to write this week’s.</p></li>
<li><p>Guitar?</p>
<p>Some! Did a little with the whole “learn the actual instrument through the book”, but only the very slightest bit. Probably would be good and healthy and personally helpful for me to schedule time for it.</p></li>
<li><p>Other hobbies?</p>
<p>Nope! I don’t know if I have other hobbies right now, or if I really want them. I guess that I was chatting with someone about song writing over the weekend, so could be good to return to that.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Quaternary Goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Letter writing</p>
<p>Nope! I will figure out where people live as I plan trips to them, though, which is part of the requirement to sending letters.</p></li>
<li><p>Handwriting/penmanship</p>
<p>A little! Yesterday at the cafe we went to before going home, everyone was very entranced with my pens, which was a fun and weird situation.</p></li>
<li><p>Picking a new signature</p>

Really it’s that I’m willing to break meter and flow and anything else much more if it’s for a song, especially if I think that the melody or harmony requires it (probably will be in this musing)<a href="#fnref34" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn38"><p>am I using this as my way of also getting things onto a page so that it’s easier for me when it comes time to post it? Yes, absolutely. Am I also using this as a form of productive procrastination? Yes, absolutely. Is this also incredibly grounding after a long weekend? So absolutely and incredibly yes<a href="#fnref38" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn39"><p>After writing the next two lines, realized that I hadn’t capitalized<a href="#fnref39" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn40"><p>had to look up the term I’ve been using real quick. Saying diagram instead of plot or graph makes more sense to me<a href="#fnref40" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn41"><p>does this need to be capitalized? Who can say?<a href="#fnref41" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn42"><p>that phrasing feels fundamentally wrong in some hard to pin down way<a href="#fnref42" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn43"><p>which I’m going to shift all useful things into after making sure that I have good BibTeX keys for all of them<a href="#fnref43" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn45"><p>oof that’s rough to say<a href="#fnref45" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn47"><p>should here meaning think that I would benefit and enjoy more<a href="#fnref47" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn48"><p>opening a tab for that now, even though it does not get a post it<a href="#fnref48" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn49"><p>read: the note will say figure out what is needed to apply for a lecturing job and make a timeline of when jobs are closing. Ok that’s two notes<a href="#fnref49" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
