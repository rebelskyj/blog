<p>First Published: 2023 August 24</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>A few weeks ago now<a href="#fn001" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I did something that I haven’t done in a while.<a href="#fn002" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> I went to go see a play. The university I attend<a href="#fn003" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> was putting on a production of Ms. Holmes and Ms. Watson.</p>
<p>Now, if you’re anything like me, then your first instinct will be to complain that it’s “Ms.” Watson, not “Dr.” Watson.<a href="#fn004" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> I had that complaint going in, especially since the play was described as a feminist retelling.<a href="#fn005" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> I had<a href="#fn006" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> recently subscribed to a SubStack<a href="#fn007" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> called “Letters from Watson,” which just sends out serialized versions of the Sherlock Holmes short stories. It’s really interesting reading them, especially as someone who reads<a href="#fn008" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> a fair amount of modern serialized fiction. The genre conventions have certainly shifted in the intervening years. However, since this post is a review of the show, rather than the fiction, I digress.</p>
<p>When I arrived, the play promised many of the common staples of modern small work plays. It said that there would be forced audience participation<a href="#fn009" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> and that it was a loving but disrespectful<a href="#fn0010" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> retelling of Arthur Conan Doyle’s work. It was fine.</p>
<p>I’m not sure whether I was just hungry and so not as into the play as normal, but the play lacked a lot of flow to me. When I go to a play that I really enjoy, at least for a moment I forget that what I am watching is a play. At no point during the show did I forget that I was sitting in a crowd, watching a performance. I suppose the fourth wall breaks did add to that feeling.<a href="#fn0011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Still, it was an enjoyable show, and I would happily see it again.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>One of my research group mates is also planning to learn how to use Blender, so now I have an accountability buddy for it. I also think it might be worth finding some set of online tutorials and starting them sooner than later.</p></li>
<li><p>It is beyond hot, which meant that I have been trying to minimize moving as much as possible.</p>
<p>As a direct result, that means that I was not making those big strides.</p></li>
<li><p>I’m now four for four<a href="#fn0012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> posts, for all that I did not remember to post the actual post from yesterday until this morning. I suppose that there’s not much of a way for future readers to see that, though if you were on the post last night, I apologize.</p></li>
<li><p>As a direct result of thinking about math and coding for my entire day yesterday, I did not write too much. According to my logs, I wrote a little under four hundred words of Jeb today. I need to write more, since I’m currently typing tomorrow’s chapter. I’m not sure where I’m trying to go with the story at this exact moment, which I think is part of the issue. My nominal plans for the book say that the next 85 chapters will cover a few<a href="#fn0013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> amount of years in the character’s life. I suppose that sitting and blocking out what I want to happen could be a good idea.</p>
<p>2.3/4+</p></li>
<li><p>Last night I left my laptop at work. Probably as a direct result, I wrote an entire song!<a href="#fn0014" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I did not journal. That’s probably fine.</p></li>
<li><p>I forgot to stretch this morning. Or, equally fairly, it was very hot and I wanted to not do anything.</p></li>
<li><p>I fell asleep at a normal time last night, which was nice. I also woke up before my goal of 6 am today, which was absolutely fantastic.</p></li>
<li><p>I prayed a rosary last night before bed and then listened along to a rosary podcast that a friend recommended on my commute to work today.</p></li>

<h1 id="for-twenty-five"><a href="twenty-five.html">25 for Twenty Five</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 August 23</p>
<h1 id="draft-4-25-june-24">Draft 4: 25 June 24</h1>
<p><a href="twenty-four.html">Last year</a> I tried to do twenty four things between my twenty fourth and twenty fifth birthday. It was a transition away from other, less healthy traditions. I had hoped that setting that goal would have two major effects on my life. First, I had hoped that it would make me more intentional about what I spend my time on. After all, even though I do not know what the number is, I do know that I only have a finite amount of time on this earth. While that has never meant<a href="#fn011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> maximizing the utility of every single fleeting moment, I do find that I prefer to look back on my time when I have been more intentional with it, rather than less.</p>
<p>The second goal, obviously, was to encourage me to try new things. I don’t know how successful, if at all, that goal was. After all, as I have been told many times by far too many people, I am generally a person who is open to trying new things. That’s certainly something I strive to be, at least. That being said, I was at least more aware of things I had done for the first time, at least in my<a href="#fn012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> memory.</p>
<p>So, since I enjoyed the challenge, I decided that I’d try it again. n for n is now being rebranded as my attempt to do more new things each passing calendar year. Since there are an infinite number of activities I can try, that should remain doable, especially if I start lowering my standards.</p>
<p>This post also feels like a good place to reflect on the first quarter century of my life. There are arguments to be made that nothing before I have concrete memory should really count, which I have mixed feelings about, and so will ignore. I’ve gotten a Master’s<a href="#fn013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Degree, graduated a college with a double major, and earned my Eagle Scout. Those seem like sort of the big three in terms of explicit and externally validated life accomplishments, but there are far more things that I’ve done. I have received five of seven sacraments, which I’m beyond grateful for. I’ve also grown a lot, both physically and mentally. Most importantly, while I don’t think that any age<a href="#fn014" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> of previous me would have foreseen me being where I am right now, I also don’t think any of the past mes would be unhappy with it. I am grateful for the time I have had and look forward to the time to come. My fingers are crossed that I will get more than another quarter century on this earth, and I hope to use it well. Maudlin musing aside, there are some things that I want to do in this year. I think that updates for this post will be coming in two forms: things that I have done, and things that I want to do. There were things I wanted to do last year that I kept forgetting about, and so never did.<a href="#fn015" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> With that in mind: Things that I want to do before my quarter century year is gone:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Learn how to weave. I don’t really care if that’s card weaving, tablet weaving,<a href="#fn016" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> floor loom, rigid handle, tapestry weaving, or rug. What’s important to me is that I make the time to make at least a single woven object. Truthfully, getting back into basket weaving would even be good enough for me.</p></li>
<li><p>Take an improv class. It seems fun, and that’s an activity that will be important to me going forward.</p></li>
<li><p>I’d like to learn a polka on the accordion. It seems like the music most associated with the instrument, at least to most, and it’s something that a lot of people I know like.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to record an album. It doesn’t need to be anything incredible, but I want to be able to point to a collection of songs and music<a href="#fn017" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> that I have made and that others can view and access.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to finally learn how to spin yarn. A good friend gifted me with a starting set last year for my birthday, and I never got around to it.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to be able to swim a continuous mile. I don’t know if I ever have been able to before, and it seems like the sort of thing that I would like to be able to do.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Huh, I hadn’t realized some of the things I wanted to do. I don’t know if I’ve ever articulated, to myself, at least, a desire to record an album. Apparently all those people who say that giving yourself space is good are true. Anyways, I have also done new things since turning twenty five!</p>

Also, I’m going to delete some of the text, since it’s really rambly.</p>
<p><a href="twenty-four.html">last year</a> I tried to do twenty four things between my twenty fourth and twenty fifth birthday. I had hoped that setting that goal would have two major effects on my life. First, I had hoped that it would make me more intentional about what I spend my time on. After all, even though I do not know what the number is, I do know that I only have a finite amount of time on this earth. While that has never meant<a href="#fn0153" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a> maximizing the utility of every single fleeting moment, I do find that I prefer to look back on my time when I have been more intentional with it, rather than less.</p>
<p>The second goal, obviously, was to encourage me to try new things. I don’t know how successful, if at all, that goal was. After all, as I have been told many times by far too many people, I am generally a person who is open to trying new things. That’s certainly something I strive to be, at least. That being said, I was at least more aware of things I had done for the first time, at least in my<a href="#fn0154" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a> memory.</p>
<p>So, since I enjoyed the challenge, I decided that I’d try it again. n for n is now being rebranded as my attempt to do more new things each passing calendar year. Since there are an infinite number of activities I can try, that should remain doable, especially if I start lowering my standards.</p>
<p>This post also feels like a good place to reflect on the first quarter century of my life. There are arguments to be made that nothing before I have concrete memory should really count, which I have mixed feelings about, and so will ignore. I’ve gotten a Master’s<a href="#fn0155" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref55" role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a> Degree, graduated a college with a double major, and earned my Eagle Scout. Those seem like sort of the big three in terms of explicit and externally validated life accomplishments, but there are far more things that I’ve done. I have received five of seven sacraments, which I’m beyond grateful for. I’ve also grown a lot, both physically and mentally. Most importantly, while I don’t think that any age<a href="#fn0156" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref56" role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a> of previous me would have foreseen me being where I am right now, I also don’t think any of the past mes would be unhappy with it. I am grateful for the time I have had and look forward to the time to come. My fingers are crossed that I will get more than another quarter century on this earth, and I hope to use it well. Maudlin musing aside, there are some things that I want to do in this year. I think that updates for this post will be coming in two forms: things that I have done, and things that I want to do. There were things I wanted to do last year that I kept forgetting about, and so never did.<a href="#fn0157" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref57" role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a> With that in mind: Things that I want to do before my quarter century year is gone:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Learn how to weave. I don’t really care if that’s card weaving, tablet weaving,<a href="#fn0158" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref58" role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a> floor loom, rigid handle, tapestry weaving, or rug. What’s important to me is that I make the time to make at least a single woven object. Truthfully, getting back into basket weaving would even be good enough for me.</p></li>
<li><p>Take an improv class. It seems fun, and that’s an activity that will be important to me going forward.</p></li>
<li><p>I’d like to learn a polka on the accordion. It seems like the music most associated with the instrument, at least to most, and it’s something that a lot of people I know like.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to record an album. It doesn’t need to be anything incredible, but I want to be able to point to a collection of songs and music<a href="#fn0159" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref59" role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a> that I have made and that others can view and access.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to get back into book binding.<a href="#fn0160" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref60" role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a> I have bound in my life, a single book. It was the sketch book we were required to use in the introductory art class I took. I remember loving the book, and equally importantly, loving the process of making it.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to finally learn how to spin yarn. A good friend gifted me with a starting set last year for my birthday, and I never got around to it.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to be able to swim a continuous mile. I don’t know if I ever have been able to before, and it seems like the sort of thing that I would like to be able to do.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Huh, I hadn’t realized some of the things I wanted to do. I don’t know if I’ve ever articulated, to myself, at least, a desire to record an album. Apparently all those people who say that giving yourself space is good are true. Anyways, I have also done new things since turning twenty five!</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I <a href="pinball.html">competed in a pinball league!</a><a href="#fn0161" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref61" role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a></p></li>

<li><p>I went to a baby shower. I’m sure I’ve been to one sometime before, but I have no recollection of having done so.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>That puts me at a full fifth of the needed new activities, which is nice, especially since I haven’t gone through a full new month. Anyways, I hope to keep both of these lists updated, and hopefully I’ll be able to start moving things from the want to do list to the have done list. I have an awesome set of amazing friends, and I’m beyond grateful that they also do many fantastic things. Relevant to this post, one friend wants to do a good number of the things I want to do as well, which will be nice.</p>
<p>Since this posting is happening the same day that I’m also writing a full blog post, I’ll do my daily reflection there instead.</p>

<h1 id="pinball-part-one"><a href="pinball.html">Pinball Part One</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 August 22</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Last Wednesday I competed in my first ever pinball tournament. I had no clue what it would be like going into it, which may not have been my best choice ever. Nonetheless, I knew a few important facts. ?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Signups were at six pm</p></li>
<li><p>Play started at half six<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>It was sponsored by a local craft brewery</p></li>
<li><p>There was a group play and a finals portion of the night?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As I told my friends going into it, my only real goal in the competition was making it past group play. As it turns out, that was a needlessly pessimistic goal. Everyone makes it into the finals, though not in the same bracket. ? I suppose I should explain the format of the competition. After signups, everyone is<a href="#fn022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> randomly assigned to a group of four.<a href="#fn023" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Each group plays seven of the eight machines at the bar<a href="#fn024" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>, and they record their scores at the end of each three ball set.<a href="#fn025" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> They had a few extra rules, like that you weren’t allowed to play extra balls, which makes complete sense to me in retrospect. While it would not have made a huge difference for me, there were people whose every ball lasted at least five minutes. ? In my group of four, there was me,<a href="#fn026" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> the person who ended up winning the entire competition that night, the girlfriend of the brewery’s rep<a href="#fn027" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>, and a fourth person about as good as I was. Once group play ended, we all turned our slips of paper in to someone, who then ranked us best to worst. One rankings were done, I found out how finals work. When I had signed up, the organizer told me that they make sure it’s not just the absolute best players who get a prize, because that would discourage less good players from attending. ? So, we are all ranked from best to worst. The best four players go to a machine and play single elimination games until there is one person left.<a href="#fn028" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Now, you may be wondering how they pick which machine they go on. The top seed in each set gets to choose their machine.<a href="#fn029" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> I was the top seed of the fourth bracket<a href="#fn0210" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>, which was where they started putting us in groups of three.<a href="#fn0211" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> I chose Godzilla, because it was the most fun machine. At that point, I was incredibly nervous. One of the other people on my machine was the fourth player in my qualifier, who was notably better than me at the Godzilla machine. ?But, I managed to squeak out a win twice, and that meant that I got a prize.?I ended up taking home a four pack of craft beer.<a href="#fn0212" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>?I also took home a tshirt and some stickers, which was nice. I also learned while there that the brewery buys your first<a href="#fn0213" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> beer of the night. ?It was really fun, for all that it lasted much longer than I expected it to. I had really thought that the entire event would be over in two or three hours.?Instead, it took four, and that was apparently a quick tournament as far as their timings go.?I’ll probably do it again, though I’ll make sure to eat dinner first and know that I’ll be late rising the next day. ?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I need to start working on the eclipse talk again. I have some notes from friends who have made them in the past, which should be helpful in making the presentation, as soon as I start to look at them. Truthfully, I’m not entirely sure what the layout of my talk is going to be. Right now, I’m leaning towards building the solar system up from the sun, then the sun and earth, then adding the moon, then adding locks, etc. I don’t know if that’s the best idea, but it’s resonated with me for a week, which is generally a good sign. I should really blog about it sometime.</p></li>
<li><p>I think I made a slight bit of progress against entropy last night, though that was as minimal as it could get. Hopefully I have a little more energy tonight.</p></li>
<li><p>Blogged yesterday! And today! Wow look at me the best</p></li>
<li><p>I’m writing this post first thing in the morning, so no new book content. 1/4+</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote some iambic pentameter last night<a href="#fn0214" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> and a little more today<a href="#fn0215" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>. Maybe that’s a better thing for me to do right now than a whole sonnet. I know that’s an excuse, but any poetry is probably better than no poetry, and I’m mentally exhausted lately.</p></li>
<li><p>I did not journal today, though I meant to. I got a letter from a friend yesterday and a package from a different friend a few days ago. Both of those probably deserve and need responses.</p></li>
<li><p>I stretched last night and this morning, focusing on my hips and shoulders.<a href="#fn0216" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> I also ran on a treadmill yesterday and then swam.<a href="#fn0217" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I went to bed incredibly early last night, which meant I fell asleep somewhat early.</p></li>
<li><p>I should really pray rosaries more. That’s something I need to get back into.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once again, sorry for the rambling nature of the posting. That’s what the site encourages.? ?</p>

<h1 id="universe-in-the-park-part-4"><a href="universe-4.html">Universe in the Park Part 4</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 August 21</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>It’s been a fair minute since the last time that I wrote this blog.?Sorry for that!?Hopefully future delays will happen with far less frequency and length. So, since my last posting, I’ve actually gone on more than one UitP. I’ve given five over the course of three events. They’ve all been incredible, though each in their own way. ?The first one I gave since accidentally giving up was at what I have to assume is the most popular state park in the state. It was scheduled for a Tuesday, and I even still had more than twenty people show up. Apparently in an average year, they get more than three million visitors, which is wild to me. ?The viewing of stars from that talk wasn’t the best I’ve ever had. Unfortunately, the place they recommended I set up was somewhat obscured by trees and the surrounding cliff. That isn’t too much of an issue, though, because historically most of the stars and other celestial bodies I care about seeing are in the upper portion of the sky anyways. It was also beside one of the shelters, which remains lit apparently all night long. That made it a little bit harder to see the stars. A number of my friends made it up to the talk, which was really nice!? After that, I had a brief few days off. That Friday and Saturday, though, I drove up to the northern part of the state. While there, I made a quick detour to drop off my accordion at the<a href="#fn031" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> accordion repair school. They had a museum, which I’ll hopefully find the time to blog about in the future. The talks were hosted by a pair of sister parks, and so they asked me to prepare multiple different presentations. Despite the fact that I’ve been assured each instance of my usual talk is different, I still made a new slide deck.<a href="#fn032" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Since my talks were scheduled during the peak of the Perseid<a href="#fn033" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> meteor shower, I made the new slide deck about that.<a href="#fn034" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Both nights, unfortunately, we were rained out from observing. Even more unfortunately, both nights the rain was completely unforeseen<a href="#fn035" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. The second talk proceeded much like the first, though with far more questions.? There was a camp of high schoolers who were very interested in black holes. As it turns out, one of the counselors for that camp is a rising student in the Astronomy PhD program at my university. It was great to meet him. A whole week went by without doing anything with the talks, since I planned to reuse my slides again this past weekend. At the end of the week, I drove just about as far north, though slightly further east this time, to give another two talks. Both nights had perfectly clear skies, which was fantastic. On the first night, my audience was primarily older people, members of the friends of the state park, which was cool. It was also by far the best prepared audience I’ve ever had. When I asked my standard starting question of “who has heard the term astrochemistry before?” most of them actually raised their hands. That was a surprise, but did mean that I had a number of great questions. After that, we looked at Mizar,<a href="#fn036" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> which I’m going to more and more use as a staple star. It’s really cool that it’s a double star.<a href="#fn037" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> When that talk ended, I went to sleep and woke up, excited for my second talk of the weekend. I took a leisurely drive up another hour north, stopping at a coffee shop, a few bakeries, and a farmer’s market. I also got to<a href="#fn038" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> take a ferry up to the island my next talk was on. It was apparently not advertised at all until five or so minutes before the talk began. Despite that, there were around thirty people at my talk, which is still great. ?Since I made it to the island plenty early, I had time to go swim in another Great Lake.?That was really fun and cool,<a href="#fn039" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> and the water was so clear. It was a really fun trip, for all that the seven hour drive the next day was less than my favorite thing to have ever done. ?I think that I only have one more of these talks scheduled for the summer, which is really weird. It both feels like too many and too few. I do regret not blogging at all during the five talks, but life got in the way.<a href="#fn0310" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> I’m also sorry if this post is far more verbose and rambly than normal. I’m trying out a <a href="4thewords.com">new word processor</a>, and it encourages high word counts.</p>

<h1 id="open-mic-planning"><a href="open-mic-planning.html">Open Mic Planning</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 August 4</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Apologies in advance, this is me using the need to blog as an excuse to plan my next open mic.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, I need to come up with a setlist for <a href="open-mic-7">an open mic</a>. I want to start learning more music as well, so hopefully I can.</p>
<p>Right now, I’m thinking the following songs:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Jonathan Original One<a href="#fn041" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Jonathan Original Three<a href="#fn042" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Ring of Fire<a href="#fn043" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>St. Olav’s Gate<a href="#fn044" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Fisherman’s Wharf<a href="#fn045" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I will follow you into the dark<a href="#fn046" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Maid on the Shore</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, that may be far more or less music than I need. I think that starting with Maid on the Shore makes the most sense, if only because I know that song like the back of my own hand.<a href="#fn047" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> From there, St. Olav’s Gate has a similar love lost, though far more consensually. The love segues into Ring of Fire nicely. From there, doing my first original could be fun, since it’s about heartbreak. My third original could follow that, because that’s the opposite order as last week. Assuming I still have time, I will follow you into the dark is better right now than Fisherman’s Wharf, so I’ll save Fishers for last.</p>
<p>If I still have too much time, Three Fishers is great<a href="#fn048" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> If that still isn’t enough music, I guess 45 Years is always a staple, or I could try Til Forever Falls Apart, depending if the friends I hope to show up do show up.<a href="#fn049" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>I made a lot of figures!<a href="#fn0410" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I made far less progress on entropy. I’m run down after this week. I still cleaned a little, just only slightly more than the mess I made.</p></li>
<li><p>Blogging streak continued.</p></li>
<li><p>I did not write today<a href="#fn0411" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> 2/4+</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote a sonnet last night. I’m beat, so I’ll skip it tonight<a href="#fn0412" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I wrote my first journal entry in the morning. It was weird.</p></li>
<li><p>Shoot! I really need to transcribe the song that I sang to myself.</p></li>
<li><p>I stretched less than before, though it was still nice.</p></li>
<li><p>I am now I think five for five not being in bed early enough this week. Hopefully that trend starts to break.</p></li>
<li><p>I did not do a rosary this morning because I knew that I would be doing one during an adoration hour tonight. That was a mistake, the morning rosary really helps me center my day.</p></li>

<h1 id="lemon-wine-starting-and-ending"><a href="lemon-wine-2.html">Lemon Wine Starting and Ending</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 August 3</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Huh, apparently my post in June about <a href="lemon-wine-2.hmtl">lemon wine</a> never posted. Anyways, it’s finally finished. It was almost certainly ready well before I ended up finishing it off, but I was busy and so gave it some extra time.</p>
<p>In the initial recipe notes, I said that I would dry hop it, which I no longer plan to do. I also said I would use three quarts of lemon juice, which ended up not being true. I saw a video discussing oleo citrum<a href="#fn051" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, and thought about how that could be nice in lemon wine.</p>
<p>So, I ended up peeling six lemons, getting about 4.5 ounces of lemon peel, which I mixed with around that much citric acid, let sit, then blended with the juice from the lemons.<a href="#fn052" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> That mixture went into the reracked lemon wine along with stabilizers. I then waited for a bit as I cleaned kegs and found access to CO2 again.</p>
<p>It is now safely inside of a keg, and has been receiving fantastic reviews. I’m really happy with it, and used the dregs from reracking to pitch the next set of lemon wine, which is my laziest attempt yet.</p>
<p>In short, the new version is just the entire 10 pound bag of sugar that I normally use for both fermenting and backsweetening at the beginning with no inverting. I then filled water, trusted that there would be sufficient nutrient, but repitched yeast just to be safe. It’s fermenting away, so I trust that it will go well as well. If so, I plan to dry hop it.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Made a few figures for the Pleiades<a href="#fn053" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> and added a few lines of text. It’ll need to be done much faster moving forwards.</p></li>
<li><p>I spent ten minutes cleaning this morning and made nice amounts of progress.</p></li>

<li><p>No work on song, whoops. Should really get on this.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretched for a few minutes this morning, following part of my old diving routine.</p></li>
<li><p>So yeah I’m not prioritizing it as well today.</p></li>
<li><p>Did a nice chapel rosary. Then went and did a corporal work of mercy<a href="#fn056" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> and spent time praying at adoration and after. The rosary was far less intentional than yesterday, but growth is almost never straightforward and continuous.</p></li>

<h1 id="open-mic"><a href="open-mic-7.html">Open Mic</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 August 2</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Assuming <a href="open-mic-6.html">my last post about open mics</a> was the last time I went to one,<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I haven’t been in about two months. I’m glad that it’s been long enough that the staple songs I mentioned no longer feel stale. In particular, Maid on the Shore was everyone I polled’s favorite song.</p>
<p>I had planned on it being like most open mics I’ve gone to at the bar, where I have ten minutes, though finishing early is encouraged. Instead, I had fifteen and a generous fifteen at that. It was fun!</p>
<p>I played two original songs.<a href="#fn062" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> I then played Three Fishers, because I love the picking pattern. After that, I made a joke about having time and played The Rose.</p>
<p>By that point I really thought I should be done. I wasn’t which meant I had to start thinking of songs I just know on a deep level. Maid on the Shore is one of those, so I played it.<a href="#fn063" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Even still I had time! So I finished with 45 Years, which was a little low for me where I set my capo. C’est la vie, live and learn.</p>
<p>I’m very excited to go back next week. I had initially planned to play accordion, but my accordion is out of tune sadly. So, assuming I don’t figure out how to fix it yesterday, it looks like another week of guitar. I suppose I should start thinking of a setlist.</p>
<p>Maid on the Shore deserves an encore, I think at least. I’ve only ever done Treaty<a href="#fn064" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> on accordion, but I think it could work on guitar. If not, You Want it Darker maybe? What did the Deep Sea Say is a song my band did, so that could be fun. I Will Follow You Into the Dark is another option, though I’d need to be better at the chords for it. Til Forever Falls Apart also maybe belongs.</p>
<p>My two originals should probably get some more love/playtime too.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I did minimal work on presentations, though I did finish one that’s due Friday.</p></li>
<li><p>I made progress against entropy! It is nice being able to see more of my floor.</p></li>
<li><p>I blogged yesterday and today! wow a streak</p></li>
<li><p>I finished the chapter of Jeb! I’m also starting another. Total this week: 1.4/4+?</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote a poem yesterday and am going to write another after this post.</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote and posted a letter!</p></li>
<li><p>I did not work on my song, though I meant to.</p></li>
<li><p>I stretched this morning!</p></li>
<li><p>I am out too late again, though it was a friend’s birthday, so I feel less than bad about it.</p></li>
<li><p>I did a rosary in the chapel this morning! It was hard to stay focused, but easier than historically, which is nice.</p></li>

<h1 id="monthly-reflection"><a href="reflection-july-23.html">Monthly Reflection</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 August 1</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Woo! Another month passed. It hardly feels real that it’s been a month, but what a month it’s been.</p>
<p>I gave <a href="universe-2.html">three</a> <a href="universe-3.html">talks</a> in state parks, signed up for another four(?), and very recently was reached out to for another two talks this fall about the eclipse! I went to a <a href="conference-2.html">conference</a>. I went to a <a href="mission-trip.html">mission trip</a>. I rediscovered my love of pinball.</p>
<p>I finished the first book in my web serial. I finished the first batch of lemon wine for the summer!<a href="#fn071" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Last night, I made it back to an open mic for the first time in a while.<a href="#fn072" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>So: looking back at my goals.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Make my home clean again and invite a friend over. I have actual time in it this month, so that should be easier.</p>
<p>I don’t know why I thought I was actually at home this past month. By the 19th I had spent a total of four nights in it. It was a packed month. Home is cleaner, though still too cluttered.</p></li>
<li><p>Continue blogging/find a way to do it during my conference. I know I won’t have time for it next Thursday, because I’m volunteering.</p>
<p>I did not blog anywhere near as much as I would have liked to, but I did at least get seven in last month. That’s more than half of June.</p></li>
<li><p>I’d like to exercise more. Ideally daily, but</p>
<p>I exercised nowhere near as much as I in theory want, for all that I don’t feel like I was particularly sedentary. I am far stiffer now than ever before in my life, though, so morning stretching might need to return at a minimum.</p></li>
<li><p>Once again, I’d like to develop a sleep schedule that gives me enough and gets me up early (6am)</p>
<p>Sleep schedule was generally pretty 6am centric. I don’t think all of the breaks were my fault.</p></li>
<li><p>I’d like to make more time for prayer, or at least be more intentional about my prayer</p>
<p>Prayer was not as intentional as I would’ve liked, but it’s a journey.</p></li>
<li><p>I absolutely need to get five chapters ahead, if only because I want to start monetizing.</p>
<p>I am just under four chapters ahead right now. That’s better than nothing.</p></li>
<li><p>Doing some sort of poetry each day seems like a doable goal, if not a low bar.</p>
<p>I wrote maybe three poems.</p></li>
<li><p>I would like to get through my stack of letters<a href="#fn073" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>I think I’m through every letter I meant to write at the start of July. My list is now only five long.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This upcoming month I’m excited for:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>My birthday!</p></li>
<li><p>Giving five talks in state parks</p></li>
<li><p>Sharing lemon wine with friends</p></li>
<li><p>Finishing my stack of letters<a href="#fn074" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Starting to do open mics regularly again</p></li>
<li><p>Staying up on all of my book clubs</p></li>
<li><p>Making progress on research</p></li>
<li><p>Monetizing my story?<a href="#fn075" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Using last month’s goals and the excitement as a way to generate a list of goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Finish my presentation on the Pleiades.<a href="#fn076" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Make my home clean again. It was at the start of the summer, so I know it’s possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Blog more. Last month I wrote 12 percent less<a href="#fn077" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> than in June, which I think is mostly a lack of blogs.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch daily? I think that would be good for me and probably doable. I’ll need to stretch after this, which is less than ideal since it’s already past my bed time, but eh.</p></li>
<li><p>Sleep enough and have a sleep schedule based around waking up no later than 6<a href="#fn078" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Be more intentional about prayer. I think one thing that could help is making an actual commitment to doing a rosary at the chapel before work every day, on the road days that I’m not in Madison, before Mass on Sundays, and during a walk on Saturdays. That’s at least a little bit I can do, though today it will have to come after stretching.</p></li>
<li><p>Get further ahead on the book. In particular, I’d like to set the goal of more than four chapters a week.<a href="#fn079" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> That seems both very doable<a href="#fn0710" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> and helpful to me.</p></li>
<li><p>Write poetry every day. I need to remind myself that I like the way I am more when I do more poetry. I do, so hopefully this works.</p></li>
<li><p>Finish stack of letters, and maybe think of more people to write to? Otherwise, start journaling during my morning time?</p></li>
<li><p>Write a song. I loved premiering my new song last night, and want to do that more.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So, my daily reflections will look like:<a href="#fn0711" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I work on presentations?<a href="#fn0712" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Did I make progress against entropy in my home?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog today/yesterday, depending on when written?<a href="#fn0713" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Did I write book today? How many chapters am I at this week /4+?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write poetry today/yesterday, depending on when written?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a letter/journal today?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I work on a new song?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I prioritize sleep?<a href="#fn0714" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Did I pray the rosary? Was it intentional? Did I prioritize other prayer today as well?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As an example:<a href="#fn0715" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Didn’t do much work, honestly.</p></li>
<li><p>Slight progress against entropy.</p></li>
<li><p>Blogged today, forgot yesterday/got home well past bed time and fought my keg.<a href="#fn0716" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Wrote about half a chapter today .9/4+</p></li>
<li><p>Will write a poem after this</p></li>
<li><p>I did not write a letter or journal today.</p></li>
<li><p>I did not work on a song.</p></li>
<li><p>I will stretch.</p></li>
<li><p>I tried to prioritize sleep today, though I’m not by writing a poem and stretching after this.<a href="#fn0717" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I do not think I’ll be awake through a rosary today.</p></li>

<h1 id="reflecting"><a href="reflection.html">Reflecting</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 July 30</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Prereading note: this is incredibly rambly, because it’s A: being written at the speed of thought, and B: intentionally longer than I generally make musings.<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>So, I’ve realized that I’m feeling really self introspective right now. There are a number of reasons, I’m sure. I’m aware of at least a couple, though.</p>
<p>I took a long nap earlier today. I don’t know whether it’s the exhaustion which requires a nap or the act of napping, but I find that my days spent after a nap are much more inward facing<a href="#fn082" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> than the norm. More than that, though, when I woke from my nap, I realized that nothing on my to do list was actually something I needed to do. That was really freeing, because it let me ask myself whether I actually wanted to do what I had said.</p>
<p>In a number of cases, I did. I wanted to exercise, though I really did not<a href="#fn083" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> want to run. Instead, I found an online yoga class, which was probably a better use of my time.<a href="#fn084" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> I wanted to eat, and so got to be mindful about what I cooked. I did actually want to write a chapter of my book, though I did not want to write two.<a href="#fn085" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> I wanted to write a letter to a friend, and now I’ve written it.</p>
<p>Of course, that is another reason for my introspection. I tend to write my letters first thing in the morning,<a href="#fn086" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> in part because I find that the walk to work helps to recenter me. Without that centering, I was forced to sit and be with my thoughts. I also wrote a short journal for the first time in far, far too long. It was a short musing, but it was good for me to get back into the practice, at least a little.</p>
<p>Also, despite the fact that I went to Mass and then brunch with friends, the rest of my day has been spent in isolation. Especially since the nap somewhat reset my sense of day, I really feel like I’ve been alone this whole day. Interesting, unlike other times that has happened, I do not feel bad about it.<a href="#fn087" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> That’s likely due to the yoga, since staying in is extremely correlated for me at least with not exercising.</p>
<p>And so, with the perfect storm of everything leading me into reflection and nothing preventing me from posting a musing, it seems appropriate to muse on reflecting. This post could equally be about musing, or about the purpose of this blog. I opened my journal entry with “Dear Future Me,” which I know I’ve talked about before as my primary intended audience. By explicitly framing it, though, I realized that there are a number of questions I have for my future self.<a href="#fn088" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>It really made me think about what changes I’ve gone through in my time being explicitly introspective. I’ve come home from a time abroad. For all that it was absolutely a real experience, it does often live in my memory as somewhat of a hazy dream. Even when I read my explicitly chronological musings, I find that I disbelieve the chronology of my time there.</p>
<p>After that, I really began doing research far more legitimately.<a href="#fn089" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> A summer spent bonding with other chemists really made me realize that my passions were best served going into chemistry, rather than<a href="#fn0810" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> music.</p>
<p>I lived through a massive pandemic.<a href="#fn0811" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> During that pandemic, I only just missed the second most destructive storm in American history.<a href="#fn0812" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> I moved to a new place, further from my family than I ever had been for an open ended period of time.<a href="#fn0813" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>I started dating someone seriously for the first time in my life. I started a band. I got a Master’s<a href="#fn0814" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> Degree. I became a PhD candidate.</p>
<p>I have gone through half a dozen journals, changing my penmanship in each. Within those journals are an interesting cross section of my life. Entire courses of notes are contained within them. Other courses are completely removed from them, because I decided to take notes on other platforms.</p>
<p>There are poems and songs aplenty, for all that I don’t ever plan to revisit most of them. I do often think about the fact that I used to be able to write a sonnet a night without too much thought. What happened in my life that I feel busier than I ever have before, despite doing what feels like far less?</p>
<p>In college, I maintained a high GPA while taking overloads of courses, doing sports and music, and having a social life. In graduate school, I no longer take classes, I don’t do any explicit sport or music, and I feel like my social life is nearly nonexistent. But, I do also write a book now, which is gradually becoming less weird for me to claim.</p>
<p>After all of the writing advice that my father tried to instill in me, I stopped writing in a five paragraph essay mode. Of course, that meant that I began having far more paragraph breaks. For a while, I think likely due to the book I was writing, that meant that I would write paragraphs all of three sentences each. As I become<a href="#fn0815" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> more aware of that trend, I’ve tried to buck it.</p>
<p>And yet, what’s the point of everything that I do? In five years, I will likely never revisit my journals. In ten years, I may forget that I ever had a blog. If I have children, my thoughts at a time before they existed might be a comfort to them when I’m gone. Of course, that presumes that my journals will even survive that long.<a href="#fn0816" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>What about the book that I’m writing, though? I enjoy writing it, at least sometimes. I like the nice comments that I get.<a href="#fn0817" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> I know that there’s the whole “not every hobby has to be money producing to be valuable,” but I still sometimes wonder about the value of my book. My journaling and blogging, at least, help me reflect explicitly on what’s going on in my life and hopefully<a href="#fn0818" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> lead me closer to G-d and an eternity in His loving embrace. Writing my book does not make me feel holier,<a href="#fn0819" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> which probably isn’t great. On the other hand, writing my book does make me write more. And, at least<a href="#fn0820" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> 879 people enjoy the book enough to follow it. I suppose that making other’s days brighter is worth a lot.</p>
<p>When I look back at myself this time next year, what will I wish that I spent more time on? I have to imagine that it will be similar things that I wish past me had spent time on now. I wish that I would have practiced art, though I can never really explain why. I wish that I would be better at organizing. And, despite the fact that one of my most common compliments<a href="#fn0821" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> is that I am good at keeping in touch, I wish I did better at that.</p>
<p>So, where does that leave me? I’m not totally sure. What I do know is that, for all the choices past me made that I’m less than thrilled about, I can’t deny that I ended up where I feel like I should be. The people I’ve met throughout this journey remain important to me.</p>
<p>Oh, I just realized I never posted yesterday’s post. Whoops.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I cleaned a bit today, though not as much as I had wanted upon waking. I at least feel more ok with the fact that I have higher priorities right now than decluttering.</p></li>
<li><p>I blogged today and yesterday.</p></li>
<li><p>I did yoga, and will do a self guided stretch after this.</p></li>
<li><p>I went to an improv show last night, so slept in this morning.<a href="#fn0822" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I went to mass, and will plan to pray a rosary as I drift off again</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote two chapters yesterday and another chapter today. That means that I’m four ahead, which means that if<a href="#fn0823" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> I manage to write two tomorrow, I will finally be five ahead.</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote an aggressively bad poem. That is still better than not writing a poem at all, though, so I’ll be happy with it.</p></li>
<li><p>As mentioned, I wrote a letter. It was probably one of my less coherent letters, which is a shame.</p></li>

<h1 id="book-review-of-maus"><a href="book-review-maus.html">Book Review of Maus</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 July 29</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Maus is a book that I feel like I’ve always known existed. Despite that, I do not believe that I read it before this year. I can be honest with myself and admit that a large part of the reason I ended up picking it up is the fact that schools are replacing it in their curricula.</p>
<p>For those who don’t know, Maus is a graphic novel about a man’s experience interviewing his father about surviving the Shoah.<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The Jewish people are represented by mice,<a href="#fn092" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Germans are represented by cats,<a href="#fn093" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> and Poles are represented by pigs.<a href="#fn094" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a><a href="#fn095" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Some see the choice of animal characters as a way to make the horrors seem more abstract, in a way that humans would not. I can’t find anything explicit about why he chose to use animals in the novel, and so I’ll just accept it for the literary device that it is.</p>
<p>Being semi-autobiographical and written in two parts separated by a vast gulf of time, the story drives you to keep turning the page. The first book sets the framing as a man interviewing his father<a href="#fn096" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> about his experiences. The first book covers from before the war until his father is sent to Auschwitz. There is an element of dark humor in the way that dramatic moments within his father’s younger life<a href="#fn097" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> are interjected by the reminder that the book is telling the story of collecting the story.<a href="#fn098" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> After revealing something horrifying about the war, the book will cut back to Art’s father complaining about something minor in the present of the book.</p>
<p>Around two months after reading the collected version, the opening of the second book sticks with me the most. It is a panel with a plethora of labeled numbers. A few jump out immediately: the number of Jews who died in the Shoah, the time since the last book was published, the time since his father died, and the time since his daughter was born. Because the book is now being written also as a memorial to his father, a third timeline is now explicitly introduced to the story.</p>
<p>Book two of Maus is the story of someone realizing that they have lost a relationship with their now dead father while listening to recordings of their interviews about his time in the Shoah. Where the first book emphasized that Art’s father had some ridiculous complaints, the second highlights how much his father was trying to manufacture reasons to see his son. Interjected between scenes of the abject horror of a concentration camp, the framing of a strained relationship of father and son becomes all the more heartbreaking. More, scenes where his father scrimps to save every last piece of money or food become far more reasonable when he discusses how that tendency is one reason<a href="#fn099" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> that he was able to survive the horrors he did.</p>
<p>The book is a fairly quick read. If you haven’t read it, you should. The fact that it is being banned or even restricted is horrifying to me.</p>
<p>I cannot think of anything else to say about the book, if only because I lack the words to express the way that it made me feel. Most books that I read do little to affect me mentally or emotionally. Those that do tend to tug on a single chord of my heart string or line of thought that I can identify and follow and recognize. Maus hit me and continues to hit me like a tidal wave.</p>

<li id="fn091" role="doc-endnote"><p>honestly, this word choice is something that I’m spending a fair amount of consideration on. Holocaust is the most common word used in the American world, and I’m nearly positive that’s the term Spiegelman used within the book.
