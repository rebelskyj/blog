<p>First Published: 2022 July 11</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>I was at a craft circle when I started a bag that I made last week. Apparently my<a href="#fn001" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> ability to crochet got people’s attention, because one of the other members asked if I could help crochet one of their projects shut.</p>
<p>Another, later, messaged me to ask if I would be willing to finish a blanket that a dead friend of theirs started. I still don’t know how to respond to messages like that, but I went with “Yeah! I’d be happy to.” which may be too chipper in retrospect.</p>
<p>But, as it turns out, all the crocheting is done on the blanket. The person who asked knew that the pieces were all done and just needed to be assembled, but thought that also required crochet. Not so. It requires stitching, whip stitches to be exact.</p>
<p>Finishing a join that the friend<a href="#fn002" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> had started was terrifying at the end, because the strip I joined was longer than the one I joined it too. When I finished my second join and found that it was even longer I will admit to a slight panic. But, I realized it’s not totally my fault.</p>
<p>Of the five remaining panels to join<a href="#fn003" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, each is a different length, with up to 6 inches difference. Anyways, I’m having fun practicing my whip stitch and getting better at it!</p>

<h1 id="reflections-on-todays-gospel"><a href="reflections-on-readings-15-ordinary-c-22.html">Reflections on Today’s Gospel</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 July 10</p>
<p>Deuteronomy 30:10 “If only you would heed the voice of the LORD, your God, and keep his commandments and statutes that are written in this book of the law, when you return to the LORD, your God, with all your heart and all your soul,”</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Being totally honest, the homily I listened to was absolutely stunning and I’m just going to steal from it. In the Gospel today, Jesus is confronted by a scholar who asks what the greatest commandment is and how he can follow it.</p>
<p>The priest pointed out that the scribe wants to have neighbor be as restrictive a category as possible. After all, if we have to love everyone like ourselves, where can we keep room in our hearts for hatred? But, Love is not satisfied with restrictions. Love is overwhelming and seeks to exceed.</p>
<p>In such a way, our neighbor is the whole of humanity. We are called to love the Lord with all of ourselves, heart, mind, body, strength and being. It may be incorrect, but I always saw the two parts of this commandment as a what and how. How do we love the Lord? We love the Lord in part by receiving sacraments and praying, obviously. But, we also love the Lord by loving our neighbor.</p>
<p>Anyways, that’s something I’ll have to think about and focus on for the next week. How do I avoid prioritizing my own self-interest above others?</p>

<p>I just reread <a href="dungeons-dragons.html">my<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> last reflection on DnD</a> and it’s funny. Apparently the last I wrote about Dnd was also a one shot hosted by one of my friends.<a href="#fn022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> This was a much smaller group, only the three of us.</p>
<p>As before, we claimed we would end at 9, but really ended at 9:30ish. It was one of the group’s first time playing which is always really interesting. The way that people who aren’t super familair with the mechanics of the game approach it is far different from the way I<a href="#fn023" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> do, often in really positive ways.</p>
<p>We three people met in the City of Arches, where we were hired by a Celf<a href="#fn024" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> to find a chest of his and destroy it. Due to various shenanigans,<a href="#fn025" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> we only got to a reasonable clue for where the chest was likely to be before we ran out of time.</p>
<p>I played a half-elf sorcerer with the gold-dragon sorcerous bloodline. It was funny because the other two PC’s were a high elf and a gold dragonborn, so in a way we were a fun little spectrum. I really enjoyed the session, and I think it’s more likely we continue this into a multi-shot, if only because there are fewer of us.</p>

<p>Pre reading note: I meant to write this last night but was too tired. Whoops.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>I had the opportunity to go to Venite Adoremus, a holy hour of adoration for young adults in my diocese. It was a really great opportunity, and it reminded me that I really should go to adoration more often.</p>
<p>After the hour, there was a social event, which was also really nice. It’s great to meet people around my age.</p>

<p>Yesterday the newest book in a series I<a href="#fn041" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> really enjoy was released. It’s book eleven in the series, and so I prepared in the way I tend to for new additions to a series: I reread the prior books. I found that I again completely misestimated the amount of time it would take me.</p>
<p>It feels like every time I reread a series to prepare for a release I panic at first. “Oh no,” I think, “I’ve started too late. I’m not going to make it to the new book in time.” Then, inevitably, I get to the last book and have to stretch it to the release of the new one.</p>
<p>This pattern was repeated, but it was really fun. I got to see plot threads that I’d missed on prior read-throughs that were picked up and woven in to the latest two books, and I just enjoy the series generally. I tore through the newest book, but I’m listening through it now because I really want to make sure I got all of the content.</p>

<h1 id="on-storms"><a href="storms.html">On Storms</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 July 5</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>I completely forgot about this yesterday,<a href="#fn051" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> but the sky turned the violent yellow-green of a serious storm. It was extra shocking to me because I don’t remember any serious storm last night.</p>
<p>Today, on the other hand, was like walking through soup. It was miserably hot and humid all day, and there’s been a massive storm on the radar. As I was sitting, reflecting on my day, flashes of lightning and distant thunder have been slowly building.</p>
<p>I’m still not sure whether it’s going to hit here badly, but I hope it doesn’t.</p>
<p>Now that I’ve reflected on the direct storm experience, I’d like to talk more about how I feel about storms. In general, I really love the rain. Sure, it’s inconvenient to be caught out in it when I have a backpack or something I don’t want getting wet, but when I don’t, I absolutely love it. The feeling of rain pouring down on me never ceases to brighten what should be a gloomy day.</p>
<p>More than that, though, I love the thunder and lightning. The bright arcs across the sky which illuminate billowing clouds. Sounds so deep and booming that they connect you to the oldest parts of humanity. Plus, it’s super fun to do the whole “Light and sound move at different speeds so calculate how far away it is.”</p>
<p>The times when strike after strike comes in quick succession, so the thunderclaps overlap and you end up with a heavy roar in the air are beautiful.</p>
<p>Anyways, storms are pretty, and that’s all I’ve got today.</p>

<h1 id="solomon-stich"><a href="solomon-crochet.html">Solomon Stich</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 July 4</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today I went to a crafting event with some friends. I knew that I needed a project, but wasn’t sure what to work on. Recently I’ve realized how limiting the way I know how to crochet is.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, most of what I crochet is meant to be warm and thick, so the fabric being so is a plus. But, as these summer months go on, I’m beginning to understand the appeal of looser fabrics. So, I decided to look for an easy project that would force me to use a new stitch.</p>
<p>Enter the Solomon Knot.<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Though I cannot find a reason for the name, it’s functionally just a very loose set of single crochets with skips. It took me a bit to get into the flow of the stitch,<a href="#fn062" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, but now that I have I really enjoy it.</p>
<p>I like how I can decide exactly how large the holes are, though that really adds another level to keeping consistency in my stitch. In the Solomon Stitch, you not only have to keep string tension the same, but also keep the loops you make the same size. I’m making a bag out of this stitch, which I likely won’t want or keep, but I’ve been surprised by myself before.</p>
<p>I’ve really forgotten how much I love crocheting, so it was great to spend time with friends and learn the knot.</p>

<p>Luke 10:20 “Nevertheless, do not rejoice because the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice because your names are written in heaven.”</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today is the 14th Sunday of Ordinary Time. Since I stopped these reflections in the Easter season, it’s kind of strange not having a season I can orient my reflections on.</p>
<p>The last line of the Gospel today is really striking to me. Christ commands his followers to go to the neighboring towns to share the good news.<a href="#fn071" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> They return rejoicing, because they have power over demons now. Christ reorients their joy.</p>
<p>Rather than focusing on the temporal benefits of faith, He reminds us that everything is good only in how it leads us to Heaven. That’s something I need to remind myself more about. A rich prayer life is only worth celebrating in how it orients my will to the Lord’s. Struggles are only damaging in how they damage my trust in Him.</p>
<p>I’m sure there’s a deeper level to today’s readings, but this is all that I have right now.</p>

<h1 id="lemon-wine"><a href="lemon-wine.html">Lemon Wine</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 July 1</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Yesterday I went through the past two months of my life, reflecting a little on what I did. One thing I did which I’m very happy about is that I made my yearly recipe of lemon wine.</p>
<p>Lemon wine is a recipe I have adapted<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> from <a href="skeeterpee.com">here</a>. It’s functionally just lemonade that you add yeast to, but I really enjoy it, and it seems like my peers did as well.</p>
<p>Briefly, I cooked boiled 8 pounds of sugar in water with a heavy splash of lemon juice to hopefully break the dimerized sugar into monomers. From there, I combined it with two quarts of lemon juice with yeast nutrient and water to make 5ish gallons, and added EC-81 yeast. I then measured its density and aerated it 1-2 times a day for the next four days, until the density readings showed it was approximately halfway through fermentation. At that point I added another quart of lemon juice and sealed the container</p>
<p>I then left it alone for 10ish days, at which point it was finished fermenting. I then transferred it off the lees<a href="#fn082" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> and let it sit for about a month. At that point I backsweetened it and bottled it up.</p>
<p>It’s always really fun to share with friends because homemade goods feel better to share than storebought, at least for me.</p>

<h1 id="monthly-reflection"><a href="reflection-june-2022.html">Monthly Reflection</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2022 June 30</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>So... I took a while off from blogging. I could make a lot of excuses, like that it was the end of the semester. If I look at my daily reflections, it somewhat supports that.</p>
<p>Anyways, life updates.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I finished the semester</p></li>
<li><p>I presented at a conference</p></li>
<li><p>I<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> passed my second year exam</p></li>
<li><p>I played at an open mic with a friend</p></li>
<li><p>i think that’s it</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So, looking at my goals for May, and thinking about that into June:</p>
<p>In May:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Blog daily. I still like how it forces me to think about something every day.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a poem a day. I need to do this more and I will try.<a href="#fn092" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Stretch daily. I like how stretching makes me feel, and maybe I’ll be able to touch my toes at the end of the month.</p></li>
<li><p>Listen to BiaY 7 times a week. This feels more aware of my tendency to listen to three or four in a row.</p></li>
<li><p>Finish a draft of the book I’m writing.<a href="#fn093" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> This may be optimistic, but in theory these past two weeks suggest I can do it.</p></li>
<li><p>Practice guitar every day. I’ve been getting better and I really like it.</p></li>
<li><p>In professional news: finish a reasonable draft of my exam. I need to write this, and soon</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Um</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Did not do, gave up one week in.</p></li>
<li><p>...I completely even forgot that was a goal</p></li>
<li><p>I stretched most days, though I’ve recently gotten back out of the habit</p></li>
<li><p>I think I listened 7 times since then</p></li>
<li><p>I apparently kept writing off and on until the 23 of May, getting up to 74382 words, which is still progress</p></li>
<li><p>I practiced most days</p></li>
<li><p>I just presented my exam, so I guess that counts as reasonable</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Now that I don’t have that existential dread over my head,<a href="#fn094" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> I think I’d like to get back into writing. July is apparently Camp NaNoWriMo, so I would really like to try writing here and a short story every day. I’ve already written a few<a href="#fn095" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> of them and I really enjoy the fact that it’s done when I finish writing. I’d like to get back to the LitRPG I was writing, but it’s beginning to feel like an albatross. That transitions nicely into my goals for July:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Blog daily. I kind of completely have no idea what happened in May or June because I have minimal records from them. I don’t like that</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch daily. I liked how I was starting to get more flexible</p></li>
<li><p>Be able to run a 5k. I tried one at reunion, and did not do well</p></li>
<li><p>Listen to BiaY more. I would like to finish at some point, but it’s hard to motivate</p></li>
<li><p>Practice guitar every day. I still like the incremental improvements, and I think I’d like to start shifting more up the fretboard</p></li>
<li><p>Practice accordion at least 2x a week. I just got this and I don’t want it to feel neglected<a href="#fn096" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Write a short story every day. I want to force myself to do more creative writing, especially in short contexts</p></li>
<li><p>Maybe finish the book?</p></li>
<li><p>Finish either of the two songs I’m writing. I started working on a choral setting of Stabat Mater Dolorosa, and I finally put some words and a melody to a chord loop I really like. It would be nice to finish a project</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Ok so having looked at what I thought my updates were, I think there are more. To check, I’m looking at my daily notes for the past two months in far more detail than I did to see why I stopped blogging. Since I stopped blogging I have:<a href="#fn097" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn098" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Seen a lunar eclipse.<a href="#fn099" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Started jamming with a fellow chem grad student</p></li>
<li><p>I think started working out with a fellow groupmate<a href="#fn0910" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Tried recording mental state of the day with my daily reflection.</p></li>
<li><p>Bought a guitar</p></li>
<li><p>Played at an open mic</p></li>
<li><p>Saw my sibling at their institution of higher learning to celebrate a major life milestone</p></li>
<li><p>Joined a new bible study</p></li>
<li><p>Made lemon wine</p></li>
<li><p>Bought new clothes</p></li>
<li><p>Went on group retreat</p></li>
<li><p>Went to a reunion and reconnected with a lot of lovely people</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ran a 5k</p></li>
<li><p>Saw my family</p></li>
<li><p>Got positive reviews of the lemon wine</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Went to a conference</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Met many of my collaborators</p></li>
<li><p>Made new friends</p></li>
<li><p>Tried new food</p></li>
<li><p>Gave a presentation</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Wow that really looks like a lot when I write it all out. Anyways, sorry for rambling, but also not really. I’m excited for the next month of 31 days of writing.</p>
