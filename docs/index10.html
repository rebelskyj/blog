    <h1 id="reflections-on-todays-gospel"><a href="reflections-on-readings-31-ordinary-a-23.html">Reflections on Today’s Gospel</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 November 5</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>It’s been quite a while since my last reflection on the Sunday Mass readings. There are a number of reasons for that, but especially in light of <a href="christian-writing.html">my recent musing where I said I wanted to do more religious writing,</a> spending a musing a week explicitly reflecting on the Bible feels like a good way to practice that. Also, since the last time that I’ve written a reflection on the readings, I finally learned at least one reason I tend to have trouble connecting the first reading and Gospel to the second reading. According to the notes in the edition of the Bible I use most, the Gospel passages were chosen to try to give a relatively full accounting of the different Gospels over the three year sequence. Each of the first readings is chosen to match the Gospel, whether by showing something prophetic Christ did, or simply just by focusing on similar themes. The second readings, however, are not chosen to match the other two. Instead, they are just supposed to trace through the letters, with the goal of giving a good summary of each letter.<a href="#fn001" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Anyways, nearly two hundred and fifty words later, let’s talk about today’s readings. The first reading comes from the book of Malachi, which I’ve now learned is the final of the twelve minor prophets in the Bible, and is the final book before Matthew in almost every translation of the Christian Bible. Malachi, as it turns out, means messenger, which leads some to believe that the name of the book is referencing a title, rather than the given name of the author.</p>
<p>The first reading is a warning to the priests of the Jewish people. It can be read a number of ways, I am certain. However, the choice of Gospel passage makes it clear to me what interpretation we’re expected to take from the reading.</p>
<p>In the Gospel, Christ talks about the way that the Pharisees and scribes of the people are not living in accord with the covenant the Almighty established over His people. Despite that, Christ acknowledges, along with, it seems, every Gospel and New Testament Letter writer, that the Pharisees still have authority over the people of Israel. He says “do and observe all things whatsoever they tell you,”<a href="#fn002" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> before immediately warning the listeners not to act as the Pharisees do.</p>
<p>That is an interesting admonition for me to reflect on. I feel like I tend to have difficulty accepting truths that come from people who I know do not act according to them. If someone tells me that something is healthy and will make me a better person, but does not do it themselves, there is a level of disconnect that I personally struggle to connect through. And yet, as the Gospel points out, this is not a unique or novel situation that I find myself in.</p>
<p>There are two ways that I can read the instruction.<a href="#fn003" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> First, people in authority over us making orders that are within the standards of their authority should generally be obeyed.<a href="#fn004" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> That is, if a boss tells his employees to clean the building, that is his right.<a href="#fn005" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> If the employees do not clean, even if the boss does not, then they are in the wrong.<a href="#fn006" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>The other way that I can understand this is that people can be flawed and recognize that about themselves. I, for instance, know that exercising regularly makes me feel better physically and emotionally. I know the same is true for me about having a regular prayer life. Despite this, I do not exercise regularly, and my prayer life<a href="#fn007" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> needs plenty of work. If someone was feeling generally down about things, I would<a href="#fn008" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> advise them to try praying and exercising more. Even though I do not do it, it’s still good advice.</p>
<p>How much more true can that be for people who have dedicated their lives to studying and interpreting the Word of the Almighty? When a priest or bishop today makes a theological point that I disagree with, I have to recognize that he has gone through significantly more formal theological training than me. Even when what they say is clearly wrong to me, it is still worth the time it takes to understand where they are getting their thoughts from.</p>
<p>In the time that Christ was preaching, the Pharisees were the voice of the people, speaking with Mosaic authority, rather than the priestly power that the Sadducees spoke with.<a href="#fn009" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> It’s interesting that we start today with a reading discussing how the priestly caste will be ignored, and then we see Christ disagreeing with the major opposition to the priestly caste. I’m sure that there’s something deep and profound in the framing, but I can’t find it right now.</p>
<p>The second reading, in stark contrast, is simply a message of evangelization. We, as Catholics, are called to spread the faith to the whole world. I know that I’m not great about doing that, both because I am afraid to evangelize and because I do not live a good Catholic life. There is nothing I can do but try better tomorrow.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write 1700 words for NaNoWriMo? I did, but I don’t really like where the story is going right<a href="#fn0010" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> now. I hope that’ll change tomorrow, but I’m worried it won’t.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb? I finished the chapter that I started last night. It felt either like a really strong chapter or a really weak chapter. My beta reader thought it was an incredibly strong chapter, which is nice. I think I’m a little in my head about the book because I got a review which glowed about how different my writing style is from the normal. I didn’t think I had a distinctive tone, so that was a bit of a shock to me.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? See that? It’s been almost a full week of daily posts, all of which are quadruple digits.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? Oops! I’ll stretch when I post this.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing better at prayer than a rushed and thoughtless rosary? My rosary was incredibly rushed last night, I did a rushed Angelus today, and I struggled to pay attention during Mass. So, all in all, prayer is not going great.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing a good job writing letters to friends? Shoot! I knew I forgot something. Ok, before I stretch, I’ll address the letter that I wrote last night so that I can post it in the morning. Depending how I feel after a few minutes away from the computer, I may also write another letter or at least address an envelope.</p></li>

<li id="fn001" role="doc-endnote"><p>I’m less positive of this claim, but it’s what I remember interpreting the answer as.

<h1 id="on-embroidery"><a href="embroidery.html">On Embroidery</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 November 4</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>I think I mentioned this in my <a href="reflection-october-23.html">last monthly reflection</a>, but last month I went to an embroidery showcase!<a href="#fn011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> It was a really cool experience, in part because i hadn’t realized how diverse the field of embroidery was. I had in my mind an image of just like the way you can add a small pop of color to a piece of clothing as the whole of embroidery.<a href="#fn012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> I was<a href="#fn013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> wrong about that.</p>
<p>The first exhibit<a href="#fn014" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> was a display of temari balls. Temari, as the display informed us, is a Japenese form of embroidery where you make intricate<a href="#fn015" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> designs in a ball filled with rice hulls.<a href="#fn016" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> The designs were beautiful, and they had pieces at every level of finish, beginning with raw rice hulls and ending with a beautiful almost fractal pattern.<a href="#fn017" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>That, of course, was only the first table we saw. There was a lot of free form embroidery, which I had expected. There was also a lot of cross stitch, which I had not realized was considered a part of embroidery. Again, in retrospect, it makes sense that cross stitch would be featured in the Embroidery Guild, if only because the materials and skills cross over so well between the two hobbies.</p>
<p>There was another kind of embroidery that instantly caught my attention, however: counted thread embroidery. Similar to cross stitch, it is worked in a regular fabric<a href="#fn018" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Unsurprisingly, as a child of the digital age,<a href="#fn019" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> the fact that the designs were worked onto grids was fascinating to me. By and large, the designs worked in counted thread embroidery did not rely on different stitches to add texture and design elements, instead relying on color, material, and to a small extent, thickness of worked thread to make their designs.</p>
<p>Anyways, as the four of us walked through the exhibit, we were stopped multiple times by older women who encouraged us to join the guild. It was really sweet, and all of us were tempted, though I think we all decided independently to wait to join until next year. When one of the recruiters found out that we were all getting our Ph. D.s in Chemistry<a href="#fn0110" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>, she was elated and told us that there was a former chemical engineer for the state DNR in the guild. We met her, and we bonded a little bit over the fact that embroidery, especially counted thread embroidery and cross stitch, are very rewarding if you have the sort of mind that a Ph. D. chemist does.<a href="#fn0111" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>In a fun turn of events, she was the one who had set up the temari ball exhibit, and was more than happy to tell us a lot more about the craft. It was fascinating to consider the fact that a lot of the skills I’ve been working to develop as an analytical chemist<a href="#fn0112" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> apply really well to a craft like making a temari ball. The fact that all four of us had taken a course on machining and CAD made the conversation all the more enjoyable.</p>
<p>When we’d gone through all of the art at the show, we stopped by the sale they had. I got a book on designing Bargello patterns, mostly because it was filled with pretty designs and had a section explaining terminology. The others each got their own different books, and we went to a craft store to get supplies.</p>
<p>Since then, I’ve started trying to learn how to embroider. Right now, I’m still new enough that I keep being surprised to learn things. It’s fun, especially since I haven’t been a novice in this way in something for a long time. Dealing with not knowing what questions I should be asking is a skill I’ve let fall a little bit by the wayside, especially during my latest degree, which is meant to focus almost entirely on delving deeply into one or two small questions. Still, it’s something that I really enjoy, especially because I can see the ways that it intersects with so many other skills that I have or want to have at some point. The fact that there will be a social aspect to the craft in the future, as my friends and I join the guild, only adds to that.</p>
<p>For all that the only print resource I have for embroidery is a book on designing Bargello patterns, I do not think that I will likely end up doing too much Bargello work. Bargello embroidery, for those not in the know, is a form of counted thread embroidery based off of some extant art in Bargello, Italy. Its emblematic style<a href="#fn0113" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> is relatively long vertical stitches being used to the exclusion of any other stitch. As a person who personally loves the textural differences that vertical and horizontal lines can make, I don’t think that I’ll be too reliant on the style. That being said, I am also now enough of an adult to do the scales of my different hobbies.<a href="#fn0114" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> I’m perfectly willing to believe that practicing a simple Bargello pattern will become essential for my development as a fiber artist, and I’m willing to grit my teeth and bear it, even if I do hate working on the pattern.<a href="#fn0115" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Thus far, I’ve almost exclusively made a small pattern with gradually increasing numbers of threads, to see the way that the shape differs as it gets thicker. It’s interesting that the object seems shorter when it has more threads, especially since I can pull out a ruler and see that the grid based fabric is, in fact, still a grid. I also find that I generally like the more filled in look more, which makes a fair amount of sense. I’ve always been interested in texture as a part of creative media, but that interest has tended to be more in the way that light reacts<a href="#fn0116" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> with the media being worked. I suppose the canvas I’m stitching into is, in many regards, the media I’m working, but it doesn’t really feel like it, at least right now. There is a part of me that really does enjoy looking at the canvas underneath the thread, which I’m now realizing might be my issue.</p>
<p>I do enjoy negative space in art, but I tend to feel like its use needs to be intentional. Right now, the designs I’m working don’t feel like the sort of art that need explicit negative space. It’s more than plausible that I will change my opinion as I continue into the craft and make more intricate artwork. In fact, I’m almost positive that I will find a use case for nearly every thickness of thread I’ve worked so far. I just don’t know that they’ll be my standard block.</p>
<p>Anyways, this has been a shockingly long and rambling musing. In summary<a href="#fn0117" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>, I went to an embroidery show with friends a few weeks ago. It was filled with really cool art and decorations. I’ve started embroidering and I really enjoy it.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<section class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn011" role="doc-endnote"><p>as it turns out, I did not. Interesting. Ah, I put it in my daily reflection, so unsure why it didn’t count for the month. Anyways.<a href="#fn01ref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn012" role="doc-endnote"><p>it sounds ridiculous to say so now, but I didn’t have anything else to connect the word to then<a href="#fn01ref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn013" role="doc-endnote"><p>obviously, in retrospect<a href="#fn01ref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn014" role="doc-endnote"><p>I feel like that’s the wrong word. Table? unsure<a href="#fn01ref4" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn015" role="doc-endnote"><p>and, relevant for the crowd of physical chemists I went with, very mathematical<a href="#fn01ref5" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn016" role="doc-endnote"><p>traditionally, at least. As I looked up the art elsewhere I saw people using more or less anything you would use as a replacement for filling.<a href="#fn01ref6" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn017" role="doc-endnote"><p>the entire room was filled with signs asking for no photography, which we respected.<a href="#fn01ref7" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn018" role="doc-endnote"><p>wikipedia informs me this is called even weave fabric, and happens when the warp and weft are the same size. I had never considered that a fabric might not be like that always, but I suppose it makes sense.<a href="#fn01ref8" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn019" role="doc-endnote"><p>we’ll ignore the fact that not all of the people I’ve known feel similarly about grid based designs and imagery<a href="#fn01ref9" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0110" role="doc-endnote"><p>which, in retrospect, is probably not the most common answer for a group of four twenty somethings at an event to give, for all that it’s a common one for me<a href="#fn01ref10" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0111" role="doc-endnote"><p>I don’t know how to describe it, but it’s there<a href="#fn01ref11" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0112" role="doc-endnote"><p>e.g. tolerances, how to fix mismeasurements, how to understand what a physical change on one part of an object will do to the rest of it, how to fudge (which is technically slightly different than fixing a mismeasure)<a href="#fn01ref12" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0113" role="doc-endnote"><p>as far as I have been able to ascertain<a href="#fn01ref13" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0114" role="doc-endnote"><p>I think that the common phrase is eat my vegetables, but I happen to enjoy eating vegetables. That is, doing the parts of the hobby which feel less rewarding as a task you have done but which better enable you to achieve what you would like to do in the hobby. I feel like the concept of practice your scales is something I could (should) absolutely go into much more depth over sometime this month, both because I’m realizing as this footnote grows ever longer that I have a lot to say about it, and also because I know I’ll run out of ideas for what to blog about well before December rolls around (to say nothing of the fact that I also would, as of now, at least, like to continue this blog well into December and onward. I’m a little sad when I look at the whole month of October and see only two posts.<a href="#fn01ref14" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0115" role="doc-endnote"><p>not that I think I will. Truthfully the only part of embroidery I haven’t fallen in love with is threading needles, but that just seems like a skill I’ll get better at with practice, especially given how little I see people complaining about it/struggling with it<a href="#fn01ref15" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0116" role="doc-endnote"><p>I tried a number of words, and even though I don’t really like reacts, it’s the best one I could find<a href="#fn01ref16" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0117" role="doc-endnote"><p>for the youth, tl;dr<a href="#fn01ref17" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<p>First Published: 2023 November 3</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Interestingly enough, <a href="writers-block-5.html">one day ago today</a> I sat in front of my computer without any idea what I would blog about. Today I have a slightly different issue. I am going to play games with friends tonight,<a href="#fn021" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and had<a href="#fn022" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> every intention of musing about that experience. However, as I may have mentioned before,<a href="#fn023" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> I’ve started writing on a website which I find very helpful for getting me to write often and well. One feature of the site is that it sets semi-arbitrary goals for me to hit with regards to word count and pace.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, though the overlap is close, it does not always align perfectly with the number of words that I have left to write in a chapter of my web novel. In this case, I finished a longer than standard chapter with 200 or so words in my arbitrary goal.</p>
<p>“But wait,” I hear you<a href="#fn024" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> ask, “why not simply let those remaining words go to waste? Or, even better, why not simply start another chapter?”</p>
<p>To that, I reply,<a href="#fn025" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> “I hate losing progress for work that I’ve begun, and I need a blog post more than I need another chapter of my book at this exact moment.”</p>
<p>Now that I’ve addressed the concerns, I can start writing about the game night I went to tonight. It was a good time! I got to spend time with friends, and I got to play a fun game of chance and skill!<a href="#fn026" class="footnote-ref" id="fn02ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>

<li><p>Did I write 1700 words for NaNoWriMo? Once again, I managed a 2000 word hour with a friend, and did my writing for the day.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb? I did! I finished it and sent it to my beta reader hours before this post. Once again, it felt even easier today than yesterday.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? As you can see, we are now on day four of the streak.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? I did! This morning no less.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing better at prayer than a rushed and thoughtless rosary? Once again, I did the Angelus. Last night’s rosary was pretty rushed.</p></li>

<h1 id="on-christian-writing"><a href="christian-writing.html">On Christian Writing</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 November 2</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p><a href="nanowrimo-5.html">Yesterday</a> I talked about how my goal for this NaNoWriMo is writing something more explicitly Christian. I said that I did not have the time or energy to discuss what that meant in that post, and I do stand by that. However, as I tossed and turned in my bed last night, I thought about what it means to have Christian writing.</p>
<p>Of course, like anything else, the concept exists in a spectrum. At one end is something like the Golden Compass, which is a fiction book meant to mock and denigrate the Church.<a href="#fn031" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> At the other end of the spectrum<a href="#fn032" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> is something like Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger’s <em>Jesus of Nazareth</em>, which is wholly a reflection on the Lord, more a work of theology than of creative writing.<a href="#fn033" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Closer to the areligious side would be the works of Ernest Hemmingway, a devout<a href="#fn034" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Catholic who actively tried to avoid being labeled as such in his writings. My scale may not be absolute, because I don’t know how to rank Tolkein, who created a wold which was completely in line with the Catholic faith, though not meant to be seen allegorically, against Lewis, who wrote didactic tracts on faith with the slimmest metaphor.</p>
<p>Of course, there are plenty of non Christian fictions written by non Christians. As someone who is, however, I wonder about how it should be reflected in my writing. I don’t think that, at this phase of my life, at least, I’m called to be writing pure theology. Certainly I’m not well enough read in the theology or formed in my faith<a href="#fn035" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> to feel as though I have things that need to be said to the world of theologians.</p>
<p>However, I do also have a platform. As of this morning, I have almost twelve hundred followers on my webnovel, and my chapters are read an average of almost 4000 times. With an audience like that, I have to wonder if there’s something I can do to spread the Gospel, if only covertly. Certainly I don’t want to suddenly shift the tone of my book to something explicitly religious, for two reasons.</p>
<p>First, I don’t really love didactic Christian writing as a genre. There are books I’ve read that I really enjoy, but I find that I tend to get too caught up in where the metaphor falls apart. I don’t feel confident enough in my ability to portray nuance to where I think that I could write something without leading people astray.</p>
<p>I also feel like didactic Christian writing tends to only stand when read with that intention.<a href="#fn036" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> That is,<a href="#fn037" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> while I feel like a work of art tends to stand on its own, even when divorced of its context, I find that a lot of didactic writing requires people to be seeking out a book that will lecture them in order to be enjoyable.</p>
<p>That leads to the second concern I have, which is that a blatantly Catholic piece of writing is not what the readers of my book have sought out. Now, there is an argument I respect that people do not always know what they want, but I don’t know if it really holds here. After all, there is almost no cost to people dropping my story if they do not like it, and I don’t know if the morals I’m espousing in the book are particularly non-Christian.</p>
<p>I guess that question is certainly one that I have. To what extent does a work I write become Christian and what are the important parts of a Christian fiction to me?<a href="#fn038" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> There’s something to be said for the idea that a Christian book can be as much about the worldview it espouses as any particular theological point.</p>
<p>In that regard, I think that my web novel is at least somewhat Christian in its view of the world. Violence is not something that the main character idolizes, and his family is filled with people who care deeply for each other. Man made institutions are ultimately fallible, but people by and large are good and motivated by a desire to see the world improve. Without adding a messianic character, I suppose that it’s hard to get too much more Christian, especially given that Christ is<a href="#fn039" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> central to the Christian faith.</p>
<p>I don’t know if this musing did what I wanted it to. I think that I wanted to find a way to write in a way that I considered more Christian, despite never really having considered what that would look like. Instead, I think that I’m walking away from this posting with the idea that I should just be more intentional about the morals I’m espousing implicitly and explicitly in my writing. I don’t think that I’m good enough at writing or thinking to effectively weave in allegory yet, though that is something I should consider.<a href="#fn0310" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write 1700 words for NaNoWriMo? Yes! I did a writing session with a friend, and it was really fun. I think I ended up writing close to 2000 words in that hour, which is near what my maximum WPH has ever been.<a href="#fn0311" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>1726/1700. I continue<a href="#fn0312" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> to grow ahead of schedule.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb? I did! I finished it and sent it to my beta reader before finishing this post. Interestingly, the writing of the chapter was far easier than it felt yesterday. I guess there’s something to be said in consistency, especially in terms of making something which is not inherently difficult seem easier.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? I did! I thought about the post over the day, which was good, and wow we’re now on a three day streak! That’s super cool and I’m excited to continue it further.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? Unlike last night where I forgot, today I was too rushed before leaving home<a href="#fn0313" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>, and I wore dress clothes<a href="#fn0314" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>, so couldn’t really stretch during the day. As with last night, I am again going to stretch after posting this.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing better at prayer than a rushed and thoughtless rosary? I did an Angelus again today around noon, and I went to mass. I also went to mass last night, which I forget if I mentioned or not. I also tried to focus on the rosary last night, but did not do a great job.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing a good job writing letters to friends? I thought about one of the letters I want to write.<a href="#fn0315" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> I did not, however, write the letter or in any other demonstrable way make progress on my goal of writing more letters. I didn’t<a href="#fn0316" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> know if I would be able to today yesterday, though, so I’m ok with this.</p></li>

<h1 id="nanowrimo-2023"><a href="nanowrimo-5.html">NaNoWriMo 2023!</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 November 1</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Well, it’s another November, which means it’s time for another installment in “I<a href="#fn041" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> try my hardest to drive myself insane by doing something related to NaNoWriMo again.” In 2018, when I began this blog<a href="#fn042" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, I did not have the drive to actually write a novel. Instead, I <a href="nanowrimo.html">attempted to add fifty thousand words to my ’blog postings over the course of the month.</a> As I am sure you<a href="#fn043" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> can guess, I was unsuccessful at that mission.</p>
<p>By 2019, I had forgotten about my musings well before November rolled around. 2020 and 2021 likewise passed by me without anything to point at.<a href="#fn044" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> I suppose that there may not actually be all that much from 2021, given that I worked on the same journal from November of 2019<a href="#fn045" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> through August of last year.</p>
<p>Last year, as I certainly remember, I <a href="nanowrimo-2.html">attempted to do NaNoWriMo</a> for what I had a vague idea was my first time ever. As it turns out, I had made an account back in 2011, and had attempted to do NaNoWriMo that year. I, unsurprisingly, failed at that goal.</p>
<p>Last year, however, I was successful, at least in terms of writing 50000 words of fiction and finishing one narrative. The two did not align with each other, as I needed to start a sequel in order to get to the needed word count. Of course, I gave up on the story almost as soon as I could. One year later, I have no interest in revisiting that story.</p>
<p>I also wrote a story this past April, as part of a writing competition for the website where I currently post my ongoing novel.<a href="#fn046" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> I made it to the word count for that book<a href="#fn047" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>, but was tired of writing it by the end of the word count and rushed the ending.</p>
<p>Well, rushed may be a bit of an understatement. The book was set over the course of twelve years. I spent all but fifteen hundred of the words on the first three weeks, then rushed through the next twelve years in the remaining word count. One commenter’s reply was that they were grateful that I did not leave the work unfinished, for all that the ending was incredibly unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>So, that brings us to November. As I mentioned <a href="reflection-october-23.html">yesterday</a>, I am also trying to revive this ’blog and get further ahead in my other book at the same time. Will it work?</p>
<p>Who knows.</p>
<p>Will I burn out before the month is done?</p>
<p>Almost certainly.</p>
<p>Am I still going to ride this train for as long as I can, in hopes that I might be able to salvage a number of words from the situation?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Anyways, the book this year is something I’ve never tried before. I realize I’ve only really written third person limited in the past, so I’m writing this book in first person. Now, whether that’s going to be a good idea is yet to be determined.</p>
<p>The general plot of the book is that there’s an order of vampire fighting werewolf priests in the modern day United States.<a href="#fn048" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> I’m not sure how much of the balance I’ll have between conversation and action, but given that I’ve spent all of today’s content<a href="#fn049" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> on the main character getting ready to meet with the monastery, odds are good that this book will also end up somewhat rushed.</p>
<p>In any case, it’ll be the book I try to write.s I’m hopeful that I can tell a story, and a story with faith, since I haven’t really touched my faith in any of the writing I’ve done.<a href="#fn0410" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> I don’t know if I’ll be able to do it to anyone’s satisfaction, let alone my own, but I have been thinking a fair amount about how to interface my faith and writing.</p>
<p>I feel like that topic deserves far more consideration than I can give it at this point in the night.<a href="#fn0411" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> It’s currently past my bedtime, and I’m well above my word goal for the day.<a href="#fn0412" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write 1700 words for NaNoWriMo? Yes! I did two fifteen minute sprints<a href="#fn0413" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>, 1798/1700. Nice I am 100 words ahead of schedule now.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb? I did! I just finished it, and, as seems always true, it felt much harder to write the chapter at the beginning<a href="#fn0414" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> than it ended up being.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? I am blogging now! Currently working on a streak, which is nice.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch? Shoot! I will do that as soon as I finish here</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing better at prayer than a rushed and thoughtless rosary? I remembered to do an<a href="#fn0415" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> Angelus just before noon, when my alarm went off. Otherwise, I tried to be more mindful about my prayer last night, for all that I don’t know if it really was.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing a good job writing letters to friends? I found my stamps, envelopes, and cards. I also addressed an envelope. That feels like enough for the day, especially since I want to make the letters feel as easy as possible. Tomorrow I’ll try to address another letter, but we’ll see how I’m doing on time.</p></li>

<h1 id="monthly-reflection"><a href="reflection-october-23.html">Monthly Reflection</a></h1>
<p>First Written: 2023 October 3</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Shoot, somehow it’s the end of October. I really feel like I blinked and suddenly the month has completely vanished.<a href="#fn051" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Despite the fact that this month is gone without any blog postings, I still managed to keep up my five a days.<a href="#fn052" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn053" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> As a result, I can still give some highlights for the month.</p>
<p>This past month I:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Went to a fancy PChem banquet in the department</p></li>
<li><p>Gave my last planned talks for a while!</p></li>
<li><p>Talked to children!<a href="#fn054" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Met with a high school friend</p></li>
<li><p>Visited home</p></li>
<li><p>Made ravioli</p></li>
<li><p>Went to Rocky Horror Picture Show!<a href="#fn055" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Went diving for the first time in ages!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s see how that lines up with my things I was excited for from last month’s reflection.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I have a friend staying with me! That’s always exciting.<a href="#fn056" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I’m giving two real talks this week!<a href="#fn057" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>There’s a cool dinner tomorrow I get to go to<a href="#fn058" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I’m going to a school to talk to the kids about careers in STEM!<a href="#fn059" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I’m going to a science fair next week!<a href="#fn0510" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Hey, that’s pretty close to overlap. As always, there are new and exciting things that I did not know I was going to do at the start of the month. I also set my standards incredibly low, which made it easy for the lists to overlap. Let’s see how we did against last month’s goals, though.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Blog more. I somehow blogged less.</p></li>
<li><p>Get ahead on Jeb. I am planning to write another chapter of Jeb right after I write this post, which will technically be slightly ahead.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep my home clean. My home is about as clean now as it was at the start of the month, which is nice. It fell apart in the middle, but I got it back.</p></li>
<li><p>Pray better. I’ve started doing a daily rosary before bed, which is, at the very least, more prayer.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch more. I stretched a total of five times, compared to 6 in September. Whoops.</p></li>
<li><p>Get back into writing letters to friends. I wrote not a single letter. I didn’t even address a letter wow.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So, as expected, I did not do a great job on my goals. But, there’s always the future to improve, and that’s what my goal is now. Next month, I’m excited for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Going home for Thanksgiving</p></li>
<li><p>Doing NaNoWriMo with a friend</p></li>
<li><p>I’m guest teaching a class, which is fun.<a href="#fn0511" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I’m going to a cool discussion about Pascal.<a href="#fn0512" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once again, a fairly small list, though one that’s spaced a little more over the month, which is probably good for me. Goals for the upcoming month:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Write 1700 words a day for my NaNo project. I averaged more than this last year, and I think that I can do it fairly quickly, especially since I even plotted this novel.<a href="#fn0513" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Write a chapter of Jeb every day. So, this is such an outlandish goal, except that I don’t do as many social activities anymore, and I will already be in the swing of writing for NaNoWriMo. If I cut myself off from writing too much more than 1700 words a day for that, the extra creative juice will have to flow somewhere, and it may as well be into Jeb.</p></li>
<li><p>Blog every day. Now, lots of people say that the correct way to build a habit is by picking a single incremental change to your life and implementing it. They’re probably right. Nonetheless, I want to do my best here, rather than simply doing something. I very often have monthly goals of writing more blog posts, and this month I will already have the daily momentum of Jeb and NaNo to keep me blogging.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch every day. There is really nothing about my life that is not improved when I stretch more. Given that I will be hunched over a computer more this upcoming month<a href="#fn0514" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>, it is almost certainly going to be necessary for me to at least stretch my neck, shoulders, and hands. Also, there’s now a club diving team at my school, so I can go diving again. My body was not flexible enough for it last time, but that’s only more reason for me to improve.</p></li>
<li><p>Improve the cleanliness of my home. Last month I raised my standards for what my home should be like. I would like to do that again.</p></li>
<li><p>Pray better. I have gotten to the point that a daily rosary is what I do, but it’s not always<a href="#fn0515" class="footnote-ref" id="fn05ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> particularly mindful. At a minimum, it would be good for me to be better about that.</p></li>
<li><p>Write letters to friends. At a minimum, there are three people I owe a letter to and at least one other person I would like to send a letter to. We’re almost at the time of year that holiday cards become appropriate, and I could consider doing those this year.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This means that I’ll have a daily reflection that looks like:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write 1700 words for NaNoWriMo? /1700</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write a chapter of Jeb?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I stretch?</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing better at prayer than a rushed and thoughtless rosary?</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing a good job writing letters to friends?</p></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="monthly-reflection"><a href="reflection-september-23.html">Monthly Reflection</a></h1>
<p>First Written: 2023 October 1 First Published: 2023 October 31<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Well, another month as flown by, carried away on the wings of time.<a href="#fn062" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> As you<a href="#fn063" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> can tell from the lack of posts lately,<a href="#fn064" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> there are many updates since the last time I talked.</p>
<p>In short, I:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Bound a book with friends!<a href="#fn065" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Made cookies in lab<a href="#fn066" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Did not win a pinball tournament</p></li>
<li><p>Learned blender<a href="#fn067" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Did a graduate recruiting event/weekend</p></li>
<li><p>Went to a workshop on how to effectively give and receive feedback<a href="#fn068" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Had a poker night with friends.</p></li>
<li><p>Saw the relic of St. Jude.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s see once again how that compares to the list that I tried to make about things I was excited for this month.<a href="#fn069" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Running more than five miles again!<a href="#fn0610" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Swimming with friends!<a href="#fn0611" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Giving my final talk in the parks for the season<a href="#fn0612" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Coincidentally, this is also the final of the talk series for any speaker.</p></li>
<li><p>Recording a song!</p></li>
<li><p>Being ready for my upcoming talks</p></li>
<li><p>Maybe<a href="#fn0613" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> give or at least hash out details for me to give my first invited talk at a college I do not attend.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Oof ok. So, I did do the first three of those, but I had already done them by the last reflection. I did not record a song, which is a bit of a shame. As you might guess from the lack of postings lately, last month was not a good month for me in many regards.<a href="#fn0614" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>I’m mostly ready for my upcoming talks, though that’s a brand new development. Yesterday I gave a practice version of the talks to my groupmates, who resoundingly hated the talk. In their defense, I agree with absolutely all of their comments. They mostly boiled down to the fact that a public presentation should be a story that’s somewhat educational. Instead, all that I had was a list of facts.</p>
<p>As a result, I more or less restarted, this time much more focused on collecting pretty images than anything like having a coherent set of facts. After all, it’s far easier to make a coherent set of facts when you have a story than it is to make a story from a set of facts. I don’t think that I have quite enough content yet, though, so I’ll need to think about other ways that I can pad the content. One option is obviously just to add in some more specific facts about what the different kinds of months are?<a href="#fn0615" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>I started hashing out the planning for the talk I’m giving at a real school. It’s for sure happening, which is really nice. I even have a date<a href="#fn0616" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> nailed down, which is great. Other than that, I vaguely know what I’m going to talk about.</p>
<p>So, what am I excited for this month?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I have a friend staying with me! That’s always exciting</p></li>
<li><p>I’m giving two real talks this week!<a href="#fn0617" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>There’s a cool dinner tomorrow I get to go to</p></li>
<li><p>I’m going to a school to talk to the kids about careers in STEM!<a href="#fn0618" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I’m going to a science fair next week!<a href="#fn0619" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, it’s looking like it’ll be a pretty calm month, which will be nice, especially with how hectic my summer was.<a href="#fn0620" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> I’m sure that I did a bad job with my goals last month, but let’s see just how bad.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Finish/make my talk on the eclipses. Hey nice! I did it.</p></li>
<li><p>Make my home clean again. Also did this. Well, at least I made half of my home really clean. It’s the half that anyone has a reason to see, which is good enough.</p></li>
<li><p>Blog more! Objectively, I failed at this goal.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch and exercise more. Technically I did this! I made it to the gym a couple of times with a friend.</p></li>
<li><p>As before, sleep enough, and try to prioritize sleeping earlier. I think I did this. It was hard, especially since I felt like I needed tons more sleep than I should.</p></li>
<li><p>As always, be more intentional about prayer. That was a mixed goal. I started to pray a rosary every night, which is nice. I’m not always praying it well, but that’s progress at least.</p></li>
<li><p>Actually get ahead on my book. Oof. Ok so I did plot out to the end of this arc, but I’m writing so far off of that plan. I’ve been basically writing each chapter as I need it.</p></li>
<li><p>Write more poetry. I did not write any poetry.</p></li>
<li><p>Write or record a song. I don’t think that I did this.</p></li>
<li><p>Write five things I like about myself every day<a href="#fn0621" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>, three things I’m excited for, and ten things I’m grateful for. Well, I gave up on this quickly, but was then told it’s ok that i did.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Goals for this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Blog more. I feel like this is self explanatory</p></li>
<li><p>Get ahead on Jeb. As above.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep my home clean. I like how it looks right now and I like that I can do things in it.</p></li>
<li><p>Pray better. I’ll need to spend some time figuring out exactly what this means.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch more. I need to start taking care of myself.</p></li>
<li><p>Get back into writing letters to friends. I have fallen so hard off of this, and a lot of my friends deserve responses to their letters.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Today I had the opportunity to see the relic of St. Jude.<a href="#fn071" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> It was a beautiful experience, made more so by the fact that I got to sing at a Mass led by the Bishop.<a href="#fn072" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Unfortunately, that did mean that it’s later now than I’d like it to be, and continuing to blog will take more time than I think that I want to spend.</p>

<li><p>I woke before my alarm!</p></li>
<li><p>In addition to praying in front of the relic, going to Mass, and spending some time praying after Mass, I also spent fifteen minutes in silent prayer at the chapel on my walk to work. I forgot how much that really makes my entire day better. I left and just felt better.</p></li>

<h1 id="euchre-tournament"><a href="euchre-tournament.html">Euchre Tournament</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 September 13</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As I mentioned <a href="talk-planning-eclipse-1">yesterday</a>, I have done a number of things during my downtime from blogging. I’d say one of the most fun of them was going to a friend’s euchre tournament last Saturday.<a href="#fn081" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>I think that I knew how to play euchre before the tournament, though I’m not entirely sure if I ever actually did. For those who don’t already know what euchre is, it’s a trick taking game. As far as I’ve ever played it, it has four players.<a href="#fn082" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> The deck is comprised of a standard deck of cards, though with only cards 9 and higher.</p>
<p>Each hand is played in the same way. The dealer passes out five cards to each player, then turns up the top card of the remainder. If someone wants that to be the trump suit, they tell the dealer to pick it up, at which point it becomes trump, and the dealer gets to replace any card in their hand with it.<a href="#fn083" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> From there, the person to the dealer’s left leads with the first trick. If no one tells the dealer to pick it up, the card is discarded and everyone once more goes around and can choose to pick trump. If no one does the second time through, there</p>
<p>Points are scored at the end of each hand. If your team<a href="#fn084" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> took a majority of the tricks<a href="#fn085" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>, you get a point. You get another point for taking all five tricks, and another if the other team called trump. I’m told there’s also a benefit if you choose to go alone, though that was banned at the tournament I went to.</p>
<p>For those who’ve never played a trick taking game, the general rules are that high cards win a trick. Each trick’s suit is the suit that the first player led with<a href="#fn086" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>. However, the trump suit always beats any other suit.</p>
<p>In euchre, you are mandated to play in suit if you can, including if you have trump in your hand. That’s an interesting variation, and one that I’ll have to consider more as I keep playing it. I’m sure that it does things to the strategy that I did not immediately think about.</p>
<p>Euchre also introduces an interesting variation on trump, where the Jack of trump suit becomes the highest value card. The second highest value card is the jack of the other same colored suit.<a href="#fn087" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a><a href="#fn088" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> After that, trump goes down ace, king, queen, 10, 9. It’s kind of fun that jack goes from being a middling card to the best one if and only if the suit is trump. I’m not sure how that impacts when you should have the dealer pick up the card, but I am certain that it will.</p>
<p>Ok so, explanation of euchre out of the way, let’s talk about the tournament. Of the twelve participants, three had played before, and I vaguely knew the rules of trick taking games. I ended up on a team with one of my group mates, and we got absolutely destroyed in the first game. I primarily blame luck for that, as it’s hard to win a game when you don’t have any trump cards in your hand.</p>
<p>The winning teams all rotated, and the second game began. Just as time was running out, we were down one point. I was dealer, and I gave myself<a href="#fn089" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> the ace, queen, and jack of spades, along with the jack of clubs. I also had the nine of clubs, but that doesn’t matter as much. What’s most important is that the card that declared suit was the king of spades.</p>
<p>Obviously, no one else wanted spades to be trump<a href="#fn0810" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> When the choice came to me, I, obviously, took it, and immediately declared that we had taken all five tricks as time was called for the game. That lucky streak remained in our next game, and we ended up winning 2/3 games, which put us in second place.<a href="#fn0811" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> It was a really fun time, and then the hosts took us to their back yard for a fire.</p>
<p>The fire was incredible, especially because they had some fancy fire pit with holes in the bottom, which means that the fire both never suffocated and also burned incredibly hot and fast. The fact that the wood was incredibly dry probably helped that, but it was mesmerizing to watch the flames.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I’m watching a blender tutorial after this, which is progress, if only meta.</p></li>
<li><p>I’m going to clean after the blender tutorial! That is some fighting against entropy.</p></li>
<li><p>Blogging streak is returning, which is great and fun and exciting and happy.</p></li>
<li><p>I actually did stretch, which is wild to me. It felt nice, but wow is my entire body stiff. I should stretch again tonight.</p></li>
<li><p>No exercise today, but I did walk, which is good.</p></li>
<li><p>I went to bed a little late last night, but set the alarm for much later.</p></li>
<li><p>I woke up before my alarm and everything!</p></li>
<li><p>I’m not sure that I’m not sick, so I stayed out of the chapel on purpose today.</p></li>
<li><p>If I write more Jeb today, which I plan to, I will be ahead, which is nice.</p></li>
<li><p>Book remains totally plotted, though I have been considering dropping the total number of chapters from 500 to 400 or even 300. At a rate of three chapters per day, there are a little under two and a half years left in the book. I would rather it be done before then, which either means I need to have fewer chapters or release them faster.<a href="#fn0812" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Every hundred chapters I drop is about two thirds of a year less, which is weird to think about.</p>
<p>In actual reasoning, though, I’m not sure if the third, fourth, and fifth sentences describing the book actually need and deserve their own total arcs.</p></li>
<li><p>No poetry, for all that I should.</p></li>
<li><p>Oh gosh, that’s something I keep forgetting to do. I will work on my album after cleaning and tutorial.</p></li>
<li><p>I just now wrote 5 things I like about myself.</p></li>
<li><p>I just now wrote three things I’m excited for.</p></li>
<li><p>As above, just wrote ten more things I’m grateful for.</p></li>
<li><p>I think that in general I’ve been doing pretty well cultivating joy. I certainly am living more in the present, which is nice.</p></li>

<h1 id="talk-planning-eclipse"><a href="talk-planning-eclipse-1.html">Talk Planning (Eclipse)</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 September 12</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>First, sorry about the sudden radio silence. If I had to blame anything, I would blame the combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Getting suddenly busy<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="spoons-2">getting out of mental space</a>.<a href="#fn092" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Without further ado, though, I do have another talk in<a href="#fn093" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> just over three weeks. With twenty something days to go, it feels like an appropriate time to shift my planning from completely analog to something with a bit more structure. I’ll be giving a talk on the eclipses that are coming up. I think I’ve mentioned on here before<a href="#fn094" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>, but there are four upcoming eclipses on the continental US.<a href="#fn095" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> In order, these are a partial solar eclipse on October 14, a partial lunar eclipse on October 28, a penumbral lunar eclipse on March 25, and a total solar eclipse on April 8 (the first since 2017, and the last until<a href="#fn096" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> 2044).<a href="#fn097" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>There are a lot of ways that I could frame an eclipse talk. Having now talked to a number of people who have materials prepared, I realize that I don’t love most of the ways that they do. Being, as I am<a href="#fn098" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>, myself, the way that I’m choosing to frame the talk is by answering the following questions<a href="#fn099" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>What is an eclipse?<a href="#fn0910" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>How many kinds of eclipse are there?<a href="#fn0911" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Why do eclipses happen?<a href="#fn0912" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Why don’t eclipses happen?<a href="#fn0913" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>How do we know when eclipses will happen?<a href="#fn0914" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>So, really, only one of those questions actually requires any effort from me. My “What is an eclipse” slide<a href="#fn0915" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> will just be a picture of a pretty eclipse with the text definition of one. My “How many kinds” slides or section will be a picture of each kind with a description of how they work.<a href="#fn0916" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> My “Why do they happen” slide will just be “wow we’re truly blessed.” My “How do we know” is also pretty easy. Like, the answer is really just pattern matching,<a href="#fn0917" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> and the hardest part will be not going off on a rant about harmonics (see footnote).</p>
<p>Now, of course, you’ll notice that I did not talk about “Why don’t they happen?”. And that’s because the answer is really hard.</p>
<p>Ok, so, without graphics. The sun exists. That feels like a good place to start. Since we live in a vaguely heliocentric world<a href="#fn0918" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>, everything we care about exists in reference to the sun.</p>
<p>Now, we also know that there is an earth. The Earth, in fact.<a href="#fn0919" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> The Earth moves around the sun.</p>
<p>Now, there are some fun things about that. Imagine if the Earth didn’t rotate at all.<a href="#fn0920" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> We would have one day every year. That would be really bad, I think.<a href="#fn0921" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> Even worse, though, the Earth could be tidally locked, which would mean that, at least in respect to the sun, the earth never rotated. Ope, actually, since we’re saying that the sun is the point of reference, we can thankfully ignore the Earth being stationary from an above inertial reference frame.<a href="#fn0922" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Ok so we have the sun. The sun is orbited by the Earth. If the Earth was tidally locked<a href="#fn0923" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> we would have half the earth bathed in flame and half bathed in ice.<a href="#fn0924" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> Instead, we are lucky that the Earth rotates about four hundred times per rotation around the sun.<a href="#fn0925" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>Now, if the Earth rotated around the sun without a tilt, there would be no seasons.<a href="#fn0926" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> Of course, as we know, we have seasons, which means that we orbit at a tilt. That does then raise the question of what a day is. After all, if you’re on either of the poles, there would be entire calendar days with no apparent change in the location of the sun in the sky.<a href="#fn0927" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> Also, anywhere you are, a fun thing to do is to find that the sun sets later on the days following the longest day of the year than it did on that day. That’s because the day is more than 24 hours during that point. Oh cool, the length of a day can vary by as much as 8 seconds during the course of the earth’s orbit. Hmm, that doesn’t explain why sun sets later.</p>
<p>Oh gosh, it has to do with incident tilt of the earth and therefore apparent amounts of sunlight, along with the fact that the amount of sunshine we get is shifted slightly later, I guess. That is way more than I ever wanted to know and learn, at least for this talk, so I guess I have to leave out the fun fact about how the sun sets later.</p>
<p>Diversions aside, we now have the sun and the earth, which rotates at its tilt across the sun. It’s at this point I want to use blender to animate, because I do not want to hand animate this, and also my ability to animate in python is very limited.<a href="#fn0928" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> But, more importantly, we then add in the moon.</p>
<p>So, first of all, if the moon was the wrong angular size in the sky, we would have much different numbers of eclipses. Shoot, I’ll have to discuss angular size here. Actually, is that the first place to go? I think that the first place I should do it is by going “ok so the moon is actually bound to the earth, rather than the sun, which feels weird.”</p>
<p>The moon is tidally locked to the earth, so we only see one face. If you think of it like a mirror, we can see a full moon when it’s opposite the earth from the sun, and we see a new moon when the moon is between the earth and the sun. This is where the question of why not all eclipses becomes relevant.</p>
<p>So first, we have size on sky. If moon big, more solar eclipses. If moon very big, no chance for total lunar.</p>
<p>But, of course, assumption will start with everything in the same plane, because of course it will. Instead, moon orbits earth at an angle. Because of that, we can only have the intersection at certain times of year. This is really what I want the animation for, because the two dimensional static drawings aren’t totally helpful.</p>
<p>Anyways, a friend also said that if I’m interested in public outreach generally, I should start a youtube channel and post my talks there. It’s not a bad idea, for all that I know it would make me incredibly neurotic.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is progress!</p></li>
<li><p>Kind of fought entropy. I meal prepped this past Sunday, which also did a lot to give me food for the week.</p></li>
<li><p>Terrible at blogging. Whoopse</p></li>
<li><p>I’ve been stretching off and on as parts of me hurt.</p></li>
<li><p>I have been as active as someone rushing from point a to b thoughtlessly is.</p></li>
<li><p>I’ve been trying to prioritize sleep, though I know that I did not on Friday or Saturday.</p></li>
<li><p>I have been needing my alarms to wake up every morning.</p></li>
<li><p>I have not prayed really at all.</p></li>
<li><p>Book chapters are coming out at the last possible moment.</p></li>
<li><p>I mean the net progress is still there I guess.</p></li>
<li><p>Poetry doesn’t happen.</p></li>
<li><p>I played around with the song a little bit, but nothing explicitly for the album.</p></li>
<li><p>I did not do the things I like, excite, or grateful since the last blog post. Tomorrow morning, I guess.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s been a struggle to cultivate being, let alone being joyful.</p></li>

<li id="fn099" role="doc-endnote"><p>probably in this order, but I haven’t decided if that’s true for certain. Thankfully, in order of how much time I feel the need to spend, making figures is an order of magnitude more than making slides is an order of magnitude more than editing slides is an order of magnitude more than preparation. Since I have no intention of spending the rest of my waking hours on preparing figures, I don’t really need to worry about anything else<a href="#fn09ref9" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0910" role="doc-endnote"><p>that’s something I feel like I should be able to readily define. Right now I just have “when heavenly bodies get in each other’s way”<a href="#fn09ref10" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0911" role="doc-endnote"><p>ok so there’s solar and lunar, which is two. There’s partial and total, which applies to both, so four. But then there’s also the fact that the interaction of the sun’s light and the earth and moon results in the earth casting not just an umbral shadow but a penumbral shadow. I don’t know if a partial penumbral eclipse is a meaningful kind, but I still see at least five kinds of eclipse when I quickly google (partial and total solar, partial, total, and penumbral lunar.<a href="#fn09ref11" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0912" role="doc-endnote"><p>lunar eclipses: Earth gets in the way of the sun’s light to the moon.

<li id="fn0913" role="doc-endnote"><p>ok so that’s not really the question, but it like why don’t we have them constantly? Especially once you learn that solar eclipses can only happen during new moons and how new moons form, it is more than a little strange to think about.<a href="#fn09ref13" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0914" role="doc-endnote"><p>because we, like ancient mesopetamia (babylonia? I forget and should absolutely learn by then) are able to track patterns<a href="#fn09ref14" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn0918" role="doc-endnote"><p>I refuse to get into the fact that the sun is moving, because I don’t want it to/don’t think that it should affect eclipses<a href="#fn09ref18" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn0925" role="doc-endnote"><p>the fact that it isn’t totally in line with the orbit around the sun used to mystify me. Now the fact that it lines up so close to nicely and so nicely with the moon shocks me more<a href="#fn09ref25" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn0926" role="doc-endnote"><p>Strictly speaking, the earth’s orbit is not a circle, and so maybe we still would.

Ughhhhhh I don’t want to get into the fact that planets have elliptical orbits, but that’s at least something that I should consider for the future video series (which I’ll talk about at the end of this post, because it’s a great idea that a friend had, especially since more and more it looks like that’s where I want my job to end up<a href="#fn09ref26" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
