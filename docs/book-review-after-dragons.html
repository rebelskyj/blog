<h1 id="book-review-of-after-the-dragons"><a href="book-review-after-dragons.html">Book Review of After the Dragons</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2023 June 8</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>For as much as the books I read tend to fall into the categories of: recommended to me, read already, closely related to a book recommended to me,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I do also read other books. It’s sometimes hard to find books that don’t fit into one of those categories, but that’s just because I am surrounded by a number of book-lovers with distinct tastes and have a very low bar for what counts as closely related. That being said, I’m usually glad when I do.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I went to the library to check out a copy of Art Spiegelman’s <em>Maus.</em><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> While I was there, I walked by the table of new arrivals.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> I saw a book called “After the Dragons,” by Cynthia Zhang, and decided to give it a read.</p>
<p>It’s squarely in the realm of Magic Realism<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>, which is a genre that I think more people need to be exposed to. Magic Realism is subtly different than Urban Fantasy, though the distinction is important. In Urban Fantasy, Magic is at least on some level hidden from the average person, or was.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Some popular examples of Urban Fantasy are the Harry Potter series, Lilo and Stitch,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Twilight, and Dracula.</p>
<p>Magic Realism, by contrast, is where we have our existing society, but Magic is just there. I keep seeing claims that it originated in South America, but I’ve seen plenty of examples of it in Russian literature. As an example, I would argue that Kafka’s Metamorphisis is one, though there are newer ones for sure. Disney’s Encanto or Turning Red would also be clear examples of the genre. I would also argue that Frankenstein fits better into this genre. A lot of Stephen King’s works fit here as well.</p>
<p>Anyways, four hundred words of exposition later, After the Dragons takes place in China, where dragons are slowly going extinct due to man-made pollution.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> We follow a Chinese-American here on a study-abroad equivalent<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> who slowly falls in love with a Chinese man who has a degenerative illness. Dragons are how the two meet and bond, as the student wants to study them, and the Chinese man takes care of feral dragons that he finds on the streets.</p>
<p>It was a quick read, but an enjoyable one. There were some lines in the book that screamed propaganda to me, but I’ve been told I’m overly sensitive to that. Because the book was so short, though, I felt like there were a lot of portions that I would have preferred be fleshed out more. I would still recommend someone read it, though I wouldn’t read it again without a real<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> reason.</p>
<p>Immediate edit: Whoops! I published this before realizing I didn’t do my daily reflection.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Minimal progress towards friends coming over, though I’m ok with that right now.</p></li>
<li><p>Wrote a blog post about one of the books I’ve read!<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Did not exercise, but actively chose to do so</p></li>
<li><p>Slept in again, though I am waking up well before six tomorrow.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>I’m about to go pray a rosary.</p></li>
<li><p>I’m now about a third to a half of a chapter ahead! That’s technically progress, though I would love if there was more.</p></li>
<li><p>After my rosary, if I still have energy, I’ll work on the song a touch.</p></li>
<li><p>I forgot to post the letter yesterday, but I’ve started drafting the next one in my head!</p></li>
