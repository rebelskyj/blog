<p>First Published: 2023 December12</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Wow, five years ago I was posting my theatre final for my blog post. It’s really interesting to me how much my view of this blog has changed since starting it. As Hanukkah starts to wind down,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and the semester<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> does as well, I think it could be fun to explicitly muse on why I’m doing these musings, and why I started initially.</p>
<p>As the header for this site implies, one major reason that I write my blog is because my father does. He had his own reasons for wanting to blog, which, if I remember correctly, include wanting to leave us a legacy and wanting a space to answer questions that he frequently received. Another reason that I initially began this blog was because I wanted my friends and family to be able to keep up with my exploits and adventures while I studied abroad. I think that the only other reason that matters is that I was in a class on diaries which assigned us to keep a diary. I argued<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> that blogging is a modern form of diary, one which comes with its own benefits and drawbacks.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Of course, I, like every writer under a commitment, then struggled to find something to write about literally every day.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> One way that I got around this<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> was by posting my different writing assignments to the blog. In some regards, I’ve kept up with that, however slightly. These days, I tend to use the platform to iterate on ideas, but don’t actually put the text of my assignments or other writing into the blog.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>One reason is that I don’t know if I want this blog to be widely attached to my name. I’m going to keep it up indefinitely, but that doesn’t mean that I want it to be easily accessed. Right now, it’s actively not SEO<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> optimized, and there’s no direct link from the main site,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> or even my subsection<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> of the site. It is linked on my GitHub, which a colleague pointed out. Still, I don’t think that’s too much of an issue.</p>
<p>However, the more that direct text is copied between the blog and other sources, the more that they can be tied together. My writing tumblr, for instance, is nominally anonymous. I’d really rather all of my writing stay, at least in theory, separated from my personal self.</p>
<p>Other than that, though, as I keep doing funded research, I am more and more concerned about accidentally leaking private research information or causing our research to get scooped. That’s probably a baseless concern, but it’s easier to stay in a habit of not leaking data than to have to develop it after graduate school.</p>
<p>So, what’s the point of the musings these days?</p>
<p>In part, it’s about holding myself accountable. The daily reflections I post force me to, if only for a second, go through my mental checklist of the day and see how well I did. More than that, though, the daily reflections remind me that I need to do things every day. The number of times that I’ve been getting ready to go to sleep, read something like “did I drink water today?” and then drunk water<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> is almost embarrassingly high.</p>
<p>One portion of the original inspiration that still remains is that I do still want to be more like my father in more ways. He has<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> a sign with the quote “no matter how tall I grow, I still look up to my father”<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>. I know that he has his own personal relationship to the saying, and that I have mine. Honestly, I’m not sure if I’ve ever told him that the sign has meaning to me.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> Writing this lets me feel connected to him in a new way, which is really nice.</p>
<p>A major reason that has evolved from the original inspiration is keeping track of my life. I originally made the blog so that friends and family could theoretically feel like they knew how my hours passed. Looking back on the posts, though, I am reminded of my own memories there, especially the ones that I did not explicitly record.</p>
<p>Not finally but finally for my reflection tonight, I find that writing these musings makes me more reflective. I’ve talked a lot about how I want to improve at craft, but, as I mentioned <a href="conclusions.html">recently,</a> I also struggle with expressing why I have goals or arguments. I want to be better at the craft of writing so that I can better communicate in whatever endeavors I choose to spend my days following. I want to be better at communicating because I do, deep down, believe that I have insights and ideas that could help the world and lead people to Christ. Honing my craft allows me to be more effective at spreading whatever small scale message I want to spread, in addition to the larger meta goal.</p>
<p>For all that<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>, being reflective is an end in itself. As my recent posts have demonstrated<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>, my thoughts on a subject can and often do change rapidly and wildly if I take the time to verbalize<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> them. In basically every post I’ve revised recently, the later drafts are not only more polished, but they argue something different, sometimes even contradictory to the earlier drafts. I find that my ability to sort through my thoughts is improving. Even if it were not, though, the fact that I am thinking more deeply is a goal in and of itself.</p>
<p>So, while I don’t think that I’m going to get back into the habit of posting drafts of my class assignments to this blog<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>, I do still intend to keep writing these posts. What has this musing done to help with my goals of: being like my father, being more reflective, keeping track of my time, and keeping myself accountable?<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> I don’t really know. Today was an uneventfully eventful day<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>, and I<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> don’t want to make my private life quite this public yet, and didn’t touch on any of the events that happened. I thought again about why I’m keeping up this blog, which is something that I do at least monthly, and so might not have needed to spend an entire post on.</p>
<p>Oh, I did just think of another reason that I’m writing this blog still. As I’ve mentioned a few times, there’s a site I use to motivate my writing these days. It encourages putting out a large quantity of words, and a daily blog post is a way for me to generate more words.</p>
<p>Sorry, aside aside<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>, I do think that reflecting explicitly is still good, especially since I think that this might be the first time that I actually explicitly stated why I want to get better at writing. And, of course, there’s going to be the daily reflection at the end, which will hopefully help with the final portions.</p>
<p>Daily Reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I embroider today? Something I embroidered was received.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I play guitar today? Still in its case from last night, will do so after I post this.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I practice touch typing today? I made it through c, if only for a lesson. H did not go well enough, and I was once more forced back last night. I do find that I’m doing better and better at using my middle finger for c, for all that<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> I’m still not quite at perfect finger use for each letter. I’m not onto G, which is fun</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Reading</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have I made progress on my Currently Reading Shelf? I officially started one of the audiobooks, and it really is making it a lot easier to read. I don’t know why I have a mental block against reading physically right now, but it’s better to find a workaround than to suffer.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I read the book on craft? I brought it with me during my far too long drive today, expecting to have to wait outside my car. I didn’t have to, and so didn’t end up reading it.</p></li>
<li><p>Have I read the library books? Nope!</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Writing</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did I write a sonnet? Ope.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I revise a sonnet? Nope!</p></li>
<li><p>Did I blog? Kinda! Mused at least.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I write ahead on Jeb? Wrote a whole and fun chapter, and even did some plotting beforehand to see if it makes writing easier<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Letter to friends? Nope!</p></li>
<li><p>Paper? I spent some time debating different search algorithms that I could use, along with pros and cons of each.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></p></li>

<li id="fn1" role="doc-endnote"><p>side note, I forgot how nice it is to write by candlelight. Even though I also have a real lamp, there’s something about the dynamic movement of a burning candle or candles that really makes all writing feel more special.

Then again, I do know that a large number of academics have taken to posting their papers on their sites, so maybe it’s going to come back for me.

<li id="fn6" role="doc-endnote"><p>a dear friend and reader pointed out that I use the phrase “for all that” very regularly in my writing. I don’t mind that fact, but it’s probably healthy for me to start writing outside of what I’m perfectly comfortable with.

<li id="fn7" role="doc-endnote"><p>i hate that people call it seo optimized, because that’s search engine optimization optimized, and that feels redundant.
