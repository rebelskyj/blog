<p>First Published: 17 January 2025 (because I forgot to hit post)</p>
<h1 id="draft-1-10-january-2025">Draft 1: 10 January 2025</h1>
<p><a href="dietary-needs-2">Yesterday</a> I went through some of the different ways that I could get sufficient protein.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Since I’m<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> not going to just consume all of my protein from a single source, I do technically have an NP problem, which is a variant of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem">knapsack problem</a>. However, I’m looking for solutions that do not fit neatly into the normal computational framework, if only because more or less everything I could consume is functionally continuous, and the knapsack problem is meant for discrete entries.</p>
<p>Chicken, fish, and cheese are all similar in that I need to be eating about a pound a day of them in order to get my nutritional needs met. That’s a fair amount of volume, if nothing else. I can’t really imagine sitting down and eating a pound of any of them in a single sitting<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>However, one piece of advice a friend gave me was to speak to a dietician at my school, which is apparently free. Rather than continue to worry about all of this, I’m going to try to do that instead.</p>
<p>Daily:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Practiced guitar? Not yet today</p></li>
<li><p>Twice daily stretching? The five minutes at night seems so much harder than the one in the morning. Making an actual list of what I do for how long is almost certainly my best option going forward.</p></li>
<li><p>Poetry? I’ve generally been doing two or so stanzas, and usually working on a different ideal each time. Yesterday I was trying for an ABBA rhyme scheme.</p></li>
<li><p>Blog? Look at this right here!</p></li>
<li><p>Net cleaner home?</p></li>
</ul>
