<p>First Published: 2018 December 7</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today, I had the wonderful opportunity to go to the Morpeth Chantry and Northumbrian Bagpipe Museum. While I wouldn’t recommend a trip to Morpeth just for the museum, the city was lovely, and I would highly recommend seeing it.</p>
<p>The museum itself was about the size of a typical exhibit in a full-sized museum, which was a little disappointing. More disappointing was the lack of examples of how the instrument sounds or chances to make it sound myself. They did have a cool thing where they’d rigged a set of the pipes to a piano keyboard so you could play a tune and make it sound, but it was broken.<a href="#fn001" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>However, they’re a completely different beast from either Scottish war pipes or uilleann pipes. They’ve got a closed chanter, and are bellows driven, and look really cute. All this is to say: if anyone has<a href="#fn002" class="footnote-ref" id="fn00ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> a set of Northumbrian Pipes in need of a home, I promise to love and care for them.</p>

<h1 id="the-dilemma-of-digital-diaries"><a href="dilemma-digital-diary.html">The Dilemma of Digital Diaries</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2018 December 6</p>
<h1 id="draft-12-4-december-2018">Draft 12(?): 4 December 2018</h1>
<p>The internet forces change on almost every aspect of human life. These changes can be controversial, especially in literature. Particularly for diaries, the idea shifting from analog to digital formats seemed risk-filled in the early days of the internet.<a href="#fn011" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> But, while the shift in diaries from ink to bits is not inherently problematic, it can alter the form of both diary forms: those meant for the author’s consumption and those meant for public consumption. Many see that public diaries turn into social media posts and blogs, while private diaries turn into password-protected blogs or word documents.</p>
<p>The transition of private diary from analog to digital is a straightforward process. Instead of penning out the words on a paper, the author types the words on a document or webpage. Because of the nature of digital transcription, future archivists will be unable to note handwriting, margin notes, struck words or images drawn. However, a variety of benefits are gained in the switch. For example, if the journal is stored online, the author can access it from anywhere, not only in a single book. It is also far easier to encrypt via software than to cypher by hand. Furthermore, storing the diary digitally allows for easier search, as modern word processors has automated search capabilities. Finally, digital media often save metadata such as location, when words are typed, and what edits are made. These data are not the same as handwriting and margin notes, but can still inform the future reader about the author. While the private digital diary may lose some of the forms that readers can use to learn about the author through how they write, alternate forms of gathering knowledge that are unique to digital media arise to replace them.</p>
<p>The digital public diary, on the other hand, is far more contentious. When discussing the intersection of social media and diaries, it’s important to define both terms. A diary is a work that “focuses on expressing the reality of a contemporaneous account of the author’s passage through time.”<a href="#fn012" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Meanwhile, Wikipedia defines social media as “interactive computer-mediated technologies that facilitate the creation and sharing of information, ideas, career interests and other forms of expression via virtual communities and networks.”<a href="#fn013" class="footnote-ref" id="fn01ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Within these two definitions, we see that the two appear to have some, but not total, overlap. Each definition contains a component crucial to understanding its distinction. For diaries, that component is “contemporaneous account of the author’s passage through time;” for social media, it’s the word “interactive.” Obviously, not all social media are contemporaneous, nor even accounts of authors’ passages through time. One social media with no account of time is Wikipedia, as its social media entry mentions. Because of this distinction, we see that claims of social media being modern diaries are not inherently true. That is, while social media can be diaries, it does not need to be.</p>
<p>However, some social media, such as <a href="instagram.com">Instagram,</a> do function as a type of diary where people post photos with attached captions for public viewing. These status updates are reminiscent of the letter-diaries of James Boswell and Frances Burney, which were read aloud and shared between friends and family. However, Instagram-as-public-diary lacks the crucial component of social media: interaction. People cannot enter into dialogue with the author as in a fully interactive Wikipedia page. Rather, they can comment in ways that clearly come from other entities. So, while diaries themselves are not social media, they can inhabit a social medium. That is, a diary on Instagram is not a social medium, while Instagram itself is.</p>
<p>But this doesn’t address the question of how digitizing public diaries can affect their content. Specifically, many users of Instagram have two profiles: a public profile with information to show that they live a fulfilling life filled with culturally normative behavior, and a private profile (known as a “finsta”) designed to show a small group of peers that they live an exciting life that defies cultural norms. In such a way, the writer of a public diary is now able to appear both societally acceptable and rebellious to different parties, simply by choosing which profile to post on. Likewise, a reader is able to see two disparate views of the author.</p>
<p>The platform itself can also affect the nature of the content. Due to Instagram’s image-centric nature, the focus of a Instagram-hosted diary will be photographic memories of life. In contrast, a Wordpress-diary will focus more on textual accounts of life, due to its text-centric nature. This diversity of platform gives an unprecedented level of choice to authors in how they record their thoughts, especially since they are able to use multiple platforms.</p>
<p>The change of diaries to digital format does not occur without changes to the medium itself. But some of these changes in form can aid future readers in understanding the person they read about, just as other changes can be hindrances. Imagine if we not only had the personal thoughts of Burney written in letters, but photos that she found important coupled with captions explaining why. And, by making diary production digital, authors are now able to choose exactly how to best express their thoughts, which reveals more about themselves.</p>

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today, I was planning on posting my final diary essay. Unfortunately, I never saved the document, and apparently closed it. So, I lost the 12 drafts that I wrote, and only have the final draft. Goes to show what your professors always tell you: save early and often. But, I still have the final draft, which I’ll probably post tomorrow when I’m feeling less annoyed at myself.</p>

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Tonight, I had the wonderful opportunity to attend the Chandos Chamber Choir Christmas Concert at Christ<a href="#fn031" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> the Holy Redeemer Church. In addition to hearing some lovely early music carols, as well as some modern takes on those early songs, there were also some audience sing-alongs. It was great fun, especially because I didn’t know all of the carols. Sadly, they didn’t have the audience sing my two favorite carols,<a href="#fn032" class="footnote-ref" id="fn03ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> but that’s life.</p>
<p>Overall, the concert was a great experience. The choir was good, and the brass quintet was spectacular. They served mince pies, so I had my first ever, which apparently means I get to make a wish. Since finals week is coming up, I’m sure you can guess what I wished for.</p>

<p>First Published 2018 December 3</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>One of the classes I’m enrolled in while abroad is Creative Cartography.<a href="#fn041" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The goal of the class is to explore the different ways that maps can express information and authorship. For a final project, we were assigned the task of creating our own unique map of London. So, being a musical child like I am, I decided to make my end product something auditory.</p>
<p>While discussing with my professor, we had many potential ideas. But, what ended up seeming most fruitful was a one hour walk, where I would follow a series of strangers, logging myself with a stopwatch. Every time that I made a turn, I would start a new lap on the watch. By the end of the hour, I’d accumulated 426 times, so 425 turns. Along with that, I had GPS data tracking my movements and a heart rate monitor that was linked to that GPS.</p>
<p>To create the music, I then needed to find a way to convert the raw data into something musical. I decided to create a melody that could be played solely on the white notes of the piano, rather than other scale options, for a variety of reasons. Had I chosen a pentatonic scale, the data would be harder to express. Had I chosen a chromatic scale, the final piece would have sounded incredibly atonal.</p>
<p>So, I assigned the time in seconds that I had lasted before turning as the basis for the melody. If I walked for less than a second, I would make the melody note an A, for 1-1.99, B, and so on through the scale. Of course, I knew that some of my turns would last seven or more seconds, so I would then repeat. That is, If it took 7-7.99 seconds, I would still have an A. But, in doing so, I would obscure a lot of data.</p>
<p>To combat this, I decided that I would use multiple voices in the final piece. I chose ninth chords, because they have an interesting lack of resolution to them that I thought might allow my music to feel more natural, especially as they tend to have forward movement that is needed when imagining a walk. If the turn would last for less than seven seconds, it would be the root of the chord, seven to 13.99, the third, and so on through the ninth. I assumed that I would then be able to uniquely identify each number of seconds. But, I ended up having ten turns that lasted more than 35 seconds. I decided that I would simply deal with that problem by ignoring it, looping at 35 seconds.</p>
<p>I then had to choose the way that each ninth chord would be constructed. I decided that I didn’t want diminished fifths from the bass, because I didn’t feel like it. My watch was accurate to the .01 seconds, so I kept that in mind.</p>
<p>To decide whether the third would be major or minor, I looked at the fractional time. If it was less than .5, I would make it minor. Otherwise, the third would be major.</p>
<p>The fifth was perfect.</p>
<p>The seventh was major if within .25 seconds 0. That is, from 0-.24 fractional seconds, it would be major. .25-.74 was minor, and .75 and up was again major.</p>
<p>The ninth was determined by the final digit. If the fractional second was even (.00,.02,.04...), it would be major. Otherwise, it would be minor.</p>
<p>By doing this, I constructed a lot of chords that don’t exist in the diatonic world. Of course, then I needed to find a way to automate the calculation of the data, because manually computing 426 data points sounded like a horrible idea, especially since I wouldn’t have the time. So, I automated the production of each note of the chord. I then plotted the melody and bass line, deciding that each chord would be root position. What was left was four voices. Using the principle of parsimonious voice leading,<a href="#fn042" class="footnote-ref" id="fn04ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> I crafted each of the lines by hand. I then uploaded the midi data to a synthesizer, where I mixed the levels a bit until I was satisfied. I did nothing with dynamics or fading because that seemed to detract from the music itself. For tempo, I chose 120 as that is the typical person’s cadence. For voicing, I made sure that the bass was always the lowest and that the soprano was always the highest. The other voices, because of how I wrote them, progressed steadily higher throughout the piece. It creates an interesting effect of growing movement. Happily, it resolves on a CMaj7,9 chord, which fits the C diatonic scale.</p>

<h1 id="reflections-on-todays-gospel"><a href="reflections-on-readings-1-advent-c.html">Reflections on Today’s Gospel</a></h1>
<p>First Published: 2018 December 2</p>
<p>Luke 21:27 “And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.”</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Happy first Sunday in Advent, New Liturgical Year, and First Night of Hanukkah! Advent has always been my favorite season in the Church. It helps that I have really 5 options: Advent, Christmas, Lent, Easter, and Ordinary Time. But, Advent has always been nice because it’s the period where we wait for a wholly positive event to occur. Unlike Easter, which saves our souls at the cost of the Lord’s life, Christmas is nothing more or less than a celebration of the birth of our Savior.</p>
<p>And yet, the Gospel today is not about Christ the meek child being born to a virgin, surrounded by shepherds. Instead, it’s a reference and prophesy about the Lord’s next coming. It tells us that we must stay awake and vigilant, and not be snared by the problems of our life. And really, that’s what Advent is about. It’s a preparatory season where we assess ourselves and begin to hope that we could be worthy to welcome the baby Jesus into the world.</p>
<p>It’s interesting reading today’s readings, because they fall really nicely in a chronology. The First Reading talks about the first coming of Jesus, the season we celebrate in just a few weeks. The Psalm and Second Reading tell us the message Jesus often spoke, that we are to be holy and loving through all that we do. Then, the Gospel talks about the second coming. It’s a great reminder of the way we are to view Advent, which is a celebration of the Lord’s birth, life, and second coming.</p>

<p>First Published 2018 December 1</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As I mentioned <a href="polymer-3.html">yesterday</a>, today we’re talking about crystals. Polymers are known as semi-crystalline, because they have both crystalline and amorphous sections. Some might wonder why polymers can’t be wholly crystalline.<a href="#fn061" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> As I<a href="#fn062" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> have mentioned before, polymers are weird because more or less all of their strength comes from the inter-molecular forces that hold them together, as opposed to normal matter, which I have no clue how it works apparently. Anyways, if a polymer is fully crystalline, it doesn’t have any entanglements with other polymer chains, and so will become a powder, because each polymer is wholly self contained. So, in short, they can it just isn’t useful.</p>
<p>Semi-crystalline<a href="#fn063" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> polymers are especially useful when used in applications where the Heat Distortion Temperature (HDT) is useful, because for most crystalline polymers, the HDT is far larger than the T<sub>g</sub>. Another way to increase the HDT of a polymer is through addition of glass particles. Those increase stiffness, and effectively just shift the modulus of the material directly upwards. Since amorphous polymers lose strength so quickly around T<sub>g</sub>, the addition of glass does nearly nothing. However, crystalline polymers lose strength more slowly, so the addition of particles is helpful.</p>
<p>Crystals in polymers form as lamellae, the ordered regions within a polymer. Lamellae clump together into spherulites, which are what looks like the crystal in a polymer. In order for crystals to form, the polymer must not be atactic.</p>
<p>Polymers can only crystallize when below T<sub>m</sub>, because that’s what T<sub>m</sub> means. When below T<sub>m</sub>, polymer crystallization rate is affected by two factors: nucleation and growth.</p>
<p>Nucleation is the formation of the spherulites. It occurs more quickly the further below T<sub>m</sub> you get, until T<sub>g</sub> is reached, because then the polymer can’t move. Other ways to increase the rate of nucleation include strain/shear stress. In a wholly homogenous polymer, the polymer will spontaneously crystallize, but that is slow. Most polymers have a nucleating agent added to them, commonly sorbitol. But, almost anything in a polymer, including dyes, other polymers, and glass particles can also act as a nucleation point. In general, the more nucleation points there are, the smaller the final size of a spherulite.<a href="#fn064" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Small spherulite size can be beneficial, especially if it can be made smaller than the wavelength of light, so a bottle can be see through.<a href="#fn065" class="footnote-ref" id="fn06ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> The rate of nucleation increases as T drops until T<sub>g</sub>.</p>
<p>The other factor, growth, is exactly what it sounds like. Once nucleated, the spherulites grow. Their growth rate is fastest somewhere between T<sub>m</sub> and T<sub>g</sub>, though closer to T<sub>m</sub>. This is because as T increases, the flexibility of the polymer chain increases. That makes it easier to align, but also easier to unalign. So, by plotting the two rates together, you can find the optimal temperature to cool to in order to let a polymer crystalize.</p>
<p>If, after cooling below T<sub>g</sub>, you realize the polymer needs to be more crystalline, then you can anneal it. That is, you can raise it above T<sub>g</sub> so that the polymer can form into crystals.</p>
<p>Fun fact: although incredibly regular, the chain stiffness of polycarbonate is such that it is not crystalline in consumer uses because of the time required.</p>

<p>First Published 2018 November 30</p>
<p>Prereading note: I actually looked in my notes for this one!</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today we’re talking about the factors that affect T<sub>g</sub> and T<sub>m</sub>. Factors that affect T<sub>g</sub> will affect all polymers, while the factors that affect T<sub>m</sub> will only affect semi-crystalline thermoplastics.</p>
<p>There are four main kinds of factors that affect T<sub>g</sub>: intramolecular forces, intermolecular forces, chain length, and timescale.</p>
<p>The intramolecular forces that affect T<sub>g</sub> are: chain stiffness, side groups, and cross link density. As chain stiffness goes up,<a href="#fn071" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> T<sub>g</sub> goes up. This is because as the amount of energy it takes to rotate along a bond<a href="#fn072" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> increases, so too does T<sub>g</sub>. As side groups become bulkier, they increase T<sub>g</sub>, for the same reason. As cross-link density goes up, so does T<sub>g</sub>, This is because it’s hard to rotate around a link, because the side group is suddenly large. Also, if cross-link density isn’t 0, there is no T<sub>m</sub>.</p>
<p>The intermolecular forces that affect T<sub>g</sub> are: side group dipole moments,<a href="#fn073" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> side group chain length, and plasticizers. As the side groups become more polar, T<sub>g</sub> goes up, because it draws the different polymer chains closer together. For that same reason, as side groups become longer, T<sub>g</sub> goes down, because it keeps them further away. For that same reason, plasticizers also tend to lower T<sub>g</sub>.</p>
<p>Third, assuming the molecular mass is less than M<sub>e</sub>,<a href="#fn074" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> the increase of molecular mass will increase T<sub>g</sub>. Above M<sub>e</sub>, there is effectively no difference in T<sub>g</sub> for chain length.</p>
<p>Finally, everything in polymers is time dependent. This makes sense when you think about how free energy diagrams work. At any temperature above 0K, there’s some energy. Given enough time, any bond can rotate, because it’ll at some point be able to overcome its energy barrier. Heating it just makes that happen faster. So, T<sub>g</sub> decreases as the time-scale you view it from increases. This also works in reverse, so a polymer that’s being stressed at high rates will remain solid at higher temperatures than one that is not.</p>
<p>In order of importance, the intramolecular forces are more important than the intermolecular forces are more important than the other two in governing T<sub>g</sub>.<a href="#fn075" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>So, assuming cross-link density is 0, eventually the polymer will become viscous.<a href="#fn076" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> This is affected mainly by the same factors that influence T<sub>g</sub>, which is why they have the relationship <a href="polymer-2.html">I talked about in Polymer Review 2</a>. As interactions between the chains goes up, T<sub>m</sub> goes up. As chain stiffness goes up, T<sub>m</sub> goes up. As branching<a href="#fn077" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> goes up, T<sub>m</sub> goes down. As delta S<a href="#fn078" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> goes up, T<sub>m</sub> goes down. To explain this, T<sub>m</sub> can also be expressed as delta H<a href="#fn079" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> divided by delta S<a href="#fn0710" class="footnote-ref" id="fn07ref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>. Turning a crystal, which is highly ordered, into a liquid, which is not, increases the entropy of the state a lot. So, somehow that also works in reverse? This part is where the physics goes beyond me.</p>
<p>To lower delta S, you can orient the polymer more. This leads well into crystals which is almost certainly the topic of tomorrow’s post.</p>

<p>Polymers are super cool, for a variety of reasons. The one that I’m thinking of today is that they take all of the things that you get told in chemistry class exist but don’t matter, and then suddenly make them matter. The two examples of that I’m thinking of are the fact that the main force holding polymers together is their Van Der Waals interactions, which is the force I’ve<a href="#fn085" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> always been able to ignore as non-significant for a material. The other is that polymers treat all energy as energy. That is, the temperature that a polymer needs to be at to behave as a liquid is lower if mechanical energy is supplied.</p>
<p>Speaking of, there are a few phases that polymers exist in. I’ll briefly discuss them from lowest to highest temperature.</p>
<p>At the coldest, a polymer is in what’s known as the “glassy” state. Here, it is solid, brittle, and the chains are held rigid.</p>
<p>When you heat up, you’ll eventually reach the glass transition temperature, T<sub>g</sub>. This is the temperature range where the polymer would be described as “leathery.” It also corresponds to a quick drop in modulus.<a href="#fn086" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> This is due to the fact that below T<sub>g</sub>, the energy needed to break the Van Der Waals bonds is higher, because the polymer is moving less. Once you reach T<sub>g</sub>, however, the polymers move enough on their own that the Van Der Waals forces effectively disappear. The only thing that gives the polymer strength then is the entanglements, which we talked about <a href="polymer-1.html">yesterday</a> as M<sub>e</sub>. Above T<sub>g</sub>, you’re in the rubber phase. This is where a polymer behaves a lot like what we think rubber does. And, right near T<sub>g</sub>, the material exhibits a lot of damping.</p>
<p>After T<sub>g</sub>, you reach what’s known as T<sub>m</sub>, which is the temperature where the polymer stops acting like a solid, and begins acting like a fluid. Apparently it’s only melting when crystals do that, so that isn’t what happens to many polymers. One interesting tidbit is that polymers that are crystalline<a href="#fn087" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> will have a T<sub>m</sub> equal to 1.5x the T<sub>g</sub> in Kelvin.</p>
<p>The information about T<sub>m</sub> only applies to thermoplastics, polymers that don’t have chemical crosslinks. If a polymer has crosslinks, it never reaches the viscous phase. Instead, it stays at the “rubber plateau” for modulus until the material ultimately burns.<a href="#fn088" class="footnote-ref" id="fn08ref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>The other thing to note that is different about amorphous and semi-crystalline polymers is that the drop at T<sub>g</sub> is much larger in amorphous polymers than in semi-crystalline, because T<sub>g</sub> is where amorphous regions fail, while T<sub>m</sub> is where the crystalline sections fail. So, since a semi-crystalline polymer has a much smaller composition of amorphous polymer, it loses less strength.</p>

<p>First Published 2018 November 28</p>
<p>Prereading Note: I’ll apologize in advance for what will likely be most of my posts until the end of the semester. Of all the classes I’m in, only one has a final, my class on polymers. So as a way to review, I’ll be describing different concepts here, if only so that I know that I know them.</p>
<h1 id="draft-3-11-december">Draft 3: 11 December</h1>
<p>I was wrong on calculating M<sub>w</sub>.<a href="#fn091" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> To calculate M<sub>w</sub>, you do as I said, and take the chains, 10 of 10 and 10 of 100. Multiply the number of chains by their mass, and sum them (total: 1100). Divide the mass sums of each chain length by the total mass (1/11,10/11). Multiply these numbers by the sum mass of each length (1/11*100+10/11*1000) We end up with a M<sub>w</sub> of approximately 920, which now that I look at it, seems much more reasonable.</p>
<p>M<sub>n</sub> just is the arithmatic mean of the masses. To find it, you sum the mass of all of the chains and divide by the number of chains that are measured.</p>
<p>To find M<sub>w</sub>, you can also sum each chain multiplied by the square of the mass and then divide by the sum of chains multiplied by masses.</p>
<p>M<sub>w</sub></p>
<h1 id="draft-2-30-november">Draft 2: 30 November</h1>
<p>M<sub>e</sub> is the molecular mass required for entanglements to form, as well as the molecular mass between the entanglements apparently, which is really weird and I should reconfirm this with the textbook.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Today, I’ll be discussing the different ways of measuring the mass of a polymer. As far as I remember, there are only four that are relevant to me for the final: M<sub>n</sub>, M<sub>w</sub>, M<sub>z</sub>, and M<sub>e</sub>. I’ll discuss each one in turn, first with how you calculate it, and then what it is used for.</p>
<p>So, first is M<sub>n</sub>. M<sub>n</sub> is the number average molecular mass of a polymer. As such, like M<sub>w</sub> and M<sub>z</sub>, it’s only useful for thermoplastics. To calculate M<sub>n</sub>, you divide the mass of each polymer chain by its numerical representation, then sum all of those. So, if you have 10 chains with a mass of 10, and 10 with a mass of 100, it’s 10/2+100/2 = 55 for M<sub>n</sub>. Since M<sub>n</sub><a href="#fn092" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> is the molecular weight most concerned with the number of short chains, it’s good for telling you about how a polymer will yield, especially once it begins to crack.</p>
<p>Next is M<sub>w</sub>. M<sub>w</sub> is the weight average molecular mass, and is the most common/useful of them. To calculate M<sub>w</sub>, you divide the mass of each polymer chain by its mass representation, then sum all of those. So, in the initial example, 10 chains of 10 and 10 chains of 100, you would get 100+1000=1100, and then 100/1100+1000/1100 = around 92. So, we immediately see that M<sub>w</sub> is more easily measured, because it’s easier to measure the mass of a polymer than the number of chains. M<sub>w</sub> is most relevant for the processability of the polymer, especially its flow in the molten state.</p>
<p>M<sub>z</sub> is weird. Like M<sub>w</sub>, it weights the mass, but it takes it the next step, and does the square of the mass. M<sub>w</sub> is relevant mostly in governing die swell, also known as melt-elasticity.</p>
<p>Finally, we have M<sub>e</sub>. M<sub>e</sub> is the measure of the mass between entanglements. Off the top of my head<a href="#fn093" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> I don’t know how this is measured. But, it’s mostly useful for knowing how strong the polymer will be in the rubber phase.<a href="#fn094" class="footnote-ref" id="fn09ref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>So, yeah. There’s four major ways to say the mass of a polymer. Oh! Also, the difference between M<sub>n</sub> and M<sub>w</sub> is known as the Molecular Weight Distribution, MWD. That tells you how much strain softening will occur. A larger (broader) MWD will lead to more strain softening.</p>
<p>In conclusion, polymers are weird. Hopefully by the end of these posts you’ll understand why if you don’t already.</p>
