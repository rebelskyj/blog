<p>People who know me might know that Iâ€™m somewhat flighty. Despite this, I really try to build my days around touchstones, or events that are required at a certain place and time. This works nicely in a majority of my life, as academics and extracurriculars provide this. Somehow, having anything to do in a day makes me keep track of the entire day so much better.</p>
<p>But, some days donâ€™t have any events. Even Sundays, where I attend Mass, donâ€™t feel like an event, because there are multiple options for time. These past two days in particular, I feel as though time has simply passed me by. I donâ€™t really know where the last 48 hours went, though I know they must have gone somewhere. Such is life I suppose.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>Normally I keep my days very structured. While it isnâ€™t the structure that most people think of,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> I have the entirety of my days flow around focal points, as a way to orient myself. So, when I have days with no imposed structure, they tend to disappear.</p>
<p>Today is a great example of this. I woke up at nearly 11 am, because I had no reason not to. Over the next hour and a half, I apparently wrote.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> After that, I think I watched a tv show until 5, when I helped people make dinner, and then did activities with friends. But, the day still feels as though itâ€™s barely started. I donâ€™t like this feeling.</p>
