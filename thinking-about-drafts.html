<h1 id="thinking-about-drafts"><a href="thinking-about-drafts.html">Thinking About Drafts</a></h1>
<p>First Posted: 2018 October 10<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h1 id="draft-3">Draft 3</h1>
<p>As I mentioned in <a href="disclaimer.html">an earlier post</a>,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> I plan to leave every draft of every post visible for all eternity.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> All of those drafts have come from a<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> continuous writing,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> except in the case of the assignments I have posted, which have taken a few days.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>But, just because I’ve published<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> a post doesn’t mean that it’s finished. I’ve left posts before I was satisfied because I was too tired to continue.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Since my self defined obligation is writing daily, not writing well daily, it’s fine.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, a certain part of my personality<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> demands satisfactory writing out of me. So, I may go back and update old posts. If so, I’ll make a note about the fact that I’ve edited them, and also add in the date of first publication, since that will become relevant afterwards.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h1 id="draft-3-1">Draft 3</h1>
<p>As I mentioned in <a href="disclaimer.html">an earlier post</a>,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> I plan to leave every draft of every one of my posts visible for all eternity.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> All of those drafts have come from a single writing stint, except in the case of the assignments I have posted, which have taken a few days.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>But, just because I’ve published<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> a post doesn’t mean that it’s finished. I’ve more than once left a post not because I was satisfied, but because I was too tired to continue.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Since my self defined obligation is writing daily, not writing well daily, it’s fine.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, a certain part of my personality<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> demands satisfactory writing out of me. So, I may go back and update old posts. If so, I’ll make a note about the fact that I’ve edited them, and also add in the date of first publication, since that will become relevant afterwards.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>New question: what about the drafts of my written assignments that I wrote earlier than the day that they were posted? I think I’m just going to ignore that in the past, and make an effort to remember in the future. Great.</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>As I mentioned in <a href="disclaimer.html">an earlier post</a>,<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> I’m leaving each draft of my posts up for all eternity.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> But, just because I’ve published<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> a post doesn’t mean that it’s finished. I’ve more than once left a post not because I was satisfied, but because I was too tired to continue.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Since my self defined obligation is writing daily, not writing well daily, it’s fine.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, a certain part of my personality<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> demands satisfactory writing out of me. So, I may go back and update old posts. If so, I’ll make a note about the fact that I’ve edited them, and also add in the date of first publication, since that will become relevant afterwards.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Now the question becomes: do I alert my<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> readers about the changes. Advantages: looks like I’m writing even more, lets people see what polished me looks like. Disadvantages: spams other people, I’m not even sure if I want to remember. So, I think I’m not going to make notices when I revise a post, unless there’s a significant reason to. Woo<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> good job writing by the seat of my pants<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> take two.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>As I mentioned in an earlier post,<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> I’m leaving each draft of my posts up for all eternity.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> But, just because I’ve published<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> a post doesn’t mean that it’s finished. Very often, I’ve left the post unsatisfied, but more tired than able to continue writing. So, I publish it and call it good enough.</p>
<p>But what happens when I decide to revise a post later? Should I just add another draft number to the top? Do I make a note after the draft, like “revised this date”? Ooh, does that mean I should start writing when each draft is written? I think I’m actually going to start doing that. Whoops, instead of solving an issue I just made another. Actually, this works. Now I can just add to new drafts, or even at the top of the page, updated this date. Great job writing at the speed of thought.</p>
