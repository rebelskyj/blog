<p>As many of you know, I am a large white man. There are many aspects of these two identities that are incredibly beneficial. What I didn’t really realize today, though, was how important that first identity is.</p>
<p>While getting ready to leave for a theatre show that we were both seeing<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, I mentioned that I thought I might walk there, since I had time. It was around a 2.5 mile walk<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, so I thought there might be an objection due to the length. However, the person I was talking to, who was also a white man, said he wouldn’t feel safe walking there alone.</p>
<p>Now, I’m not sure whether it’s that living in a census-defined <span>“rural”</span> area makes me unafraid and trusting of my fellow person<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, or whether he grew up in a far different place, which led him to his comment. Nonetheless, it struck me that maybe the most important of my three identities is, in fact, large. It goes first when I describe myself<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>, and maybe it belongs there. Where before I thought it was just the white man portion that made me feel safe, I’m reevaluating now to believe that it’s a combination of all three characteristics that lets me feel safe in any situation I find myself in.</p>
<p>But, since the goal of my blog is to be happy and cheerful<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>, I’ll mention the walk. It was a beautiful walk across and then along the River Thames. I got there at sunset, so the river looked amazing. The show was fabulous, with amazing sounds and a flawless set. The acting was of the highest caliber, as was to be expected from its cast.</p>
