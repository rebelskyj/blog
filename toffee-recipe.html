<h1 id="draft-3">Draft 3</h1>
<p>There are some recipes I make mostly as an excuse to make others. Among those is toffee. Nowadays, I mostly<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> make toffee when I’m making chocolate toffee cookies.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> This is not a recipe for the cookies,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> but only for the toffee.</p>
<p>Now, you may notice the preface of “nowadays” for how I make toffee lately. At first, I made toffee for its own sake. The first time I made it, I made it for one of my older brother’s friends. What follows is the fruit of my painstaking<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> trials into making toffee.</p>
<p>Ingredients:<br />
1/2 cup salted butter<br />
1/2 white granulated sugar<br />
1 dash vanilla</p>
<p>Directions:<br />
Put butter in large sauce pan (at least 6x the volume of the butter) over low heat.<br />
When butter is mostly melted, add sugar and vanilla, and mix until well incorporated.<br />
While cooking, it should expand to a much larger size. When it does so, continue stirring until it reaches hard crack,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> or, once you’ve made it a few times, until the aroma and color is correct.<br />
Pour into a well greased sheet pan<br />
Let cool until solid.<br />
Break into pieces.<br />
Serve however you intend to.</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>When I was younger, one of the first recipes I taught myself<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> was toffee. Now, this was not an unprompted decision. A friend of my brother remarked on the expense of it, and after looking at the price, I thought it unreasonable, given how simple the recipe is. And, after much experimentation with other recipes, I’ve found one that works for me. Here it is:</p>
<p>1/2 cup salted butter<br />
1/2 white granulated sugar<br />
1 dash vanilla</p>
<p>Put butter in pan over low heat.<br />
When butter is mostly melted, add sugar and vanilla.<br />
Cook, stirring occasionally until it begins to grow in size.<br />
Continue cooking until when you drop a little into a glass of room temperature water, it cools to a hard, crunchy ball,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> then pour onto a greased sheet pan.<br />
Let cool until solid.<br />
Break into pieces.</p>
<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>When I was a young lad,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> I learned how to make toffee. Now, this was not an unprompted decision. One of my brother’s friends really liked toffee, and I learned this when I received an email from a candy company.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> He asked me how much it would cost to purchase some, and I thought the price looked ridiculous. When I looked up the recipe, it seemed simple enough to make. And, it is!<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> So, a recipe for Toffee:</p>
<p>1/2 cup salted butter<br />
1/2 white granulated sugar<br />
1 dash vanilla</p>
<p>Put butter in pan over low heat.<br />
When butter is mostly melted, add sugar and vanilla.<br />
Cook, stirring occasionally until it begins to grow in size.<br />
Continue cooking until the correct color, then pour onto a greased sheet pan.<br />
Let cool until solid.<br />
Break into pieces.</p>
