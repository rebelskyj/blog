<p>Today, I had the opportunity of attending the Grinnellians in London<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> alumni meetup. It was really interesting. After an hour or so of socializing, we were given a talk about Global Grinnell, and its initiatives.</p>
<p>I found it interesting that the focus was solely on English<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> people we were bringing to Grinnell. When I asked about things that did not fit into this catagory, I was given a few examples in the social studies division, and theatre. I find it odd that we don’t do anything with S and M<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> in a Global Grinnell, especially since more and more students are majoring in those disciplines. But, maybe I just phrased my question badly.</p>
