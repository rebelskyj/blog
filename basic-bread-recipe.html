<h1 id="draft-3">Draft 3</h1>
<p>In my first year of college I gained<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> the moniker of “bread guy.”<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Now, this was not an unforeseeable outcome. I baked<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> bread almost every day, and tended to have the same problem: by the time I finish making bread,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> I don’t really want it anymore, since I would’ve been smelling it for the time it took to cook.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>This problem should have an easy resolution. I would just give it to my friends!<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Of course, sometimes my so called “friends” wouldn’t want to eat the bread I made.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>I know, It’s ridiculous to me too. Who wouldn’t want bread?</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I would need to get rid of the bread another way. My next step would be to find the people who occupy the hard to define mental space of people you know, but have no emotions attached to.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Once I found them,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> I would also offer bread. That also didn’t have a 100% success rate, which hurt less.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I would just walk around campus and hand it out<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> to whoever I saw, and sometimes I would just leave it in public spaces near people who volunteered to dispose of it for me. Nonetheless, I made a lot of bread and got known for it.</p>
<p>Now, the moniker served another purpose.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The CS<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> department<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> at Grinnell College<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a>was<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> growing rapidly, so there were many students who might assume I was related to a member of the department.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> I assumed<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> that being known as “slightly odd person who feeds us” was better than being known as “child of very odd, grumpy, and sarcastic person,” if only because I was being described as my own entity in the first.</p>
<p>But anyways, back to what’s important: bread. My recipe is adapted from <a href="https://artisanbreadinfive.com">this website’s book</a>. I tend to make the dough in a 3 gallon ice cream container from Kilwins, as my family somehow acquired many of them. It exists below.</p>
<p>Basic Bread Dough:</p>
<p>Ingredients:<br />
5 pounds flour<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><br />
8-9 cups water<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><br />
2 heaping tablespoons yeast<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><br />
2 lightly heaping tablespoons kosher salt<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><br />
Note: if making a second batch, if you leave the dough that is leftover in the container, you can skip the yeast.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>To Make Dough:<br />
Add all ingredients together.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><br />
Mix until it seems to be one coherent blob of dough.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><br />
Cover, but not airtightly, and let sit at room temperature until doubled in size.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><br />
Then, cover airtight<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> for up to two weeks<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> The longer you let it sit, the more sour it will be.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>To Cook:<br />
Sprinkle flour on top of dough.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><br />
Pull out a piece of dough the volume of bread you want.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><br />
Generously coating with flour, gently fold it over itself until smooth everywhere except one spot.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><br />
After placing the bread with the spot down,<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> quickly score the surface of the dough with a razor blade, aiming for around half an inch deep.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a><br />
Put onto a stone in an oven preheated for around 30 minutes at 350 F<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> with a stone and a baking tray<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> inside, the tray beneath the stone.<br />
Pour water onto the baking tray.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a><br />
Let cook until bottom is hollow when tapped, or properly golden brown.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a><br />
If in doubt, a few extra minutes never hurts, and often helps.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><br />
Pull out and let cool.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a><br />

<p>I know, It’s ridiculous to me too. I would need to get rid of the bread another way.

<p>So, bread. My recipe is adapted from <a href="https://artisanbreadinfive.com">this website’s book</a>. I tend to make the dough in a 3 gallon ice cream container from Kilwins, as my family somehow acquired many of them. It exists below.</p>
<p>Basic Bread Dough:</p>

Let cook until bottom is hollow when tapped, or properly golden brown.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a><br />
Note: I guess you can add extra water whenever, I just don’t because I’m lazy.<br />
If in doubt, a few extra minutes never hurts, and often helps.<br />
Pull out and let cool.<br />

<h1 id="draft-1">Draft 1</h1>
<p>My freshman year of college, I was nicknamed “the bread guy,”<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Now, this was not an unforeseeable outcome. I baked bread almost every day, and ran into my usual problem with baking bread. By the time the bread would be finished cooking, I wouldn’t really want to eat it anymore, since I would’ve been smelling it for the time it took to cook.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>So, I would need to get rid of it somehow. Thankfully, instead of just setting it on fire,<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> or otherwise wasting it, I would give it to friends. Of course, sometimes my so called “friends” wouldn’t want to eat the bread I made.</p>
<p>I know! It’s ridiculous to me too. So, I would need to get rid of the bread another way. Generally this meant finding the random people you know that you wouldn’t consider friends<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> and offering them some fresh baked bread. Sometimes, I would just walk around campus and hand it out<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> to whoever I saw, and sometimes I would just leave it in public spaces near people who volunteered to dispose of it for me. Nonetheless, I made a lot of bread and got known for it.</p>
<p>There was a motive behind getting this nickname. I knew that, since the CS<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> department<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> was<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> growing rapidly, there were many students who might assume I was related to a member of the department. And, I figured being known as “slightly odd person who feeds us edible home made food” was better than being known as “child of very odd, grumpy, and sarcastic person,” if only because I was being described as my own entity in the first.</p>
<p>So, without further ado: my basic bread recipe. It is adapted from <a href="https://artisanbreadinfive.com">this website’s book</a>. I tend to make the dough in a 3 gallon ice cream container from Kilwins, as my family somehow acquired many of them.</p>
<p>Basic Bread Dough: Ingredients:<br />
5 pounds flour<br />
8-9 cups water<br />
2 heaping tablespoons yeast<br />
2 lightly heaping tablespoons kosher salt</p>
<p>To Make Dough:<br />
Add all ingredients together.<br />
Mix until it seems to be one coherent blob of dough.<br />
Cover, but not totally, and let sit at room temperature for a time lasting between: just barely doubled<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> or up to 2 weeks.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a><br />
The longer you let it sit, the more sour it will be.</p>
<p>To Cook:<br />
Sprinkle flour on top of dough.<br />
Pull out a piece of dough the volume of bread you want.<br />
Generously coating with flour, gently fold it over itself until smooth everywhere except one spot.<br />
Putting that spot down,<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> quickly score the surface of the dough with a razor blade, aiming for around half an inch deep.<br />
Put onto a stone in an oven that has been heating for around 30 minutes at 350 F<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> with a stone inside, and a baking tray<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> beneath it.<br />
Pour water onto the baking tray.<br />
Let cook until bottom is hollow when tapped, or properly golden brown.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a><br />
If in doubt, a few extra minutes never hurts, and often helps.<br />
Pull out and let cool.<br />

<li id="fn19"><p>yes, one bag of flour. I cook on the principle of “needing more than two tools to measure everything is a sign of poorly scaled recipes”<a href="#fnref19" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn22"><p>wow that’s such a vague measurement.
