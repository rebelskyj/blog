<p>Tonight, I had the wonderful opportunity to attend the Chandos Chamber Choir Christmas Concert at Christ<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> the Holy Redeemer Church. In addition to hearing some lovely early music carols, as well as some modern takes on those early songs, there were also some audience sing-alongs. It was great fun, especially because I didn’t know all of the carols. Sadly, they didn’t have the audience sing my two favorite carols,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> but that’s life.</p>
<p>Overall, the concert was a great experience. The choir was good, and the brass quintet was spectacular. They served mince pies, so I had my first ever, which apparently means I get to make a wish. Since finals week is coming up, I’m sure you can guess what I wished for.</p>
