<p>First Published: 2018 November 5</p>
<h1 id="draft-2">Draft 2</h1>
<p>As I mentioned in <a href="basic-bread-recipe.html">an earlier post</a>,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> I used to make bread a lot. But, since coming abroad, I haven’t made bread once. It’s a travesty, I know. To rectify this horrible occasion, on one of the worst anniversaries in British history, I made some bread.</p>
<p>Of course, I had to make adjustments to my general recipe. First, I tend to use five pounds of flour at a recipe. For a variety of reasons, I wasn’t going to do that.</p>
<p>So, I went with my normal way of making things, eyeballing. I poured in maybe too much yeast, but it’s yeast so it doesn’t matter. I then poured in most of the flour we had, poured in some water, and realized that it was far too much water. I realized that, while I had almost no “bread” flour, I had plenty of self-raising flour.</p>
<p>For those of us who don’t know what self raising flour is, it’s flour with a leavening agent mixed in.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Since I didn’t really need one, having yeast and all, I was tempted to throw in some vinegar, to get rid of the leavening. But, since I couldn’t find vinegar, and didn’t feel like putting in the effort, I just went for it.</p>
<p>And, about an hour and a half into rising, I realized that I didn’t really want to wait until tomorrow to eat it, so I made it a semi-knead bread. I just kneaded it, and gave up on rising, so threw it in the oven. As I remember from this summer, I can’t let it sit for 90 minutes, so I’ll come back in the future, but since I’m not editing the draft any other way, it’ll be in this draft.</p>
<p>After cooking for around 20, it looked risen but still too pale. I set another timer for 10 minutes, and threw in more water.</p>
<p>Looked cooked, so out it came. After letting it cool, I opened it, and it smelled bready. It tasted like bread, and that’s the general goal</p>

<p>It’s raising right now, so we’ll see how it goes.</p>
